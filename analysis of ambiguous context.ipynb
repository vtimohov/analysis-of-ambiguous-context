      "[(32, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (33, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (53, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (55, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (56, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (81, 505, 3451, \"All right. So that should be recording now. Um, and I'll go ahead and continue letting everybody in. So today, we're gonna be talking about two different things with Alex. Um, just to introduce myself. My name is Hayley Bradley, one of the math instructional coaches here at Epic. Um, and I think my title just changed to instructional coach, but I'm still very math and oriented and that's why easiest go to. So Alex is, um right now just math, um, with an Epic, I think they do have some chemistry courses and other things as well. Um, we are doing the training based on the information we had last year and I'm going to introduce a couple of changes, um, that are coming this year. Uh, but for the most part, if anything changes, we will know as soon as we have access. So those adjustments will be made on Epic one and we'll be sending out information as well, but we're just gonna kind of go based off of information we had last year, um, and then a couple of changes and then an extension on, um, how you guys want to use Alex. So I'm this is very um open. You guys can ask questions. Um I have the chat on my second screen. So if you want to put them in chat, I will pause every once in a while and kind of answer questions there. I'm gonna start really, really basic. So the 1st 30 minutes I'm gonna do basic assuming you did not use Alex last year. And so I'm gonna give you all that basic training and then from then from there, the last 30 minutes, I'm going to um do a more advanced talking about how you can add objectives um through Alex and you can also add assignments, content editor and different reports um that are, are important to pool. I am going to um and then I am also available for Q and A. Um after this, this is only an hour training. But if you are interested in any um other questions or more in depth or you've got something, but you want to do something a little bit more. I'm happy to do those as well. Oh, perfect. And autumn is in here and she is one of our um SSF and she is, she can answer quite a few questions on Ale on the back end as well. And so she can kind of help us, help us out there. I still have lots of people coming in. So I'm just gonna make sure I get everybody in before I truly start. Um ok, so the first thing is it is a clever login and because we don't have access to Alex right now, the way I'm gonna have you log into the free trial is not the way you will be logging in, um, when we start school. So I just wanna make sure and address that and I'm gonna show you in the slide. It is a mcgraw Hill program. And so it will be a mcgraw Hill app and clever. That's very important to note because I think a lot of teachers kind of put ac T prep um on the back burner for a while last year because we started a little bit later. And then as they tried to get in, they were looking for that Alex app and it's not there. It is a mcgraw Hill program and so it is a mcgraw Hill app and clever. Uh So that will look a little bit different. Um It is that bright red mcgraw hill, uh You wanna click on and log it logs you directly into your course. So straight from Clever, it's an easy, easy log in, you're gonna click on the mcgraw Hill app and all your students should be there. And if their students are not there, you can contact the SSS Department and we can make sure and get all those class um, students in there. The next thing I want to address before we actually go into the program is um the course name. So last year and, um, autumn, you can correct me if I'm wrong if this is not the same way. But I think since it's auto loaded, it will be very similar. It was all your courses were loaded with Alex and then your last name we did that we did and they should be loaded differently. They'll still say Alex because that helps us when we're looking them up. But it will have the grade in there now and we verified that that is working. So it'll say Alex and then the grade. So um it'll say third grade or fourth grade or if it's your AC T prep and there will only be one AC T prep class. You don't have any section there. It'll say whether it is um um algebra one, algebra two or geometry, we also went ahead and included trig or precalc. So you can go ahead and if you order those from spin bridge, then it's the one that you order. So you get to choose the one that you're going to order in spin bridge. It's not auto loaded. Um So you do get a choice in that just make sure that you choose the right one or you get to go fix it. Um So before you make that purchase, just check and see which one you need for your student. Um But yeah, no need to change that class info. Perfect. OK. So we don't have to have this issue this year, last year it was just all the classes were named the same. And so we edited those a little bit, but they fixed that this year, which is awesome. And I'm just gonna kind of follow up on what autumn said. Um, last year, if you had 1/10 grader, we ordered them geometry regardless of if they were ahead or behind. Uh, we just ordered them geometry and then you had to kind of make some adjustments if they were not in that course. Math course this year, it is not that way. As she was saying, you may order what course in Alex you want to um have. So let's say you have 1/10 grader, but they're in algebra two, you would order algebra two for them no matter the grade that they are in. So that's a little bit about what she was saying is a change this year. I will say that there's no need to go back and order it a second time. So Haley could show you how to fix it. You don't have to order Alex twice. Please don't go back to learning fund. Order it a second time thinking you need to for a second class. Um You have access to all of the classes for that student. Um If, if you order algebra two and you're like, wait now they finished it or no, they didn't need algebra two. They needed geometry. You, you can fix that. You don't need to order from the learning fund twice and AC T prep will be automatic. Correct. Adam AC T prep is automatic and this year your ninth grader can get AC T, they'll get AC T prep from their schedule, but you can also order them geometry this year from the learning fund. So geometry is paid for AC T prep is free if they're 1/9 grader. So, but if they want geometry to use as a supplement for their, like their geometry course, they would have to pay for that. So that's the difference. And um that's a really good thing to note that is new this year. AC T prep will be a separate course. So this year it's a little bit different. We did not like the whole combined thing because we had students that were working in algebra one, but we couldn't really determine which part was algebra one and which part was AC T prep. So we've changed that this year. So students will have a grade in AC T prep. It will be a separate course. So if they want to use Alex as a math course, and we'll talk about that a little bit later, but they would order a separate course for math. Um So it'll keep those grades a little bit different and you'll have the distinction between the students that are using it as a math course and the students that are using it for AC T prep. So I felt like that was really important. There was kind of some gray area there last year. So very important. Yes, the AC T is automated for ninth graders, automatic. Um, but if they want to use it as a math course, they would have to order math and pay for that. Um, math course. Outside of that, the sped students have to pay for Alex if they, yes, they will have to. It is a paid um course like paid through the learning from learning fund course if they are using it as a math course. And like I said, I'll talk more about that when we get into exactly what that looks like is using it as a course and not just a supplement because truly Alex is a supplement and I wanna make that very clear. We're using it for AC T prep as a supplement to their regular math course. It could be in play do it could be in apex whatever their math course is. This is a supplement to that, an extra practice for AC T prep. So I do want to jump in and go ahead and show you kind of what it looks like we're gonna first do the student side and I'm gonna also show you the instructor side. So I do want you to on a second screen or on a second tab go to Alex dot com and it is just super easy, Alex dot com. Make sure you type it in. Right. It's not an X. Alex. Well, that's a good question. Autumn. Will that have a great pass back for AC T prep? No, at this time, Alex does not have great pass back, but I'm gonna show you how to easily take those grades and it's one grade per week for AC T prep. It's gonna be super easy. Um, so I want you to click on free trial up here at the top. So we're at Alex dot com. I don't think I need to put that in the chat, but if you need me to, I can, um it's just like I said, a leks dot com and you're gonna click on free trial. So if you wanna follow along with me, please go ahead and go into that free trial at the top and we'll do instructors and administrators and we'll click continue and from here we're gonna go into the student model because I'm gonna show you that first. Um So go to stu explore student model and try Alex now and Rebecca, I think you just joined us. We just went to Alex dot com. It's a Leks dot com. You're gonna agree to the terms and I'm gonna give you guys a little secret here. It asks you to put in some information, but if you don't want emails, you don't have to put in a real email, it'll still go through. Um So, and that came from Alex. Um the Alex rep. They were saying, oh, just put in an Alex email. Um I'm gonna put in K through 12 and then I'm gonna auto in my name. I'm gonna put it. You do have to put a job title and the district. So we can say Epic Charter Schools and this gives us a little bit more information. And down here this is my actual real email, but I'm gonna change it. So I don't, I don't get auto emails. You don't have to put in your real phone number. If you don't want to, you can change your phone number, but you do need to select the course that you want to view. So I am gonna go ahead and put in high school and I'm gonna see if they have should have looked this up earlier. There. It is this year for AC T prep. We are using Mastery of AC T math. And so that's the course I'm gonna go into just because for the majority of us that's what we're gonna be using Alex for. So I'm gonna go into Mastery of AC T math. You can go into any course if you're here for your sped students and you want to go into a middle school or an RT, I course you can go into that as well. Click continue and I'm going to copy the password that it gives me here. You don't have to create your own password. You can just copy and paste the pa the password that they give you. This is not an actual account, it's free account. You're not gonna return to it. It's not gonna be the same password again. You're just gonna do a new free account every time. So I'm gonna click continue and this will take me in as the student. This is really, really important for you guys to see exactly what your students will see. The very first time that they log into Alex, it's really important that you know what it looks like. So when they have a question you can say to them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um You're gonna see a tutorial at first. This is the exactly as they will see, they are gonna get a tutorial, not every time they log in, but the first time they log in and you're just gonna kind of click through this, you can watch it, you can click through it, but every time you log in as a free trial, you will see it every single time. But when the students log in, they will only see it that very first time. So we're gonna get started. It's again, gonna take us through all of the cool things that Alex has. It will show um notifications, it will tell them where to start. And the very first thing in any course in Alex, it will give him that initial knowledge check first. So it's gonna take them through a tools, tutorial on how to use Alex if you have never used Alex before. And you're super curious about it. I think it's really important to know as a math teacher, kind of what the problems look like and how they're going to be answering. So it's really important. So it's telling you to enter the number 14 here. It's telling you that it's correct answer and you can edit if you want to, you can go back, you can click through this tutorial and it will take you through all the steps in Alex. It will show you how to a fraction. It will show you how to graph something, all of those kinds of things. So you guys can go through this or you can skip tutorial and you can skip here and I'm gonna show you that initial knowledge check as well. See, it's showing you how to graph things. You can click on the line, you can erase and all that kind of stuff. So I'm gonna skip the tutorial for now. You are welcome to go back into Alex student view and take a look at that more. And then the next step after the tutorial, they will see their initial knowledge check. If you notice there is nothing they can work on except for that initial knowledge check, they can't click on anything else until they have done the knowledge check. So that's really important to note because if a student is saying, I keep going in and it keeps giving me the knowledge check. It will always have a knowledge check until they have completed it. So they won't be able to go on to anything else and let, until they've completed that knowledge check, I think as a math teacher, it's really cool that you can actually take the knowledge check to see exactly what they are working on. See how hard it is. See how easy it is, all that kind of stuff. Um, it's telling them to stay focused. This is a really important test because if they kind of just click through it, it's gonna start them at the very, very beginning. If they are not paying attention and they miss them, it's going to have to give them a lot of stuff that they already know. So it's important that they stay focused, don't get distracted. It's roughly around 45 minutes to an hour for that knowledge check. So again, it's gonna tell them use pencil and paper, don't get help from your parents or anyone else. And it's going to tell them the remaining topics they have to learn after they're done. So it'll say get started, it will again, take them through the tools of things that they can use and you start the knowledge check. So this is just something really good to get an idea of exactly what your students will see if you'll notice. They have the question bar at the top to show them how many questions they have left. Um And the move you guys out of the way, um It can shortcut keys. It tells you all you can ask for help. Um You can click, I don't know, I would talk to your students and tell them if they really don't know, they can click the, I don't know button. But if they have something, they could possibly guess or they think they might know, I would go ahead and answer that question because they may get it right. And then they don't have to do this questions later. It will say that they've already done that. So you can kind of click through here. You can kind of just give an answer and it will tell them be careful round to the nearest 10th. It will give them sort of hints throughout that. Um I just put an answer down and um, it will not tell them if they got it right or wrong, but it may tell them to be sure to round the nearest tent. So that answer should have been a decimal. It's giving them kind of another cha um another chance to answer that correctly. So I'm gonna skip the knowledge check for now and then it's going to show you the actual um screen that it will show the student after they've taken the knowledge check. Um That's a really good question, Sherry Adam. Do you know that it should, if they used Alex last year, it should have that information. But if they are not in the same course, it will not. So let's say for instance, ac T prep, if they finish that course, actually all the data was wiped and Alex, um so nothing will be saved. Ok. So all the students, all student data, um all courses were wiped from Alex over the summer when we do our summer um clean out of everything and because we also rearranged our schools, um you will not see anything. Um You won't have any archived. You have, we, you won't see any archived courses. You, you won't see anything in Alex when you log back in. So let me tell you though, if you have a student like in that did an Alex course in fourth grade and they started some of the course, they were actually a third grader, but they worked in fourth grade um because they wanted to work ahead and they didn't finish the course. And so that's where they want to start. You would put them back in fourth grade and you would have them take that initial knowledge check guys after the summer slide, they don't need to start where they left off anyway if they haven't done anything over the summer. So it's important for them to take that initial knowledge check again and it will put them back where they um remember the information. So that's something that's really cool about Alex. They give them that knowledge check at, at, at the beginning. Now, I will say that once in Alex, their stuff will stay in Alex. So, and hopefully after this year, we won't have such movement and may and maybe we won't need to delete everything. But this year, there was a need to, to, to take everything out. Um, and well, it'll be a year by year thing to determine if that's necessary this year. It was. So, um so you won't see it this year but hope, you know, once they're in Alex and they have taken things if they, even if they move from teacher to teacher that follows them. Perfect. OK. So I'm gonna select that this student knew little knowledge and Alex. So that will change. You can do little knowledge, moderate knowledge or advanced. The students won't see this, this won't happen. We're just gonna skip the knowledge check and kind of pretend we're a student. So we're gonna continue on. So if you'll notice this is what the student will see after taking the knowledge check, it tells them what they did score well on, they got 62 topics um in um a arithmetic readiness, real numbers, linear equations, linear inequalities, functions in line. So this is where we are, they have mastered 100 and 69 topics and they have 509 remaining. I'm gonna go over ac T requirements. This is not required to finish this course. So you don't want them to freak out about those 500 topics they have left. Um, we're gonna click, continue and then it's gonna ta take them to their entire page within Alex. Um, it's gonna give them again a little tutorial about different information that they will see and you can start their path. That's where they're gonna see that, um, work their path that they have. I'm gonna show you a few things on the student side that you can take a look at. Um, I think I'm not clicking on something here there. You can click on the pie to get more information. Sorry, it's telling me to click on things. This is a timeline when you set things up on the instructor side, it will tell them more of a timeline of where they need to be. And now it says you're all set, you can start your path. I do wanna show you over here that students can create their own worksheets if they want to, if they're going to tutor me, they can create a worksheet themselves. It automatically emails the teacher that worksheet that they generated. Um, so they can know exactly what they're working on. They can see their own reports that are very, very similar to teacher reports. So they can see their own information here. They can see their own grades and what you've entered in the grade book. Um, they can see their assignments if you have given them any assignments. So here's a lot of student information that is straight in the student menu, um, that they can access outside of what, um, is just in their path. The other cool thing is review. Um, they can review on their own. So let's say they've learned something and mastered something, but they wanna go back in and just practice and have them a few hours in Alex, they can review other things on their own. They do not have to just stay in their path. They can review and learn things on their own if they'd like. Ok, so I'm gonna pause on the student side and see if you guys have any questions again. You can go into the path and see exactly what they're working on, but I'm gonna pause for questions. I'm gonna look in the chat, feel free to unmute as well if you want to. And if you are just joining us, we went to Alex dot com and we went in for the free trial on the student view. So this is within the path and they will see a page right here that tells them kind of some information about what they're learning. Um And then from there, you can start and it will give you practice problems. And if you'll notice up here, this is the number of questions you will receive. If you don't get the question right. It will give you an explanation of that question and how they got it wrong and what they got wrong to move on to the next question. Yes, there are videos, let me show you. OK. So over here on the right hand side, let me go over here, there are usually videos, it looks like this one does not have a video on this particular question could be because it's a free trial and not the actual thing. But there are calculators. There are other resources and vocabulary dictionary here and you can also message your teacher through Alex as well. But right here is usually you'll see this little play button and it's a video. 80% of the content in Alex has tutorial videos and they usually have up to five different videos on a single problem. So it is the problem that is there that they are showing them how to work that exact problem, not just some random problem that's pretty similar. It shows them that exact problem and how to work it. They won't get credit for that question because they received the answer, but they will get another question similar to it. And if they get that one right, they'll get question um credit for that question. That makes sense. So the vocabulary in Alex is a little bit different too. It is learned if they answer these five questions correctly and it's moved off of their path. However, they will receive a knowledge check every 20 wait, hang on. I've lost it. Now, five hours and 20 topics. I think that's what it is. It's close to that. Um Every they will receive another knowledge check and when they receive that knowledge check, they will see those problems that they learned again, it will spiral. And if they answer them correctly again, that is when it is mastered and taken off of their pie. So let's say they learned it in some practice problems, but then they see it in the knowledge check and they do not get it correct. It does go back on their pie to learn again to get that information. So you can kind of go through here and just kind of click through what the students see. Like I said, they have lots of resources over here on the right and they have different ways to answer problems. You can actually take the path if you want to and there's a check and an explanation. So let's say I'm gonna guess on this, I don't know what this is. I'm gonna hit an answer and I'm gonna click check and it says incorrect answer. Try again. Sometimes it will tell them exactly what they got incorrect and they can try again. Let's say, I don't know what the correct answer is or how to do it. I want to get an explanation for this problem and it's going to take me to an explanation pa page of that exact problem. And again, it will not give me credit for that question. But I click more practice and it gives me a similar question just like that one, but not the same question. If that makes sense up here at the top, this is the last thing up here at the top. They can choose to work on something else in their path. Let's say we were at linear equations, but I was not enjoying that. I want to go into this readiness course and find a missing link in a figure I can click to work on something else if I want to. So students can click around to work on different topics. Everything up here given to them are things that they were ready to learn based on their initial knowledge check so they can click on any of these and change something for the day. Aha. Here's a video. Do you see these tags videos right here? So here's a video tutorial and how to work these problems. So I'm gonna click on this video and it will give me the teacher name. There are several different instructors that teach, they can click on the same instructor every time or they can click on different ones that explained it a little bit differently. But the same problem are we able to edit the course and change the math course the students are enrolled in. Yes page and I will address that in the 2nd 30 minutes there. We're gonna do a little bit more advanced can we assign topics? Yes. Also going to address that in just a few minutes. Any questions on the student view? Perfect. Ok. So from here we're gonna go into the student, I mean the instructor view on the free trial and I'm gonna talk about all those other things we were just discussing. So there is a way from your instructor view to go into the student view, what we were just in. So I'm gonna at the top, go back to Alex dot com. If you guys are following along, you can just go back to Alex dot com and we're gonna go on the instructor side now. So I'm gonna click free trial again and I'm gonna do instructor and administrators again and this time I'm going to choose the instructor model. So we're gonna go into a course in Alex. It looks a little bit differently. Um I do wanna note that you don't have the ability like that to switch and Alex to like see student or teacher that way. Um I don't want them to think that they have that ability um, when they're looking at Alex and be like, why can't I see it as my student? Um You would have to impersonate your student and clever to see their Alex. True. However, you can see their course the student view course it's just not the actual student. You don't want to be logged in as the student because if you click start my path, it will log that they actually started their path when maybe they haven't worked in Alex. So this is just a generic student view. I'm gonna show you where that is on the free trial. You can't do that but you can in your instructor view. Right. Adam. Uh, I would have to go look, but I just didn't want them to think they have that. Ok. Then they should still be able to this year. I did like, they were just clicking on that outside and I was like, if they, they won't have that button when they log into Alex, like they would have to do it like what you showed them on that with the student view there or impersonate the student. Um. Right. And clever. And the nice thing about not Impersonating the student though is you're not actually logged in as the student, but you can see everything that they see in that type. Of course, if that, that would be a much better option than you're not working at the student. Ok. So you're just going to put K through 12, you put your name? Oklahoma. You don't have to put a correct email address if you don't want free emails. Ok, Christy, I got your message. Um, I'll let you back in when you come back. Ok. So I'm gonna click continue. And again, this is the, um, we're gonna start exploring, you can take a tour, but we're gonna start exploring and I'm gonna choose a course. Normally when you log into Alex and you select a course, you won't have to select a course up here. It'll take you directly to that course. But we're gonna go back into, because we're talking about AC T prep at this time. Um, we're gonna go into that mastery of AC T math if I can find it. See if I can, did I already pass it? Oh, found it. All right. This little number here tells me how many students I have in the course. This is the course I'm looking at. This is a view of the course as a whole. This is not an individual student. So my entire AC T prep has 72% complete in this AC T course. So again, this is a free trial. This is just some information um that they are kind of giving us so that we can kind of take a look if you'll notice it, gives you several reports down here at the bottom with students at the highest, you can click to the lowest pri pi progress. So these are individual student p progress here. That's what those numbers are overall grade. It can give you grades here at the bottom at time and topic report, you can click on any of these to get more information. Um, there is a second page in Alex. So I do want you to see also what that looks like there. Are several topics that your students in this course are ready to learn. 41% are ready to learn this. So these are really great things that you can pull students into a zoom and say 41%. These students are ready to learn this. So you could pull them into a zoom and you could talk to them about that standard or that topic, you could give them a little tutorial and then they could go work on it. Um, so these are just really good reports as well. Um, the student view that I was talking about earlier is right here. You go to class tools and you, you click on it here and it's under student view as a free trial instructor, you can't go from this button, but I will show you what it looks like you click on student view and you enter student view. If you'll notice it says right up here, you cannot access this with the free trial, but you would click enter student view and again, you would not be Impersonating the student. You would just be going into this course as a student to see exactly what it looks like. Exactly what type of topics they see exactly which ones have videos and which ones do not exactly what kind of, you know, how to generate a worksheet, any of that kind of stuff. You can kind of go in as a student and take a look. So to get back where I was. You're gonna click on this waffle over here on the left hand side that gives you all the little tabs that we were just looking at all those little reports and you can click right back there. I'm gonna look at all the things that I was going to cover for this. Ok, student view. So topic goal is next when using AC T prep or any course, it doesn't matter. The students really need to understand exactly what it is they need to complete. Because when you log into Alex, you can just start working and you don't really know exactly what you need to be doing or how much of it or when it's due or any of that. So to make AC T prep really, really easy, we have done 10 topics per week for roughly 22 weeks. We are keeping that same requirement this year. It's just a different course. So if you add those up, that's about 220 topics, right, roughly throughout the year. So when we talk about that, that is not going to be the 500 topics that are in the course like that. Remember we saw they had 500 topics left, so they won't necessarily complete this mastery of AC T math course. That's ok. We just want the, the topics complete. So under um, assignments you're going to assign a topic goal. So we want them to have 10 topics per week. So they see on their side exactly what they need to complete by the end of the week. So we're gonna go to assignments and we're gonna assign a topic goal. So if you'll notice, you will only see, because you haven't assigned anything on your end, you will only see this initial knowledge check. That will give them, that is automatic. Everybody will see that and then you won't see anything else below here. You'll just see this initial knowledge check. So you're gonna go a new assignment and these are step by step in the um quick start guide. So you guys will have these steps step by step on epic one and, and you can readdress them. So we're gonna go to topic goal time is not great in Alex. I'm gonna tell you right now. They can sit for 30 minutes in Alex and just log time. They don't have to actually complete anything. So that's why topic goal is better. So we're gonna go into topic goal. I'm gonna make this a reoccurring topic goal and I'm gonna make it through the end of first semester just so we make sure and get everything that we need um throughout this. So I'm gonna call this a weekly topic goal and it's gonna show in your grade book, which is awesome because the students will know they need to do 10 every week. You will have a grade for how many they did out of that 10 every week, you can easily enter that into the grade book and be done. So this is gonna repeat weekly. We are going to, I always did my grades on Fridays or completion on Fridays. You can do Sunday, you can do Friday, you can do whatever you want to. So I want by Friday for them to have 10 topics complete. I'm gonna start this on the first day of school. You can start at the second week of school if you want to. After you've addressed that, um, you can change the time, whatever you wanna do and then you're gonna say it ends after I'm gonna say 11 weeks, you can take it all the way to December, you can start it at a later time. Um, whatever you wanna do, you're gonna count the number of weeks that they're going to work in first semester. Um, remember it is just one course this year. So they will be able to continue in, um, into that next. You just want that 22 weeks, 10 topics per week. Um, topics learned. We wanna say 10 if you're using it as a supplement for AC T prep. So this is all I'm using it for now and then I am going to award partial credit. That means if they get 10, then they get 100. If they did nine, they get 90 but we don't wanna give all or nothing because that means if they did nine, they get a zero because they didn't match the 10. So we do wanna give partial partial credit and then we're gonna click save. So that gives me an assignment, a weekly topic goal that will now show in the grade book. So when you go to grade book, we're going to click grade book up here. And I do want to take a look at grade book set up before we talk about um the gray back. So if you'll notice they have default percentages, if you are just using this as AC T prep and you are just using the topic goal, then you are only gonna want to put 100% in the topic. We're not going to do any percentage on pie progress or time. If you're using this as a course, obviously, you can use tests and quizzes and homework as different percentages. So this is the grade book set up that you wanna make sure that you have the correct percentage. If you are not using um the pie progress or the time, then you don't need to have any percentages there. So to look at the grade book, we're just gonna go to class grade book here at the top. Again, it will assign to the whole class liberty. It will assign to the whole class. You do not need to set this up individually um for individual students, it will set up your whole grade book all Right. So this, because it's a trial looks a little bit different. But if you'll notice this topic, week one and then topic week two. So this is the grade, the, the topic goal grade that we set. So it shows you what your students got. So this one, this student only did 40% 42% of the, um, 10 topics that we assigned. So let's say they did four and then they started 1/5 1. Well, when they started that fifth one, they got about 2% done. So they get partial credit for that, which is really nice. So we wanna make sure that, that set up these students did all 10 topics. So they got 100% and this is the grade you will enter for AC T prep. So again, it goes topic week one, topic, week two, you will only see topic week three all the way as many topics as you put for there. So if it's for ac T prep only we need to change the setup for topic goals to 100% or did I misunderstand that you would Susan, you would set up the topic goal for 1010 topics per week and that's where that 100% got, um, comes from. This, calculates it as a percent. I mean, Alex does that for you. So it would give you 10 out of 10, 8 out of 10, whatever that is. Does that make sense? Did I answer that question. All right. So the other thing I'm gonna talk about, I'm gonna go back to my, um, set up here. So this gives you step by step on setting a topic goal and a report that you can take a look at the grades are here. This is in the AC T prep, um Epic use. So I just pulled it over here. Um, so this is what I said for semester one. So I will tell you I changed this a little bit from last year. This is in the AC T prep Epic one. But I said 81 to 100 and 10 topics is an A and the reason I said this is for semester one and the reason I said so few at 81 is because remember every 20 topics and five hours they do receive that knowledge check, which is about 45 minutes to an hour. So I tried to give them a little bit and they should in 100 and 10 topics receive like 4 to 5 of those knowledge checks. So I wanted to give them time um based on those knowledge checks like credit for doing some of those if that makes sense. So I that's why I did a range of 80 to 100 and 10 for an A in the grade book. And then this would be your final grade for AC T prep. So that's what I changed a little bit. This year, I did want to give them a little bit of credit for taking those knowledge checks during that time, topics do count towards their pie. Yes. So when they are working on those topics, they learn them, they don't get credit for them unless they've actually learned them within that week. So 10 topics learned in a week, meaning they answered the questions correctly and that goes into their pie. That's what they're working on is their pie. Great question. So this is what that would look like for an a for second semester, 100 and 62 to 220 topics. Again, I tried to give them some credit for taking those knowledge checks every five hours and every 20 topics. Ok? Any questions on AC T requirements or anything that we just looked at in the instructor view. So we went through all of these things for the basic training. So we'll go into using Alex Moore as a core in the next 2030 minutes. So any questions on those, I'm gonna wait for that to come through in the chat and see if you guys have any questions and we're gonna stay in as the instructor and kind of go over some more information as the instructor as I'm waiting for those questions to come through. I do wanna say if you are using Alex as a core, you kind of need to know what you're doing in Alex. It is not a plug and play curriculum. It is not something that you can just put them in and let them work and just take a grade on. It is considered a supplement. So if you are going to use it as a core, you need to set objectives, assign assignments and be conscious of what they are working on within Alex. So that is very important. We kind of went through this, it was a new program last year and we kind of just said, get him in there working in their path, um, and see how it goes. And we kind of realized that you need to know a lot more about exactly what they're covering standard wise and make sure that they're completing those standards within Oklahoma. Can they make? Oh, Reagan, this is a really good question. Excuse me? Can they make up questions from the week before to catch up? They can't in the Alex grade book and let me tell you why the topic goal is for that week and that week only it will close at the end of the week. But let's say a student did eight topics out of 10. So they get an 80 but they feel terrible and they really wanna make that up. They can do 12 topic the next week and you can adjust the grade book, Alex will not adjust on its own that, that student did two more topics the next week. And so it goes through the last week, but you can make that adjustment on your own. In Alex, you can change the grade in Alex or you can just change the grade in Power School. That makes makes sense if a student does 91 week and 11 the next week. Yes, page. Same thing. You can adjust that in the Alex grade book. So on the week they did 12, you can go back to that 80% and you can give them 100% change that 80 to 100% the week before or again, you can just change it in Power School. Really? The grade book and Alex is not the one ones following. It's the one in Power School for AC T prep. So that's the one you want to have accurate, but that's just gonna be teacher discretion. Alex doesn't do that for them, but you can speak to the student and say work ahead two topics this week and I'll give you credit for the week before if that makes sense. Ok? So I'm gonna move into Alex as a core. So I'm gonna go up to up here and I'm gonna go into, let's say we're gonna go into I'm gonna go into a middle school course. So I'm gonna go back and I'll show you what that looks like. I'm gonna go up here if you're following along with me, I'm gonna go right here. No, not to that one. Let me see where that was middle school here it is middle school math course one. That's the sixth grade math. If you'll notice that says level six, that is the sixth grade math course. So that's what I'm gonna go into because I'm gonna talk about using this for my sixth grade math student. So, one of the things I want to talk about is you kind of need to know. I'm gonna click my waffle over here and go back to the tab that homepage. I'm in the grade book now, I'm gonna go back to the home page. There you go. And I'm gonna take a look at my slides real quick. I'll send you these slides. I meant to do that at the beginning and I did not do that, but you kind of need to know what your student. Sixth grade students need to cover within your math curriculum for sixth grade. It's really important that you go to these Oklahoma frameworks. We just did a professional development. Some of the coaches did something on following the frame frameworks. These are really important to get to know exactly what the progression level of 1/6 grade math student is. Um So I'm gonna click on this and take you to it. I'm gonna put this in the chat real quick if you guys wanna follow the framework as well. If you've never seen these, be sure and save this link, bookmark it to your computer and take a look at these perfect when things are loaded to have Alex. Um So we're gonna go into math, click down here and then I'm gonna go to the sixth grade framework for math and then I'm going to go to the suggested learning progression in um for our state's objectives here. OK? Our standards. So in unit one, it tells me exactly. Sorry unit zero is just kind of like a review, growth mindset and problem solving skills things here. But it will tell you what standards are covered in this first unit, what should be covered first within this unit here. So that's what we're going to take a look at and we're gonna kind of follow when creating objectives in Alex. So I'm gonna go over here to force administration and I'm gonna set the objectives for the sixth grade math class based on um the order I want them to see it. If I don't set objectives, they're just gonna be in their path and they can work on several different things that can be very random. Um They can kind of flip flop, that's OK. But in order to make assignments, we kind of need to know what they're working on when so that we can make an assignment. So setting the objectives is really nice because then you can just make an assignment over those objectives that we just did or they just covered. Sorry. Um I'm gonna go into class summary class administration and then class summary again, these steps are in the Epic U and on Epic one as well. So first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to go to um I'm gonna set this content customization. I think hang on. I may have to click around for a second. I get them confused when I'm doing content editor. Yes. OK. So I'm going to set um they changed it from objectives to modules. Let's see. So this is gonna give me a set module of things that we can cover. So if you'll notice unit one is area and surface area, so this gives me what Alex suggests, the progression order for them to be. Um So it will tell you how many topics that is, you can move those around. So that's what I'm talking about. You can set these as is or you can take a look at the Oklahoma framework and kind of move these around based on what the Oklahoma framework is. Um So if you'll notice introducing ratios, if the Oklahoma framework has that come before um c area and surface area, you can kind of move these around. So we're gonna move this to the top, you'll notice that, move that up. Oh, we can't easily do that because it has due dates. Hang on. Yeah. Unify. Is that moving it? 123? Yes. Unit five moved up. But let's see if we can move unit three yet. OK. So then we moved to the unit three above that one, that one is moving. I don't know why that date. It's because the date changed. So we need to move the dates differently so we can change the dates there. So unit one, if you'll notice the dates are here that will close. So the students need to be able to finish that topic within that date range. And if they don't, it will close and you will have to make those adjustments there. That makes sense. So this is by date, but you can also do it by percentage. Let me see where that is without due dates, switch modules without due dates. So we're gonna click here and then it will say so they are gonna work on unit one until they hit 90%. You can change that percentage to 80% and then they will not have the next unit unlocked until they've hit that 80% no matter the due date. Does that make sense? So you can do it by percentages or you can do it by due date? If you do it with dates, it's the whole class and it closes after that date. If you do it by percentages, each individual student will have to hit a certain percentage before they move on. So it's more individualized that way. Ok, I'm gonna pause for questions on objectives. Sorry, you would scroll down here and click continue and then that will give you information. About what's inside the module. I would recommend 80%. Yes, rather than 90% depends on the students, but I would recommend 80%. So this is asking, do you want all of these topics um selected under this? So select below to see more, you can take out topics or you can rearrange topics within that unit as well. And then I'm also gonna show you how you can add topics as well in an editor. So you can take things out and you can edit them as well. So the reason I'm showing, showing you these topics in an order like a framework order based on Oklahoma standards is because now I can go in and I can go back to assignments. I'm gonna scroll up here. I'm gonna go back to assignments and I'm gonna assign a quiz. Sorry, I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna assign a quiz based on that unit that I just gave. So I can assign a homework over ratios. I can assign a quiz over surface area. I can assign a test over those things. So that's why setting the objectives is really important because you know exactly what they're working on. If you just have students working in their path, you kind of have to dig to see what they last worked on in order to assign something. Does that make sense to everybody? Ok. So under assignments, I'm just gonna click assignments again. This is just like the topic goal and I would probably even, um, as a core have a topic, goal of how many you wanted them to complete per week. I would take a look at several things. How many topics are in the course, divide that out over two semesters. I would also take a look at, um, if you need to add extra assignments or extra quizzes, I would take that into account of the topics per week because your assignments and quizzes are going to be on top of the topics. So I would definitely have more than 10 if you're using it as a core, but it depends on the course and the grade level on how many you would assign per week. Um ok, so from there you would go to new assignment and we're gonna assign, let's say a homework, we're gonna practice some of those ratios that we just did. So here you can do Alex topics or you can do Oklahoma standards because it's a free trial. I can't show you the Oklahoma standards, but it is in there. You can have the due dates for the assignment. You can have it all week long and close on a Friday or you can have it just a single day. You can go to um any previous assignments or they, they just have Alex topics. But th this is where you would choose standards for Oklahoma standards. All of the Alex courses are aligned to Oklahoma standards. So you do have that option. And then I'm gonna go into see it says the unit now that you have the objective set, so it has the unit that you're looking at of what you want to assign and I forgot which one it was. Let's just do surface area. We're gonna do um five questions in surface area. Here is an easy ad. So now you've got a homework assignment of five questions. That's super easy. Now, if you want to get more um in depth, I'm gonna go to surface area. Again, you can go into specific questions and you can add that one, so I can add that question over here. So this is individual exact questions that you want to add or you can easily just add those five questions. So this is gonna be a homework assignment based on the units that you just put in order. Does that make sense to everybody? So again, if you're using Alex as a core, it does take a little bit more effort and you do kind of need to know what you're doing. I am happy to meet with you guys and help you set up your course, but it does need to be much more involved than just the AC T prep supplement of just letting them work in their, in their core. The last thing I'm gonna do um on actually doing the course um using it as a course. I'm gonna go back to class administrator and go to class summary. So I am gonna show you the third grade level courses, fourth grade level courses does not have very many topics. They do not at all. So I would suggest adding more content to the course rather than letting them finish that and move up to a grade level. Ok? So we're gonna go to class summary again and again, all of these steps are on the quick start guide, easy for you to get there, step by step. Um bullet points. Um You don't have to remember all this. But if you wanted to, we went to class administration and then class summary and you're going to um module I it's cut where hang on, hang on. Let me find it. I don't know that it's in here. It's under class content and then I think it says content editor. Let me see if the module will it? Yes, the um Alex Epic one page has the quick start guide on there. I think it's called like Best Practices Q and A. Yeah, I don't think in the OK. I don't think in the free trial I can edit. It says under class content. It says content editor. Oh, I'm sorry. One second, let me my husband let my dog in. I need to let it out. Otherwise you would start hearing the dog barking to get out. Um So normally there is a content edit editor which means it tells you this class content has 374 topics and you can add in more topics. The cool thing about this when you add in topics and it's really just following prompts. I think you guys will be fine. But the cool thing about this is it will also, um, tell you that you added that topic, but this is a prerequisite to that topic. Do you also want to add this one? So it will tell you anything that student needs to know before the topic you added and it will give you that prompt of. Do you wanna, are you sure you don't wanna add this one? It's a prerequisite to something that you added. So it's really nice. Ok, I am going to pause and see if I went through, let me see if I went through objectives, assignments, content editor and then reports. So I will go into reports, um, good reports within Alex and I'm gonna pause real quick for any questions in the chat as I'm doing that. So as you guys are typing, typing those questions, I'm gonna go back to that home page right here with that little waffle to take me to all that stuff. Just so I could kind of see all of this. The reports are right here in some of these tabs, but there's a little bit more in depth than just those. So if you'll click on reports, if you'll notice several things pop up, so I'm gonna talk, um talk about three different reports and I can go quickly if you have to pop out. This is recorded. So I will send this recording out as well. Um If you'll notice that's a good question. Autumn, I'm not sure about that. So hang on, let me address before autumn. Addresses that it says can a student be in more than one class? Meaning can they take geometry and algebra one together? I will tell you that Alex courses are not split into semesters. So if the student wants to take algebra one B, keep in mind that they must test out of all of that content for algebra one A because it's a single course. Algebra is a bad example because I think there is an algebra one B course but like geometry is a full course semester, it's not semester A and B sorry, you long course. So they would have to test out of all of those objectives. So teachers that come to me and say I just need them to be an AL or geometry B I say to them, Alex may not be a good fit unless you think they can test out of all of those objectives for geometry A. Does that make sense? Page algebra two is the same way and then I'm not sure if they can be in two courses. Um So no, I don't think there's a way for us to load two courses um at the same time because it will only you're purchasing one license and it's loaded for that license um from Spin Bridge. So you like, you can't, they can complete one course and then you can load them in a new course. Um And you know, they can take several courses just not simultaneously. Um It would be consecutively just like math. Um So it, I mean, that's kind of how Alex put it to us anyway, Like why would you want them to take them simultaneously? Uh Because that isn't how you learn math anyway. So that, I mean, so we don't load them like that. Um So and the answer, one of the answers to that would be you could put one in Apex and then put the other course in Alex. Um I get real sticky as a math teacher of why would you want them working in two math courses at the same time? Unless it's something like credit recovery like you're saying, but if it's two courses full year, I wouldn't do it at the same time. I would have them complete one. And then Haley, I don't know, like you said, the algebra one A and B but I don't, we don't have it loading like that. It's loading full year for all of them. OK. Um I think all of the Alex courses load full year and page. I see it says uh your student is a senior and doesn't want to graduate this year. Um, I totally get that. I would just encourage them to complete one of the courses first and then move to the next course, like sort of in block scheduling type thing. Um, or like you said, we could do one in Alex and one in Apex or something. Um, credit use this as credit recovery. Christy. I probably need to check on the requirements for credit recovery. I'm not real sure there. Um, and it's, I do wanna address the Fed um, situation too because I want to talk about some of the RT I courses. So I'm gonna quickly do that. So the some of the reports that we're talking about the time and topic report is really good because we're following the topics. Remember. So there's a, a time and topic report that's really good. The progress report tells them all of their progress within Alex. Um, this is the standards report and you can pull the Oklahoma standards that they've covered this one can get very confusing. I'm gonna go ahead and click on it. Um, a lot of people had some trouble with it last year. Um, because we were taking a look at, they had not completed, they had not mastered very many topics or excuse me, very many Oklahoma standards. However, that doesn't mean that they didn't see the standards. It's just that me, it just meant that they haven't completed the entire standard. So some of these are real like some of these numbers in the beginning are really low, but that doesn't mean they haven't seen several topics within that standard. They just haven't mastered the entire standard. Um, so it's like when they're working in progress, they've seen 42% of the standard, but they just haven't mastered the entire thing if that makes sense. Um, you can pull this as an individual student, a student right down or you can switch to your classroom. So this would be classroom right now, 42% of your class has worked in that standard. Um So you can do those either way. So it will pull the Oklahoma standards and what, what they have completed at 100% your entire class or what who is progressing? You can click on any of these percentages and it will take you to the exact students that are working on that and which ones have mastered and which ones have not. Um So you can click into any of those. This TD means that that standard is not in Alex and you um need, it's teacher directed is what that means. You need to make sure that they, the students see that standard. In another aspect, there's not very many of those um within Alex, but there are a few usually, I think within middle school, there's like maybe two or three standards, not very many. Um and you can pull those reports on Alex dot com as well. So the standards report is really good. Again, the time and topic report is really good. It will tell you exact exactly how much time they've spent during the week. If you this, I don't love this table. But, um, right here or graph, but you can take a look down here. It tells you the number of minutes they've spent each day and it will give you a little flag if it says something, um, or what, sorry, that flag is the knowledge check, but it will also give you like a little yellow flag if they're like, maybe they attempted 15 topics and learn zero. Like that's a yellow flag. Um So if you'll notice this three out of three means that they spent 25 minutes and they entered three topics and learned all three. So that's really great. If you'll notice this three out of four, that means they entered four topics, but they learned three of them and one they did not learn. So time and topic report is really great for individual students to see exactly for the week how much they've done in a small amount of time and time frame. This will tell you the total time they've spent in Alex and the total number of topics that they have completed. So any questions from those, the progress report is really good too. I'm not sure how that's gonna look this year compared to last year. So I'm a little hesitant on that one. we pulled detailed progress history last year and it told us everything that the student had done within Alex. So that was a really good report last year that we pulled. Um, if you click on all progress, it will tell you for that student, all the progress that they've done since the first day they were in Alex. Um I think this will still be a good report. This dark blue portion here tells me what they knew on the knowledge check and then the lighter blue is how much they've learned since the last knowledge check. This also tells me that they've worked on 23 topics since their knowledge check. So they actually worked on topics not tested out of in a knowledge check. So here again, the knowledge check, they were, they were given another knowledge check and they scored at 36% and they've worked on 6% since then. And that's 23 topics. They were given another progress, knowledge check on 512, they learned 41% of the, um, topics on the knowledge check. And since then they've worked on 1% or five topics. Um, the I'm gonna show you where here, let me show you real quick on our IC page. So this is epic one on our IC page. There's a professional development library. It's right here. This is the instructional coach page under pages. You'll go to instructional coaches and then if you'll click professional development these recordings are all down here and we are putting them in ELC this year so that if your MD I or principal is tracking PD hours, they will be trackable within ELC. So you can click on any of these and get any recordings here. This, that's the summer PD. Yes. And then if you'll notice Freckle is in here, all of the vendor trainings that have been here and I will add this as soon as this recording is done here. Um Last but not least I want to address the RT I um and other courses within Alex. Again, if you are using Alex as a core, you need to know what you're doing and you really need to attend trainings or come and meet with me so we can set up your course so that we know um what exactly what the students are working on. There are RT I courses in Alex or um like prerequisite courses that let's say a student scored on the initial knowledge check below 10%. You would move them into a course below level and then they would work in that course. But keep in mind that course is really small. It's not the course they're supposed to be in. It's a prerequisite course that you want them to move through quickly and then you would bump them back up to their regular course. It is not a course that they would do instead of you really want them moving through those, um, topics as quickly as possible because they only like roughly like 100 topics. Um, and then you're gonna move them back up to their grade level course. So that is when you go into courses, that is what a lot of these RT I 67 and eight courses are. And I can do like a Fed training because I have prerequisite courses for certain levels that we can kind of go further into. If you have questions about that, we can go into those. But like I said, um, these, let's see how many topics this has. This is RT I six, which would mean it would probably be a third through fifth grade topics um that they would be in and they would master before moving up to 1/6 grade math course. Um But if you'll notice, let's see how many topics are in this course. So there's only 100 and 84 topics in this course. So this would not be a full year course. This would be like a few weeks or a few months and then you would move them back up to grade level after they finish some of these prerequisite scores. Ok. So that's all I have for now, I think. And I'm gonna move to my last slide. Um ok, so that's all I have for now, I'm gonna pause for questions, feel free to unmute. I'm gonna leave the recording going in case we have some really great questions that we want to make sure they're on there. If you don't mind, I would love for you to fill out a survey and let me know what else you would like to see in a training so we can continue these trainings and we can go into more in depth on certain areas. Um The title of this PD was the Alex teacher training and my name is Hayley Bradley again, one of the instructional coaches here at Epic Christy. That's a great question. I do not feel comfortable answering questions like that because I don't know as far as RT I requirements. Um and what that department is requiring as far as success maker. So that is something we would have to check in with RT I and check with them about. Can we create a um course or a group that would help, you know, remediate a specific skill or set of skills for a group of students? So you could assign a specific topic to a student. Is that what you mean? So let's say you had. So a lot of the reports um that we talked about. So let me go into this second page. So, um attempted but did not learn or lost in recent assessment. These give you topics and what students you can click on these and I'll tell you what students, so it will kind of group on your own, what students are working on like which topics they are struggling in or what topics they are doing well in and you can kind of group students that way and then you can assign a specific topic to a student. Yes. Did that answer that question? Angie. I was thinking of like IEP students that I had and you know, that if I wanted to track, um, certain IEP goals or things that came out in star, um, but that would still work to do assignments that way so that I could and progress monitor those things. Yes. Um, there is a really great report too and I don't see it on here. There's an IEP report. It's probably because this is the free trial, but that is a really good report within Alex as well. That tells you a little bit more in depth about what students are covering, um, and how to adjust or where to take their students. Um, we can go more in depth as well on, um, how to move certain students into that RT I course, but not all of your students as well. You can create a subclass and move them into an RT I course and have them working in that course and then when they finish, move them back up to grade level, that's a little bit more in depth like a sped training, um, that you would have working students working in a certain course and moving them back up because you don't want to move the whole class, you may not have all your students at that same level. But if anyone scores below 10% on their initial knowledge, check, Alex does suggest that they will not do well in that course. And they need to be moved to a lower level course and then move back up once they have completed those prerequisites. If that makes sense. Yes. Is it similar to like the sub course that we did last year for the, if you wanted to combine, do a combined AC T algebra for the freshman, it's exactly the same. You would just move into that RT I course. And I actually have, I think it's on the AC T prep. Um You know what, I, I probably just need to send it out the um progression of Alex courses. So like if they score below 10% in seventh grade, they need to be moved to RT I six and then move back up to seventh grade. Um I'm sorry, RT I seven and then move back up. So that RT I seven is gonna be like six and seven or excuse me, 5th and 6th grade math topics that they would complete and then they'd be moved back up to seventh grade if that makes sense. So they're just missing a lot of those prerequisites and that's talking about where they need to be moved. But again, that is like a couple of months, not a full year course to leave them in RT. I, even if they're fed, we really need them moved into grade level topic material. Um As soon as they complete this. That sounds awesome. I really am interested in. I want to know more about that. Perfect. I think I'm gonna go ahead and put together an, an Alex Fed training with that progression chart and kind of talk about that information RT I and sped courses and we can talk a little bit about that again if you're using it, Susan says yes, please. Um If you're using it as a core, I just strongly suggest that you really get in and know a lot about Alex because it, the path is just not enough. We learned that last year students were getting through really quickly on some courses and we just wanna make sure that they're covering all the standards that we want them to cover and they're getting assignments and homework and quizzes what they would get in a regular core. Yeah, I will definitely do that guys for sure. All right, I'm gonna stick around for any questions, but I wanted to let you guys go if you um if you wanna hop out. Um But I will stick around if anybody else has more questions, I'd be happy to answer.\"), (87, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (107, 505, 3451, \"All right. So that should be recording now. Um, and I'll go ahead and continue letting everybody in. So today, we're gonna be talking about two different things with Alex. Um, just to introduce myself. My name is Hayley Bradley, one of the math instructional coaches here at Epic. Um, and I think my title just changed to instructional coach, but I'm still very math and oriented and that's why easiest go to. So Alex is, um right now just math, um, with an Epic, I think they do have some chemistry courses and other things as well. Um, we are doing the training based on the information we had last year and I'm going to introduce a couple of changes, um, that are coming this year. Uh, but for the most part, if anything changes, we will know as soon as we have access. So those adjustments will be made on Epic one and we'll be sending out information as well, but we're just gonna kind of go based off of information we had last year, um, and then a couple of changes and then an extension on, um, how you guys want to use Alex. So I'm this is very um open. You guys can ask questions. Um I have the chat on my second screen. So if you want to put them in chat, I will pause every once in a while and kind of answer questions there. I'm gonna start really, really basic. So the 1st 30 minutes I'm gonna do basic assuming you did not use Alex last year. And so I'm gonna give you all that basic training and then from then from there, the last 30 minutes, I'm going to um do a more advanced talking about how you can add objectives um through Alex and you can also add assignments, content editor and different reports um that are, are important to pool. I am going to um and then I am also available for Q and A. Um after this, this is only an hour training. But if you are interested in any um other questions or more in depth or you've got something, but you want to do something a little bit more. I'm happy to do those as well. Oh, perfect. And autumn is in here and she is one of our um SSF and she is, she can answer quite a few questions on Ale on the back end as well. And so she can kind of help us, help us out there. I still have lots of people coming in. So I'm just gonna make sure I get everybody in before I truly start. Um ok, so the first thing is it is a clever login and because we don't have access to Alex right now, the way I'm gonna have you log into the free trial is not the way you will be logging in, um, when we start school. So I just wanna make sure and address that and I'm gonna show you in the slide. It is a mcgraw Hill program. And so it will be a mcgraw Hill app and clever. That's very important to note because I think a lot of teachers kind of put ac T prep um on the back burner for a while last year because we started a little bit later. And then as they tried to get in, they were looking for that Alex app and it's not there. It is a mcgraw Hill program and so it is a mcgraw Hill app and clever. Uh So that will look a little bit different. Um It is that bright red mcgraw hill, uh You wanna click on and log it logs you directly into your course. So straight from Clever, it's an easy, easy log in, you're gonna click on the mcgraw Hill app and all your students should be there. And if their students are not there, you can contact the SSS Department and we can make sure and get all those class um, students in there. The next thing I want to address before we actually go into the program is um the course name. So last year and, um, autumn, you can correct me if I'm wrong if this is not the same way. But I think since it's auto loaded, it will be very similar. It was all your courses were loaded with Alex and then your last name we did that we did and they should be loaded differently. They'll still say Alex because that helps us when we're looking them up. But it will have the grade in there now and we verified that that is working. So it'll say Alex and then the grade. So um it'll say third grade or fourth grade or if it's your AC T prep and there will only be one AC T prep class. You don't have any section there. It'll say whether it is um um algebra one, algebra two or geometry, we also went ahead and included trig or precalc. So you can go ahead and if you order those from spin bridge, then it's the one that you order. So you get to choose the one that you're going to order in spin bridge. It's not auto loaded. Um So you do get a choice in that just make sure that you choose the right one or you get to go fix it. Um So before you make that purchase, just check and see which one you need for your student. Um But yeah, no need to change that class info. Perfect. OK. So we don't have to have this issue this year, last year it was just all the classes were named the same. And so we edited those a little bit, but they fixed that this year, which is awesome. And I'm just gonna kind of follow up on what autumn said. Um, last year, if you had 1/10 grader, we ordered them geometry regardless of if they were ahead or behind. Uh, we just ordered them geometry and then you had to kind of make some adjustments if they were not in that course. Math course this year, it is not that way. As she was saying, you may order what course in Alex you want to um have. So let's say you have 1/10 grader, but they're in algebra two, you would order algebra two for them no matter the grade that they are in. So that's a little bit about what she was saying is a change this year. I will say that there's no need to go back and order it a second time. So Haley could show you how to fix it. You don't have to order Alex twice. Please don't go back to learning fund. Order it a second time thinking you need to for a second class. Um You have access to all of the classes for that student. Um If, if you order algebra two and you're like, wait now they finished it or no, they didn't need algebra two. They needed geometry. You, you can fix that. You don't need to order from the learning fund twice and AC T prep will be automatic. Correct. Adam AC T prep is automatic and this year your ninth grader can get AC T, they'll get AC T prep from their schedule, but you can also order them geometry this year from the learning fund. So geometry is paid for AC T prep is free if they're 1/9 grader. So, but if they want geometry to use as a supplement for their, like their geometry course, they would have to pay for that. So that's the difference. And um that's a really good thing to note that is new this year. AC T prep will be a separate course. So this year it's a little bit different. We did not like the whole combined thing because we had students that were working in algebra one, but we couldn't really determine which part was algebra one and which part was AC T prep. So we've changed that this year. So students will have a grade in AC T prep. It will be a separate course. So if they want to use Alex as a math course, and we'll talk about that a little bit later, but they would order a separate course for math. Um So it'll keep those grades a little bit different and you'll have the distinction between the students that are using it as a math course and the students that are using it for AC T prep. So I felt like that was really important. There was kind of some gray area there last year. So very important. Yes, the AC T is automated for ninth graders, automatic. Um, but if they want to use it as a math course, they would have to order math and pay for that. Um, math course. Outside of that, the sped students have to pay for Alex if they, yes, they will have to. It is a paid um course like paid through the learning from learning fund course if they are using it as a math course. And like I said, I'll talk more about that when we get into exactly what that looks like is using it as a course and not just a supplement because truly Alex is a supplement and I wanna make that very clear. We're using it for AC T prep as a supplement to their regular math course. It could be in play do it could be in apex whatever their math course is. This is a supplement to that, an extra practice for AC T prep. So I do want to jump in and go ahead and show you kind of what it looks like we're gonna first do the student side and I'm gonna also show you the instructor side. So I do want you to on a second screen or on a second tab go to Alex dot com and it is just super easy, Alex dot com. Make sure you type it in. Right. It's not an X. Alex. Well, that's a good question. Autumn. Will that have a great pass back for AC T prep? No, at this time, Alex does not have great pass back, but I'm gonna show you how to easily take those grades and it's one grade per week for AC T prep. It's gonna be super easy. Um, so I want you to click on free trial up here at the top. So we're at Alex dot com. I don't think I need to put that in the chat, but if you need me to, I can, um it's just like I said, a leks dot com and you're gonna click on free trial. So if you wanna follow along with me, please go ahead and go into that free trial at the top and we'll do instructors and administrators and we'll click continue and from here we're gonna go into the student model because I'm gonna show you that first. Um So go to stu explore student model and try Alex now and Rebecca, I think you just joined us. We just went to Alex dot com. It's a Leks dot com. You're gonna agree to the terms and I'm gonna give you guys a little secret here. It asks you to put in some information, but if you don't want emails, you don't have to put in a real email, it'll still go through. Um So, and that came from Alex. Um the Alex rep. They were saying, oh, just put in an Alex email. Um I'm gonna put in K through 12 and then I'm gonna auto in my name. I'm gonna put it. You do have to put a job title and the district. So we can say Epic Charter Schools and this gives us a little bit more information. And down here this is my actual real email, but I'm gonna change it. So I don't, I don't get auto emails. You don't have to put in your real phone number. If you don't want to, you can change your phone number, but you do need to select the course that you want to view. So I am gonna go ahead and put in high school and I'm gonna see if they have should have looked this up earlier. There. It is this year for AC T prep. We are using Mastery of AC T math. And so that's the course I'm gonna go into just because for the majority of us that's what we're gonna be using Alex for. So I'm gonna go into Mastery of AC T math. You can go into any course if you're here for your sped students and you want to go into a middle school or an RT, I course you can go into that as well. Click continue and I'm going to copy the password that it gives me here. You don't have to create your own password. You can just copy and paste the pa the password that they give you. This is not an actual account, it's free account. You're not gonna return to it. It's not gonna be the same password again. You're just gonna do a new free account every time. So I'm gonna click continue and this will take me in as the student. This is really, really important for you guys to see exactly what your students will see. The very first time that they log into Alex, it's really important that you know what it looks like. So when they have a question you can say to them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um You're gonna see a tutorial at first. This is the exactly as they will see, they are gonna get a tutorial, not every time they log in, but the first time they log in and you're just gonna kind of click through this, you can watch it, you can click through it, but every time you log in as a free trial, you will see it every single time. But when the students log in, they will only see it that very first time. So we're gonna get started. It's again, gonna take us through all of the cool things that Alex has. It will show um notifications, it will tell them where to start. And the very first thing in any course in Alex, it will give him that initial knowledge check first. So it's gonna take them through a tools, tutorial on how to use Alex if you have never used Alex before. And you're super curious about it. I think it's really important to know as a math teacher, kind of what the problems look like and how they're going to be answering. So it's really important. So it's telling you to enter the number 14 here. It's telling you that it's correct answer and you can edit if you want to, you can go back, you can click through this tutorial and it will take you through all the steps in Alex. It will show you how to a fraction. It will show you how to graph something, all of those kinds of things. So you guys can go through this or you can skip tutorial and you can skip here and I'm gonna show you that initial knowledge check as well. See, it's showing you how to graph things. You can click on the line, you can erase and all that kind of stuff. So I'm gonna skip the tutorial for now. You are welcome to go back into Alex student view and take a look at that more. And then the next step after the tutorial, they will see their initial knowledge check. If you notice there is nothing they can work on except for that initial knowledge check, they can't click on anything else until they have done the knowledge check. So that's really important to note because if a student is saying, I keep going in and it keeps giving me the knowledge check. It will always have a knowledge check until they have completed it. So they won't be able to go on to anything else and let, until they've completed that knowledge check, I think as a math teacher, it's really cool that you can actually take the knowledge check to see exactly what they are working on. See how hard it is. See how easy it is, all that kind of stuff. Um, it's telling them to stay focused. This is a really important test because if they kind of just click through it, it's gonna start them at the very, very beginning. If they are not paying attention and they miss them, it's going to have to give them a lot of stuff that they already know. So it's important that they stay focused, don't get distracted. It's roughly around 45 minutes to an hour for that knowledge check. So again, it's gonna tell them use pencil and paper, don't get help from your parents or anyone else. And it's going to tell them the remaining topics they have to learn after they're done. So it'll say get started, it will again, take them through the tools of things that they can use and you start the knowledge check. So this is just something really good to get an idea of exactly what your students will see if you'll notice. They have the question bar at the top to show them how many questions they have left. Um And the move you guys out of the way, um It can shortcut keys. It tells you all you can ask for help. Um You can click, I don't know, I would talk to your students and tell them if they really don't know, they can click the, I don't know button. But if they have something, they could possibly guess or they think they might know, I would go ahead and answer that question because they may get it right. And then they don't have to do this questions later. It will say that they've already done that. So you can kind of click through here. You can kind of just give an answer and it will tell them be careful round to the nearest 10th. It will give them sort of hints throughout that. Um I just put an answer down and um, it will not tell them if they got it right or wrong, but it may tell them to be sure to round the nearest tent. So that answer should have been a decimal. It's giving them kind of another cha um another chance to answer that correctly. So I'm gonna skip the knowledge check for now and then it's going to show you the actual um screen that it will show the student after they've taken the knowledge check. Um That's a really good question, Sherry Adam. Do you know that it should, if they used Alex last year, it should have that information. But if they are not in the same course, it will not. So let's say for instance, ac T prep, if they finish that course, actually all the data was wiped and Alex, um so nothing will be saved. Ok. So all the students, all student data, um all courses were wiped from Alex over the summer when we do our summer um clean out of everything and because we also rearranged our schools, um you will not see anything. Um You won't have any archived. You have, we, you won't see any archived courses. You, you won't see anything in Alex when you log back in. So let me tell you though, if you have a student like in that did an Alex course in fourth grade and they started some of the course, they were actually a third grader, but they worked in fourth grade um because they wanted to work ahead and they didn't finish the course. And so that's where they want to start. You would put them back in fourth grade and you would have them take that initial knowledge check guys after the summer slide, they don't need to start where they left off anyway if they haven't done anything over the summer. So it's important for them to take that initial knowledge check again and it will put them back where they um remember the information. So that's something that's really cool about Alex. They give them that knowledge check at, at, at the beginning. Now, I will say that once in Alex, their stuff will stay in Alex. So, and hopefully after this year, we won't have such movement and may and maybe we won't need to delete everything. But this year, there was a need to, to, to take everything out. Um, and well, it'll be a year by year thing to determine if that's necessary this year. It was. So, um so you won't see it this year but hope, you know, once they're in Alex and they have taken things if they, even if they move from teacher to teacher that follows them. Perfect. OK. So I'm gonna select that this student knew little knowledge and Alex. So that will change. You can do little knowledge, moderate knowledge or advanced. The students won't see this, this won't happen. We're just gonna skip the knowledge check and kind of pretend we're a student. So we're gonna continue on. So if you'll notice this is what the student will see after taking the knowledge check, it tells them what they did score well on, they got 62 topics um in um a arithmetic readiness, real numbers, linear equations, linear inequalities, functions in line. So this is where we are, they have mastered 100 and 69 topics and they have 509 remaining. I'm gonna go over ac T requirements. This is not required to finish this course. So you don't want them to freak out about those 500 topics they have left. Um, we're gonna click, continue and then it's gonna ta take them to their entire page within Alex. Um, it's gonna give them again a little tutorial about different information that they will see and you can start their path. That's where they're gonna see that, um, work their path that they have. I'm gonna show you a few things on the student side that you can take a look at. Um, I think I'm not clicking on something here there. You can click on the pie to get more information. Sorry, it's telling me to click on things. This is a timeline when you set things up on the instructor side, it will tell them more of a timeline of where they need to be. And now it says you're all set, you can start your path. I do wanna show you over here that students can create their own worksheets if they want to, if they're going to tutor me, they can create a worksheet themselves. It automatically emails the teacher that worksheet that they generated. Um, so they can know exactly what they're working on. They can see their own reports that are very, very similar to teacher reports. So they can see their own information here. They can see their own grades and what you've entered in the grade book. Um, they can see their assignments if you have given them any assignments. So here's a lot of student information that is straight in the student menu, um, that they can access outside of what, um, is just in their path. The other cool thing is review. Um, they can review on their own. So let's say they've learned something and mastered something, but they wanna go back in and just practice and have them a few hours in Alex, they can review other things on their own. They do not have to just stay in their path. They can review and learn things on their own if they'd like. Ok, so I'm gonna pause on the student side and see if you guys have any questions again. You can go into the path and see exactly what they're working on, but I'm gonna pause for questions. I'm gonna look in the chat, feel free to unmute as well if you want to. And if you are just joining us, we went to Alex dot com and we went in for the free trial on the student view. So this is within the path and they will see a page right here that tells them kind of some information about what they're learning. Um And then from there, you can start and it will give you practice problems. And if you'll notice up here, this is the number of questions you will receive. If you don't get the question right. It will give you an explanation of that question and how they got it wrong and what they got wrong to move on to the next question. Yes, there are videos, let me show you. OK. So over here on the right hand side, let me go over here, there are usually videos, it looks like this one does not have a video on this particular question could be because it's a free trial and not the actual thing. But there are calculators. There are other resources and vocabulary dictionary here and you can also message your teacher through Alex as well. But right here is usually you'll see this little play button and it's a video. 80% of the content in Alex has tutorial videos and they usually have up to five different videos on a single problem. So it is the problem that is there that they are showing them how to work that exact problem, not just some random problem that's pretty similar. It shows them that exact problem and how to work it. They won't get credit for that question because they received the answer, but they will get another question similar to it. And if they get that one right, they'll get question um credit for that question. That makes sense. So the vocabulary in Alex is a little bit different too. It is learned if they answer these five questions correctly and it's moved off of their path. However, they will receive a knowledge check every 20 wait, hang on. I've lost it. Now, five hours and 20 topics. I think that's what it is. It's close to that. Um Every they will receive another knowledge check and when they receive that knowledge check, they will see those problems that they learned again, it will spiral. And if they answer them correctly again, that is when it is mastered and taken off of their pie. So let's say they learned it in some practice problems, but then they see it in the knowledge check and they do not get it correct. It does go back on their pie to learn again to get that information. So you can kind of go through here and just kind of click through what the students see. Like I said, they have lots of resources over here on the right and they have different ways to answer problems. You can actually take the path if you want to and there's a check and an explanation. So let's say I'm gonna guess on this, I don't know what this is. I'm gonna hit an answer and I'm gonna click check and it says incorrect answer. Try again. Sometimes it will tell them exactly what they got incorrect and they can try again. Let's say, I don't know what the correct answer is or how to do it. I want to get an explanation for this problem and it's going to take me to an explanation pa page of that exact problem. And again, it will not give me credit for that question. But I click more practice and it gives me a similar question just like that one, but not the same question. If that makes sense up here at the top, this is the last thing up here at the top. They can choose to work on something else in their path. Let's say we were at linear equations, but I was not enjoying that. I want to go into this readiness course and find a missing link in a figure I can click to work on something else if I want to. So students can click around to work on different topics. Everything up here given to them are things that they were ready to learn based on their initial knowledge check so they can click on any of these and change something for the day. Aha. Here's a video. Do you see these tags videos right here? So here's a video tutorial and how to work these problems. So I'm gonna click on this video and it will give me the teacher name. There are several different instructors that teach, they can click on the same instructor every time or they can click on different ones that explained it a little bit differently. But the same problem are we able to edit the course and change the math course the students are enrolled in. Yes page and I will address that in the 2nd 30 minutes there. We're gonna do a little bit more advanced can we assign topics? Yes. Also going to address that in just a few minutes. Any questions on the student view? Perfect. Ok. So from here we're gonna go into the student, I mean the instructor view on the free trial and I'm gonna talk about all those other things we were just discussing. So there is a way from your instructor view to go into the student view, what we were just in. So I'm gonna at the top, go back to Alex dot com. If you guys are following along, you can just go back to Alex dot com and we're gonna go on the instructor side now. So I'm gonna click free trial again and I'm gonna do instructor and administrators again and this time I'm going to choose the instructor model. So we're gonna go into a course in Alex. It looks a little bit differently. Um I do wanna note that you don't have the ability like that to switch and Alex to like see student or teacher that way. Um I don't want them to think that they have that ability um, when they're looking at Alex and be like, why can't I see it as my student? Um You would have to impersonate your student and clever to see their Alex. True. However, you can see their course the student view course it's just not the actual student. You don't want to be logged in as the student because if you click start my path, it will log that they actually started their path when maybe they haven't worked in Alex. So this is just a generic student view. I'm gonna show you where that is on the free trial. You can't do that but you can in your instructor view. Right. Adam. Uh, I would have to go look, but I just didn't want them to think they have that. Ok. Then they should still be able to this year. I did like, they were just clicking on that outside and I was like, if they, they won't have that button when they log into Alex, like they would have to do it like what you showed them on that with the student view there or impersonate the student. Um. Right. And clever. And the nice thing about not Impersonating the student though is you're not actually logged in as the student, but you can see everything that they see in that type. Of course, if that, that would be a much better option than you're not working at the student. Ok. So you're just going to put K through 12, you put your name? Oklahoma. You don't have to put a correct email address if you don't want free emails. Ok, Christy, I got your message. Um, I'll let you back in when you come back. Ok. So I'm gonna click continue. And again, this is the, um, we're gonna start exploring, you can take a tour, but we're gonna start exploring and I'm gonna choose a course. Normally when you log into Alex and you select a course, you won't have to select a course up here. It'll take you directly to that course. But we're gonna go back into, because we're talking about AC T prep at this time. Um, we're gonna go into that mastery of AC T math if I can find it. See if I can, did I already pass it? Oh, found it. All right. This little number here tells me how many students I have in the course. This is the course I'm looking at. This is a view of the course as a whole. This is not an individual student. So my entire AC T prep has 72% complete in this AC T course. So again, this is a free trial. This is just some information um that they are kind of giving us so that we can kind of take a look if you'll notice it, gives you several reports down here at the bottom with students at the highest, you can click to the lowest pri pi progress. So these are individual student p progress here. That's what those numbers are overall grade. It can give you grades here at the bottom at time and topic report, you can click on any of these to get more information. Um, there is a second page in Alex. So I do want you to see also what that looks like there. Are several topics that your students in this course are ready to learn. 41% are ready to learn this. So these are really great things that you can pull students into a zoom and say 41%. These students are ready to learn this. So you could pull them into a zoom and you could talk to them about that standard or that topic, you could give them a little tutorial and then they could go work on it. Um, so these are just really good reports as well. Um, the student view that I was talking about earlier is right here. You go to class tools and you, you click on it here and it's under student view as a free trial instructor, you can't go from this button, but I will show you what it looks like you click on student view and you enter student view. If you'll notice it says right up here, you cannot access this with the free trial, but you would click enter student view and again, you would not be Impersonating the student. You would just be going into this course as a student to see exactly what it looks like. Exactly what type of topics they see exactly which ones have videos and which ones do not exactly what kind of, you know, how to generate a worksheet, any of that kind of stuff. You can kind of go in as a student and take a look. So to get back where I was. You're gonna click on this waffle over here on the left hand side that gives you all the little tabs that we were just looking at all those little reports and you can click right back there. I'm gonna look at all the things that I was going to cover for this. Ok, student view. So topic goal is next when using AC T prep or any course, it doesn't matter. The students really need to understand exactly what it is they need to complete. Because when you log into Alex, you can just start working and you don't really know exactly what you need to be doing or how much of it or when it's due or any of that. So to make AC T prep really, really easy, we have done 10 topics per week for roughly 22 weeks. We are keeping that same requirement this year. It's just a different course. So if you add those up, that's about 220 topics, right, roughly throughout the year. So when we talk about that, that is not going to be the 500 topics that are in the course like that. Remember we saw they had 500 topics left, so they won't necessarily complete this mastery of AC T math course. That's ok. We just want the, the topics complete. So under um, assignments you're going to assign a topic goal. So we want them to have 10 topics per week. So they see on their side exactly what they need to complete by the end of the week. So we're gonna go to assignments and we're gonna assign a topic goal. So if you'll notice, you will only see, because you haven't assigned anything on your end, you will only see this initial knowledge check. That will give them, that is automatic. Everybody will see that and then you won't see anything else below here. You'll just see this initial knowledge check. So you're gonna go a new assignment and these are step by step in the um quick start guide. So you guys will have these steps step by step on epic one and, and you can readdress them. So we're gonna go to topic goal time is not great in Alex. I'm gonna tell you right now. They can sit for 30 minutes in Alex and just log time. They don't have to actually complete anything. So that's why topic goal is better. So we're gonna go into topic goal. I'm gonna make this a reoccurring topic goal and I'm gonna make it through the end of first semester just so we make sure and get everything that we need um throughout this. So I'm gonna call this a weekly topic goal and it's gonna show in your grade book, which is awesome because the students will know they need to do 10 every week. You will have a grade for how many they did out of that 10 every week, you can easily enter that into the grade book and be done. So this is gonna repeat weekly. We are going to, I always did my grades on Fridays or completion on Fridays. You can do Sunday, you can do Friday, you can do whatever you want to. So I want by Friday for them to have 10 topics complete. I'm gonna start this on the first day of school. You can start at the second week of school if you want to. After you've addressed that, um, you can change the time, whatever you wanna do and then you're gonna say it ends after I'm gonna say 11 weeks, you can take it all the way to December, you can start it at a later time. Um, whatever you wanna do, you're gonna count the number of weeks that they're going to work in first semester. Um, remember it is just one course this year. So they will be able to continue in, um, into that next. You just want that 22 weeks, 10 topics per week. Um, topics learned. We wanna say 10 if you're using it as a supplement for AC T prep. So this is all I'm using it for now and then I am going to award partial credit. That means if they get 10, then they get 100. If they did nine, they get 90 but we don't wanna give all or nothing because that means if they did nine, they get a zero because they didn't match the 10. So we do wanna give partial partial credit and then we're gonna click save. So that gives me an assignment, a weekly topic goal that will now show in the grade book. So when you go to grade book, we're going to click grade book up here. And I do want to take a look at grade book set up before we talk about um the gray back. So if you'll notice they have default percentages, if you are just using this as AC T prep and you are just using the topic goal, then you are only gonna want to put 100% in the topic. We're not going to do any percentage on pie progress or time. If you're using this as a course, obviously, you can use tests and quizzes and homework as different percentages. So this is the grade book set up that you wanna make sure that you have the correct percentage. If you are not using um the pie progress or the time, then you don't need to have any percentages there. So to look at the grade book, we're just gonna go to class grade book here at the top. Again, it will assign to the whole class liberty. It will assign to the whole class. You do not need to set this up individually um for individual students, it will set up your whole grade book all Right. So this, because it's a trial looks a little bit different. But if you'll notice this topic, week one and then topic week two. So this is the grade, the, the topic goal grade that we set. So it shows you what your students got. So this one, this student only did 40% 42% of the, um, 10 topics that we assigned. So let's say they did four and then they started 1/5 1. Well, when they started that fifth one, they got about 2% done. So they get partial credit for that, which is really nice. So we wanna make sure that, that set up these students did all 10 topics. So they got 100% and this is the grade you will enter for AC T prep. So again, it goes topic week one, topic, week two, you will only see topic week three all the way as many topics as you put for there. So if it's for ac T prep only we need to change the setup for topic goals to 100% or did I misunderstand that you would Susan, you would set up the topic goal for 1010 topics per week and that's where that 100% got, um, comes from. This, calculates it as a percent. I mean, Alex does that for you. So it would give you 10 out of 10, 8 out of 10, whatever that is. Does that make sense? Did I answer that question. All right. So the other thing I'm gonna talk about, I'm gonna go back to my, um, set up here. So this gives you step by step on setting a topic goal and a report that you can take a look at the grades are here. This is in the AC T prep, um Epic use. So I just pulled it over here. Um, so this is what I said for semester one. So I will tell you I changed this a little bit from last year. This is in the AC T prep Epic one. But I said 81 to 100 and 10 topics is an A and the reason I said this is for semester one and the reason I said so few at 81 is because remember every 20 topics and five hours they do receive that knowledge check, which is about 45 minutes to an hour. So I tried to give them a little bit and they should in 100 and 10 topics receive like 4 to 5 of those knowledge checks. So I wanted to give them time um based on those knowledge checks like credit for doing some of those if that makes sense. So I that's why I did a range of 80 to 100 and 10 for an A in the grade book. And then this would be your final grade for AC T prep. So that's what I changed a little bit. This year, I did want to give them a little bit of credit for taking those knowledge checks during that time, topics do count towards their pie. Yes. So when they are working on those topics, they learn them, they don't get credit for them unless they've actually learned them within that week. So 10 topics learned in a week, meaning they answered the questions correctly and that goes into their pie. That's what they're working on is their pie. Great question. So this is what that would look like for an a for second semester, 100 and 62 to 220 topics. Again, I tried to give them some credit for taking those knowledge checks every five hours and every 20 topics. Ok? Any questions on AC T requirements or anything that we just looked at in the instructor view. So we went through all of these things for the basic training. So we'll go into using Alex Moore as a core in the next 2030 minutes. So any questions on those, I'm gonna wait for that to come through in the chat and see if you guys have any questions and we're gonna stay in as the instructor and kind of go over some more information as the instructor as I'm waiting for those questions to come through. I do wanna say if you are using Alex as a core, you kind of need to know what you're doing in Alex. It is not a plug and play curriculum. It is not something that you can just put them in and let them work and just take a grade on. It is considered a supplement. So if you are going to use it as a core, you need to set objectives, assign assignments and be conscious of what they are working on within Alex. So that is very important. We kind of went through this, it was a new program last year and we kind of just said, get him in there working in their path, um, and see how it goes. And we kind of realized that you need to know a lot more about exactly what they're covering standard wise and make sure that they're completing those standards within Oklahoma. Can they make? Oh, Reagan, this is a really good question. Excuse me? Can they make up questions from the week before to catch up? They can't in the Alex grade book and let me tell you why the topic goal is for that week and that week only it will close at the end of the week. But let's say a student did eight topics out of 10. So they get an 80 but they feel terrible and they really wanna make that up. They can do 12 topic the next week and you can adjust the grade book, Alex will not adjust on its own that, that student did two more topics the next week. And so it goes through the last week, but you can make that adjustment on your own. In Alex, you can change the grade in Alex or you can just change the grade in Power School. That makes makes sense if a student does 91 week and 11 the next week. Yes, page. Same thing. You can adjust that in the Alex grade book. So on the week they did 12, you can go back to that 80% and you can give them 100% change that 80 to 100% the week before or again, you can just change it in Power School. Really? The grade book and Alex is not the one ones following. It's the one in Power School for AC T prep. So that's the one you want to have accurate, but that's just gonna be teacher discretion. Alex doesn't do that for them, but you can speak to the student and say work ahead two topics this week and I'll give you credit for the week before if that makes sense. Ok? So I'm gonna move into Alex as a core. So I'm gonna go up to up here and I'm gonna go into, let's say we're gonna go into I'm gonna go into a middle school course. So I'm gonna go back and I'll show you what that looks like. I'm gonna go up here if you're following along with me, I'm gonna go right here. No, not to that one. Let me see where that was middle school here it is middle school math course one. That's the sixth grade math. If you'll notice that says level six, that is the sixth grade math course. So that's what I'm gonna go into because I'm gonna talk about using this for my sixth grade math student. So, one of the things I want to talk about is you kind of need to know. I'm gonna click my waffle over here and go back to the tab that homepage. I'm in the grade book now, I'm gonna go back to the home page. There you go. And I'm gonna take a look at my slides real quick. I'll send you these slides. I meant to do that at the beginning and I did not do that, but you kind of need to know what your student. Sixth grade students need to cover within your math curriculum for sixth grade. It's really important that you go to these Oklahoma frameworks. We just did a professional development. Some of the coaches did something on following the frame frameworks. These are really important to get to know exactly what the progression level of 1/6 grade math student is. Um So I'm gonna click on this and take you to it. I'm gonna put this in the chat real quick if you guys wanna follow the framework as well. If you've never seen these, be sure and save this link, bookmark it to your computer and take a look at these perfect when things are loaded to have Alex. Um So we're gonna go into math, click down here and then I'm gonna go to the sixth grade framework for math and then I'm going to go to the suggested learning progression in um for our state's objectives here. OK? Our standards. So in unit one, it tells me exactly. Sorry unit zero is just kind of like a review, growth mindset and problem solving skills things here. But it will tell you what standards are covered in this first unit, what should be covered first within this unit here. So that's what we're going to take a look at and we're gonna kind of follow when creating objectives in Alex. So I'm gonna go over here to force administration and I'm gonna set the objectives for the sixth grade math class based on um the order I want them to see it. If I don't set objectives, they're just gonna be in their path and they can work on several different things that can be very random. Um They can kind of flip flop, that's OK. But in order to make assignments, we kind of need to know what they're working on when so that we can make an assignment. So setting the objectives is really nice because then you can just make an assignment over those objectives that we just did or they just covered. Sorry. Um I'm gonna go into class summary class administration and then class summary again, these steps are in the Epic U and on Epic one as well. So first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to go to um I'm gonna set this content customization. I think hang on. I may have to click around for a second. I get them confused when I'm doing content editor. Yes. OK. So I'm going to set um they changed it from objectives to modules. Let's see. So this is gonna give me a set module of things that we can cover. So if you'll notice unit one is area and surface area, so this gives me what Alex suggests, the progression order for them to be. Um So it will tell you how many topics that is, you can move those around. So that's what I'm talking about. You can set these as is or you can take a look at the Oklahoma framework and kind of move these around based on what the Oklahoma framework is. Um So if you'll notice introducing ratios, if the Oklahoma framework has that come before um c area and surface area, you can kind of move these around. So we're gonna move this to the top, you'll notice that, move that up. Oh, we can't easily do that because it has due dates. Hang on. Yeah. Unify. Is that moving it? 123? Yes. Unit five moved up. But let's see if we can move unit three yet. OK. So then we moved to the unit three above that one, that one is moving. I don't know why that date. It's because the date changed. So we need to move the dates differently so we can change the dates there. So unit one, if you'll notice the dates are here that will close. So the students need to be able to finish that topic within that date range. And if they don't, it will close and you will have to make those adjustments there. That makes sense. So this is by date, but you can also do it by percentage. Let me see where that is without due dates, switch modules without due dates. So we're gonna click here and then it will say so they are gonna work on unit one until they hit 90%. You can change that percentage to 80% and then they will not have the next unit unlocked until they've hit that 80% no matter the due date. Does that make sense? So you can do it by percentages or you can do it by due date? If you do it with dates, it's the whole class and it closes after that date. If you do it by percentages, each individual student will have to hit a certain percentage before they move on. So it's more individualized that way. Ok, I'm gonna pause for questions on objectives. Sorry, you would scroll down here and click continue and then that will give you information. About what's inside the module. I would recommend 80%. Yes, rather than 90% depends on the students, but I would recommend 80%. So this is asking, do you want all of these topics um selected under this? So select below to see more, you can take out topics or you can rearrange topics within that unit as well. And then I'm also gonna show you how you can add topics as well in an editor. So you can take things out and you can edit them as well. So the reason I'm showing, showing you these topics in an order like a framework order based on Oklahoma standards is because now I can go in and I can go back to assignments. I'm gonna scroll up here. I'm gonna go back to assignments and I'm gonna assign a quiz. Sorry, I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna assign a quiz based on that unit that I just gave. So I can assign a homework over ratios. I can assign a quiz over surface area. I can assign a test over those things. So that's why setting the objectives is really important because you know exactly what they're working on. If you just have students working in their path, you kind of have to dig to see what they last worked on in order to assign something. Does that make sense to everybody? Ok. So under assignments, I'm just gonna click assignments again. This is just like the topic goal and I would probably even, um, as a core have a topic, goal of how many you wanted them to complete per week. I would take a look at several things. How many topics are in the course, divide that out over two semesters. I would also take a look at, um, if you need to add extra assignments or extra quizzes, I would take that into account of the topics per week because your assignments and quizzes are going to be on top of the topics. So I would definitely have more than 10 if you're using it as a core, but it depends on the course and the grade level on how many you would assign per week. Um ok, so from there you would go to new assignment and we're gonna assign, let's say a homework, we're gonna practice some of those ratios that we just did. So here you can do Alex topics or you can do Oklahoma standards because it's a free trial. I can't show you the Oklahoma standards, but it is in there. You can have the due dates for the assignment. You can have it all week long and close on a Friday or you can have it just a single day. You can go to um any previous assignments or they, they just have Alex topics. But th this is where you would choose standards for Oklahoma standards. All of the Alex courses are aligned to Oklahoma standards. So you do have that option. And then I'm gonna go into see it says the unit now that you have the objective set, so it has the unit that you're looking at of what you want to assign and I forgot which one it was. Let's just do surface area. We're gonna do um five questions in surface area. Here is an easy ad. So now you've got a homework assignment of five questions. That's super easy. Now, if you want to get more um in depth, I'm gonna go to surface area. Again, you can go into specific questions and you can add that one, so I can add that question over here. So this is individual exact questions that you want to add or you can easily just add those five questions. So this is gonna be a homework assignment based on the units that you just put in order. Does that make sense to everybody? So again, if you're using Alex as a core, it does take a little bit more effort and you do kind of need to know what you're doing. I am happy to meet with you guys and help you set up your course, but it does need to be much more involved than just the AC T prep supplement of just letting them work in their, in their core. The last thing I'm gonna do um on actually doing the course um using it as a course. I'm gonna go back to class administrator and go to class summary. So I am gonna show you the third grade level courses, fourth grade level courses does not have very many topics. They do not at all. So I would suggest adding more content to the course rather than letting them finish that and move up to a grade level. Ok? So we're gonna go to class summary again and again, all of these steps are on the quick start guide, easy for you to get there, step by step. Um bullet points. Um You don't have to remember all this. But if you wanted to, we went to class administration and then class summary and you're going to um module I it's cut where hang on, hang on. Let me find it. I don't know that it's in here. It's under class content and then I think it says content editor. Let me see if the module will it? Yes, the um Alex Epic one page has the quick start guide on there. I think it's called like Best Practices Q and A. Yeah, I don't think in the OK. I don't think in the free trial I can edit. It says under class content. It says content editor. Oh, I'm sorry. One second, let me my husband let my dog in. I need to let it out. Otherwise you would start hearing the dog barking to get out. Um So normally there is a content edit editor which means it tells you this class content has 374 topics and you can add in more topics. The cool thing about this when you add in topics and it's really just following prompts. I think you guys will be fine. But the cool thing about this is it will also, um, tell you that you added that topic, but this is a prerequisite to that topic. Do you also want to add this one? So it will tell you anything that student needs to know before the topic you added and it will give you that prompt of. Do you wanna, are you sure you don't wanna add this one? It's a prerequisite to something that you added. So it's really nice. Ok, I am going to pause and see if I went through, let me see if I went through objectives, assignments, content editor and then reports. So I will go into reports, um, good reports within Alex and I'm gonna pause real quick for any questions in the chat as I'm doing that. So as you guys are typing, typing those questions, I'm gonna go back to that home page right here with that little waffle to take me to all that stuff. Just so I could kind of see all of this. The reports are right here in some of these tabs, but there's a little bit more in depth than just those. So if you'll click on reports, if you'll notice several things pop up, so I'm gonna talk, um talk about three different reports and I can go quickly if you have to pop out. This is recorded. So I will send this recording out as well. Um If you'll notice that's a good question. Autumn, I'm not sure about that. So hang on, let me address before autumn. Addresses that it says can a student be in more than one class? Meaning can they take geometry and algebra one together? I will tell you that Alex courses are not split into semesters. So if the student wants to take algebra one B, keep in mind that they must test out of all of that content for algebra one A because it's a single course. Algebra is a bad example because I think there is an algebra one B course but like geometry is a full course semester, it's not semester A and B sorry, you long course. So they would have to test out of all of those objectives. So teachers that come to me and say I just need them to be an AL or geometry B I say to them, Alex may not be a good fit unless you think they can test out of all of those objectives for geometry A. Does that make sense? Page algebra two is the same way and then I'm not sure if they can be in two courses. Um So no, I don't think there's a way for us to load two courses um at the same time because it will only you're purchasing one license and it's loaded for that license um from Spin Bridge. So you like, you can't, they can complete one course and then you can load them in a new course. Um And you know, they can take several courses just not simultaneously. Um It would be consecutively just like math. Um So it, I mean, that's kind of how Alex put it to us anyway, Like why would you want them to take them simultaneously? Uh Because that isn't how you learn math anyway. So that, I mean, so we don't load them like that. Um So and the answer, one of the answers to that would be you could put one in Apex and then put the other course in Alex. Um I get real sticky as a math teacher of why would you want them working in two math courses at the same time? Unless it's something like credit recovery like you're saying, but if it's two courses full year, I wouldn't do it at the same time. I would have them complete one. And then Haley, I don't know, like you said, the algebra one A and B but I don't, we don't have it loading like that. It's loading full year for all of them. OK. Um I think all of the Alex courses load full year and page. I see it says uh your student is a senior and doesn't want to graduate this year. Um, I totally get that. I would just encourage them to complete one of the courses first and then move to the next course, like sort of in block scheduling type thing. Um, or like you said, we could do one in Alex and one in Apex or something. Um, credit use this as credit recovery. Christy. I probably need to check on the requirements for credit recovery. I'm not real sure there. Um, and it's, I do wanna address the Fed um, situation too because I want to talk about some of the RT I courses. So I'm gonna quickly do that. So the some of the reports that we're talking about the time and topic report is really good because we're following the topics. Remember. So there's a, a time and topic report that's really good. The progress report tells them all of their progress within Alex. Um, this is the standards report and you can pull the Oklahoma standards that they've covered this one can get very confusing. I'm gonna go ahead and click on it. Um, a lot of people had some trouble with it last year. Um, because we were taking a look at, they had not completed, they had not mastered very many topics or excuse me, very many Oklahoma standards. However, that doesn't mean that they didn't see the standards. It's just that me, it just meant that they haven't completed the entire standard. So some of these are real like some of these numbers in the beginning are really low, but that doesn't mean they haven't seen several topics within that standard. They just haven't mastered the entire standard. Um, so it's like when they're working in progress, they've seen 42% of the standard, but they just haven't mastered the entire thing if that makes sense. Um, you can pull this as an individual student, a student right down or you can switch to your classroom. So this would be classroom right now, 42% of your class has worked in that standard. Um So you can do those either way. So it will pull the Oklahoma standards and what, what they have completed at 100% your entire class or what who is progressing? You can click on any of these percentages and it will take you to the exact students that are working on that and which ones have mastered and which ones have not. Um So you can click into any of those. This TD means that that standard is not in Alex and you um need, it's teacher directed is what that means. You need to make sure that they, the students see that standard. In another aspect, there's not very many of those um within Alex, but there are a few usually, I think within middle school, there's like maybe two or three standards, not very many. Um and you can pull those reports on Alex dot com as well. So the standards report is really good. Again, the time and topic report is really good. It will tell you exact exactly how much time they've spent during the week. If you this, I don't love this table. But, um, right here or graph, but you can take a look down here. It tells you the number of minutes they've spent each day and it will give you a little flag if it says something, um, or what, sorry, that flag is the knowledge check, but it will also give you like a little yellow flag if they're like, maybe they attempted 15 topics and learn zero. Like that's a yellow flag. Um So if you'll notice this three out of three means that they spent 25 minutes and they entered three topics and learned all three. So that's really great. If you'll notice this three out of four, that means they entered four topics, but they learned three of them and one they did not learn. So time and topic report is really great for individual students to see exactly for the week how much they've done in a small amount of time and time frame. This will tell you the total time they've spent in Alex and the total number of topics that they have completed. So any questions from those, the progress report is really good too. I'm not sure how that's gonna look this year compared to last year. So I'm a little hesitant on that one. we pulled detailed progress history last year and it told us everything that the student had done within Alex. So that was a really good report last year that we pulled. Um, if you click on all progress, it will tell you for that student, all the progress that they've done since the first day they were in Alex. Um I think this will still be a good report. This dark blue portion here tells me what they knew on the knowledge check and then the lighter blue is how much they've learned since the last knowledge check. This also tells me that they've worked on 23 topics since their knowledge check. So they actually worked on topics not tested out of in a knowledge check. So here again, the knowledge check, they were, they were given another knowledge check and they scored at 36% and they've worked on 6% since then. And that's 23 topics. They were given another progress, knowledge check on 512, they learned 41% of the, um, topics on the knowledge check. And since then they've worked on 1% or five topics. Um, the I'm gonna show you where here, let me show you real quick on our IC page. So this is epic one on our IC page. There's a professional development library. It's right here. This is the instructional coach page under pages. You'll go to instructional coaches and then if you'll click professional development these recordings are all down here and we are putting them in ELC this year so that if your MD I or principal is tracking PD hours, they will be trackable within ELC. So you can click on any of these and get any recordings here. This, that's the summer PD. Yes. And then if you'll notice Freckle is in here, all of the vendor trainings that have been here and I will add this as soon as this recording is done here. Um Last but not least I want to address the RT I um and other courses within Alex. Again, if you are using Alex as a core, you need to know what you're doing and you really need to attend trainings or come and meet with me so we can set up your course so that we know um what exactly what the students are working on. There are RT I courses in Alex or um like prerequisite courses that let's say a student scored on the initial knowledge check below 10%. You would move them into a course below level and then they would work in that course. But keep in mind that course is really small. It's not the course they're supposed to be in. It's a prerequisite course that you want them to move through quickly and then you would bump them back up to their regular course. It is not a course that they would do instead of you really want them moving through those, um, topics as quickly as possible because they only like roughly like 100 topics. Um, and then you're gonna move them back up to their grade level course. So that is when you go into courses, that is what a lot of these RT I 67 and eight courses are. And I can do like a Fed training because I have prerequisite courses for certain levels that we can kind of go further into. If you have questions about that, we can go into those. But like I said, um, these, let's see how many topics this has. This is RT I six, which would mean it would probably be a third through fifth grade topics um that they would be in and they would master before moving up to 1/6 grade math course. Um But if you'll notice, let's see how many topics are in this course. So there's only 100 and 84 topics in this course. So this would not be a full year course. This would be like a few weeks or a few months and then you would move them back up to grade level after they finish some of these prerequisite scores. Ok. So that's all I have for now, I think. And I'm gonna move to my last slide. Um ok, so that's all I have for now, I'm gonna pause for questions, feel free to unmute. I'm gonna leave the recording going in case we have some really great questions that we want to make sure they're on there. If you don't mind, I would love for you to fill out a survey and let me know what else you would like to see in a training so we can continue these trainings and we can go into more in depth on certain areas. Um The title of this PD was the Alex teacher training and my name is Hayley Bradley again, one of the instructional coaches here at Epic Christy. That's a great question. I do not feel comfortable answering questions like that because I don't know as far as RT I requirements. Um and what that department is requiring as far as success maker. So that is something we would have to check in with RT I and check with them about. Can we create a um course or a group that would help, you know, remediate a specific skill or set of skills for a group of students? So you could assign a specific topic to a student. Is that what you mean? So let's say you had. So a lot of the reports um that we talked about. So let me go into this second page. So, um attempted but did not learn or lost in recent assessment. These give you topics and what students you can click on these and I'll tell you what students, so it will kind of group on your own, what students are working on like which topics they are struggling in or what topics they are doing well in and you can kind of group students that way and then you can assign a specific topic to a student. Yes. Did that answer that question? Angie. I was thinking of like IEP students that I had and you know, that if I wanted to track, um, certain IEP goals or things that came out in star, um, but that would still work to do assignments that way so that I could and progress monitor those things. Yes. Um, there is a really great report too and I don't see it on here. There's an IEP report. It's probably because this is the free trial, but that is a really good report within Alex as well. That tells you a little bit more in depth about what students are covering, um, and how to adjust or where to take their students. Um, we can go more in depth as well on, um, how to move certain students into that RT I course, but not all of your students as well. You can create a subclass and move them into an RT I course and have them working in that course and then when they finish, move them back up to grade level, that's a little bit more in depth like a sped training, um, that you would have working students working in a certain course and moving them back up because you don't want to move the whole class, you may not have all your students at that same level. But if anyone scores below 10% on their initial knowledge, check, Alex does suggest that they will not do well in that course. And they need to be moved to a lower level course and then move back up once they have completed those prerequisites. If that makes sense. Yes. Is it similar to like the sub course that we did last year for the, if you wanted to combine, do a combined AC T algebra for the freshman, it's exactly the same. You would just move into that RT I course. And I actually have, I think it's on the AC T prep. Um You know what, I, I probably just need to send it out the um progression of Alex courses. So like if they score below 10% in seventh grade, they need to be moved to RT I six and then move back up to seventh grade. Um I'm sorry, RT I seven and then move back up. So that RT I seven is gonna be like six and seven or excuse me, 5th and 6th grade math topics that they would complete and then they'd be moved back up to seventh grade if that makes sense. So they're just missing a lot of those prerequisites and that's talking about where they need to be moved. But again, that is like a couple of months, not a full year course to leave them in RT. I, even if they're fed, we really need them moved into grade level topic material. Um As soon as they complete this. That sounds awesome. I really am interested in. I want to know more about that. Perfect. I think I'm gonna go ahead and put together an, an Alex Fed training with that progression chart and kind of talk about that information RT I and sped courses and we can talk a little bit about that again if you're using it, Susan says yes, please. Um If you're using it as a core, I just strongly suggest that you really get in and know a lot about Alex because it, the path is just not enough. We learned that last year students were getting through really quickly on some courses and we just wanna make sure that they're covering all the standards that we want them to cover and they're getting assignments and homework and quizzes what they would get in a regular core. Yeah, I will definitely do that guys for sure. All right, I'm gonna stick around for any questions, but I wanted to let you guys go if you um if you wanna hop out. Um But I will stick around if anybody else has more questions, I'd be happy to answer.\"), (118, 505, 3451, \"All right. So that should be recording now. Um, and I'll go ahead and continue letting everybody in. So today, we're gonna be talking about two different things with Alex. Um, just to introduce myself. My name is Hayley Bradley, one of the math instructional coaches here at Epic. Um, and I think my title just changed to instructional coach, but I'm still very math and oriented and that's why easiest go to. So Alex is, um right now just math, um, with an Epic, I think they do have some chemistry courses and other things as well. Um, we are doing the training based on the information we had last year and I'm going to introduce a couple of changes, um, that are coming this year. Uh, but for the most part, if anything changes, we will know as soon as we have access. So those adjustments will be made on Epic one and we'll be sending out information as well, but we're just gonna kind of go based off of information we had last year, um, and then a couple of changes and then an extension on, um, how you guys want to use Alex. So I'm this is very um open. You guys can ask questions. Um I have the chat on my second screen. So if you want to put them in chat, I will pause every once in a while and kind of answer questions there. I'm gonna start really, really basic. So the 1st 30 minutes I'm gonna do basic assuming you did not use Alex last year. And so I'm gonna give you all that basic training and then from then from there, the last 30 minutes, I'm going to um do a more advanced talking about how you can add objectives um through Alex and you can also add assignments, content editor and different reports um that are, are important to pool. I am going to um and then I am also available for Q and A. Um after this, this is only an hour training. But if you are interested in any um other questions or more in depth or you've got something, but you want to do something a little bit more. I'm happy to do those as well. Oh, perfect. And autumn is in here and she is one of our um SSF and she is, she can answer quite a few questions on Ale on the back end as well. And so she can kind of help us, help us out there. I still have lots of people coming in. So I'm just gonna make sure I get everybody in before I truly start. Um ok, so the first thing is it is a clever login and because we don't have access to Alex right now, the way I'm gonna have you log into the free trial is not the way you will be logging in, um, when we start school. So I just wanna make sure and address that and I'm gonna show you in the slide. It is a mcgraw Hill program. And so it will be a mcgraw Hill app and clever. That's very important to note because I think a lot of teachers kind of put ac T prep um on the back burner for a while last year because we started a little bit later. And then as they tried to get in, they were looking for that Alex app and it's not there. It is a mcgraw Hill program and so it is a mcgraw Hill app and clever. Uh So that will look a little bit different. Um It is that bright red mcgraw hill, uh You wanna click on and log it logs you directly into your course. So straight from Clever, it's an easy, easy log in, you're gonna click on the mcgraw Hill app and all your students should be there. And if their students are not there, you can contact the SSS Department and we can make sure and get all those class um, students in there. The next thing I want to address before we actually go into the program is um the course name. So last year and, um, autumn, you can correct me if I'm wrong if this is not the same way. But I think since it's auto loaded, it will be very similar. It was all your courses were loaded with Alex and then your last name we did that we did and they should be loaded differently. They'll still say Alex because that helps us when we're looking them up. But it will have the grade in there now and we verified that that is working. So it'll say Alex and then the grade. So um it'll say third grade or fourth grade or if it's your AC T prep and there will only be one AC T prep class. You don't have any section there. It'll say whether it is um um algebra one, algebra two or geometry, we also went ahead and included trig or precalc. So you can go ahead and if you order those from spin bridge, then it's the one that you order. So you get to choose the one that you're going to order in spin bridge. It's not auto loaded. Um So you do get a choice in that just make sure that you choose the right one or you get to go fix it. Um So before you make that purchase, just check and see which one you need for your student. Um But yeah, no need to change that class info. Perfect. OK. So we don't have to have this issue this year, last year it was just all the classes were named the same. And so we edited those a little bit, but they fixed that this year, which is awesome. And I'm just gonna kind of follow up on what autumn said. Um, last year, if you had 1/10 grader, we ordered them geometry regardless of if they were ahead or behind. Uh, we just ordered them geometry and then you had to kind of make some adjustments if they were not in that course. Math course this year, it is not that way. As she was saying, you may order what course in Alex you want to um have. So let's say you have 1/10 grader, but they're in algebra two, you would order algebra two for them no matter the grade that they are in. So that's a little bit about what she was saying is a change this year. I will say that there's no need to go back and order it a second time. So Haley could show you how to fix it. You don't have to order Alex twice. Please don't go back to learning fund. Order it a second time thinking you need to for a second class. Um You have access to all of the classes for that student. Um If, if you order algebra two and you're like, wait now they finished it or no, they didn't need algebra two. They needed geometry. You, you can fix that. You don't need to order from the learning fund twice and AC T prep will be automatic. Correct. Adam AC T prep is automatic and this year your ninth grader can get AC T, they'll get AC T prep from their schedule, but you can also order them geometry this year from the learning fund. So geometry is paid for AC T prep is free if they're 1/9 grader. So, but if they want geometry to use as a supplement for their, like their geometry course, they would have to pay for that. So that's the difference. And um that's a really good thing to note that is new this year. AC T prep will be a separate course. So this year it's a little bit different. We did not like the whole combined thing because we had students that were working in algebra one, but we couldn't really determine which part was algebra one and which part was AC T prep. So we've changed that this year. So students will have a grade in AC T prep. It will be a separate course. So if they want to use Alex as a math course, and we'll talk about that a little bit later, but they would order a separate course for math. Um So it'll keep those grades a little bit different and you'll have the distinction between the students that are using it as a math course and the students that are using it for AC T prep. So I felt like that was really important. There was kind of some gray area there last year. So very important. Yes, the AC T is automated for ninth graders, automatic. Um, but if they want to use it as a math course, they would have to order math and pay for that. Um, math course. Outside of that, the sped students have to pay for Alex if they, yes, they will have to. It is a paid um course like paid through the learning from learning fund course if they are using it as a math course. And like I said, I'll talk more about that when we get into exactly what that looks like is using it as a course and not just a supplement because truly Alex is a supplement and I wanna make that very clear. We're using it for AC T prep as a supplement to their regular math course. It could be in play do it could be in apex whatever their math course is. This is a supplement to that, an extra practice for AC T prep. So I do want to jump in and go ahead and show you kind of what it looks like we're gonna first do the student side and I'm gonna also show you the instructor side. So I do want you to on a second screen or on a second tab go to Alex dot com and it is just super easy, Alex dot com. Make sure you type it in. Right. It's not an X. Alex. Well, that's a good question. Autumn. Will that have a great pass back for AC T prep? No, at this time, Alex does not have great pass back, but I'm gonna show you how to easily take those grades and it's one grade per week for AC T prep. It's gonna be super easy. Um, so I want you to click on free trial up here at the top. So we're at Alex dot com. I don't think I need to put that in the chat, but if you need me to, I can, um it's just like I said, a leks dot com and you're gonna click on free trial. So if you wanna follow along with me, please go ahead and go into that free trial at the top and we'll do instructors and administrators and we'll click continue and from here we're gonna go into the student model because I'm gonna show you that first. Um So go to stu explore student model and try Alex now and Rebecca, I think you just joined us. We just went to Alex dot com. It's a Leks dot com. You're gonna agree to the terms and I'm gonna give you guys a little secret here. It asks you to put in some information, but if you don't want emails, you don't have to put in a real email, it'll still go through. Um So, and that came from Alex. Um the Alex rep. They were saying, oh, just put in an Alex email. Um I'm gonna put in K through 12 and then I'm gonna auto in my name. I'm gonna put it. You do have to put a job title and the district. So we can say Epic Charter Schools and this gives us a little bit more information. And down here this is my actual real email, but I'm gonna change it. So I don't, I don't get auto emails. You don't have to put in your real phone number. If you don't want to, you can change your phone number, but you do need to select the course that you want to view. So I am gonna go ahead and put in high school and I'm gonna see if they have should have looked this up earlier. There. It is this year for AC T prep. We are using Mastery of AC T math. And so that's the course I'm gonna go into just because for the majority of us that's what we're gonna be using Alex for. So I'm gonna go into Mastery of AC T math. You can go into any course if you're here for your sped students and you want to go into a middle school or an RT, I course you can go into that as well. Click continue and I'm going to copy the password that it gives me here. You don't have to create your own password. You can just copy and paste the pa the password that they give you. This is not an actual account, it's free account. You're not gonna return to it. It's not gonna be the same password again. You're just gonna do a new free account every time. So I'm gonna click continue and this will take me in as the student. This is really, really important for you guys to see exactly what your students will see. The very first time that they log into Alex, it's really important that you know what it looks like. So when they have a question you can say to them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um You're gonna see a tutorial at first. This is the exactly as they will see, they are gonna get a tutorial, not every time they log in, but the first time they log in and you're just gonna kind of click through this, you can watch it, you can click through it, but every time you log in as a free trial, you will see it every single time. But when the students log in, they will only see it that very first time. So we're gonna get started. It's again, gonna take us through all of the cool things that Alex has. It will show um notifications, it will tell them where to start. And the very first thing in any course in Alex, it will give him that initial knowledge check first. So it's gonna take them through a tools, tutorial on how to use Alex if you have never used Alex before. And you're super curious about it. I think it's really important to know as a math teacher, kind of what the problems look like and how they're going to be answering. So it's really important. So it's telling you to enter the number 14 here. It's telling you that it's correct answer and you can edit if you want to, you can go back, you can click through this tutorial and it will take you through all the steps in Alex. It will show you how to a fraction. It will show you how to graph something, all of those kinds of things. So you guys can go through this or you can skip tutorial and you can skip here and I'm gonna show you that initial knowledge check as well. See, it's showing you how to graph things. You can click on the line, you can erase and all that kind of stuff. So I'm gonna skip the tutorial for now. You are welcome to go back into Alex student view and take a look at that more. And then the next step after the tutorial, they will see their initial knowledge check. If you notice there is nothing they can work on except for that initial knowledge check, they can't click on anything else until they have done the knowledge check. So that's really important to note because if a student is saying, I keep going in and it keeps giving me the knowledge check. It will always have a knowledge check until they have completed it. So they won't be able to go on to anything else and let, until they've completed that knowledge check, I think as a math teacher, it's really cool that you can actually take the knowledge check to see exactly what they are working on. See how hard it is. See how easy it is, all that kind of stuff. Um, it's telling them to stay focused. This is a really important test because if they kind of just click through it, it's gonna start them at the very, very beginning. If they are not paying attention and they miss them, it's going to have to give them a lot of stuff that they already know. So it's important that they stay focused, don't get distracted. It's roughly around 45 minutes to an hour for that knowledge check. So again, it's gonna tell them use pencil and paper, don't get help from your parents or anyone else. And it's going to tell them the remaining topics they have to learn after they're done. So it'll say get started, it will again, take them through the tools of things that they can use and you start the knowledge check. So this is just something really good to get an idea of exactly what your students will see if you'll notice. They have the question bar at the top to show them how many questions they have left. Um And the move you guys out of the way, um It can shortcut keys. It tells you all you can ask for help. Um You can click, I don't know, I would talk to your students and tell them if they really don't know, they can click the, I don't know button. But if they have something, they could possibly guess or they think they might know, I would go ahead and answer that question because they may get it right. And then they don't have to do this questions later. It will say that they've already done that. So you can kind of click through here. You can kind of just give an answer and it will tell them be careful round to the nearest 10th. It will give them sort of hints throughout that. Um I just put an answer down and um, it will not tell them if they got it right or wrong, but it may tell them to be sure to round the nearest tent. So that answer should have been a decimal. It's giving them kind of another cha um another chance to answer that correctly. So I'm gonna skip the knowledge check for now and then it's going to show you the actual um screen that it will show the student after they've taken the knowledge check. Um That's a really good question, Sherry Adam. Do you know that it should, if they used Alex last year, it should have that information. But if they are not in the same course, it will not. So let's say for instance, ac T prep, if they finish that course, actually all the data was wiped and Alex, um so nothing will be saved. Ok. So all the students, all student data, um all courses were wiped from Alex over the summer when we do our summer um clean out of everything and because we also rearranged our schools, um you will not see anything. Um You won't have any archived. You have, we, you won't see any archived courses. You, you won't see anything in Alex when you log back in. So let me tell you though, if you have a student like in that did an Alex course in fourth grade and they started some of the course, they were actually a third grader, but they worked in fourth grade um because they wanted to work ahead and they didn't finish the course. And so that's where they want to start. You would put them back in fourth grade and you would have them take that initial knowledge check guys after the summer slide, they don't need to start where they left off anyway if they haven't done anything over the summer. So it's important for them to take that initial knowledge check again and it will put them back where they um remember the information. So that's something that's really cool about Alex. They give them that knowledge check at, at, at the beginning. Now, I will say that once in Alex, their stuff will stay in Alex. So, and hopefully after this year, we won't have such movement and may and maybe we won't need to delete everything. But this year, there was a need to, to, to take everything out. Um, and well, it'll be a year by year thing to determine if that's necessary this year. It was. So, um so you won't see it this year but hope, you know, once they're in Alex and they have taken things if they, even if they move from teacher to teacher that follows them. Perfect. OK. So I'm gonna select that this student knew little knowledge and Alex. So that will change. You can do little knowledge, moderate knowledge or advanced. The students won't see this, this won't happen. We're just gonna skip the knowledge check and kind of pretend we're a student. So we're gonna continue on. So if you'll notice this is what the student will see after taking the knowledge check, it tells them what they did score well on, they got 62 topics um in um a arithmetic readiness, real numbers, linear equations, linear inequalities, functions in line. So this is where we are, they have mastered 100 and 69 topics and they have 509 remaining. I'm gonna go over ac T requirements. This is not required to finish this course. So you don't want them to freak out about those 500 topics they have left. Um, we're gonna click, continue and then it's gonna ta take them to their entire page within Alex. Um, it's gonna give them again a little tutorial about different information that they will see and you can start their path. That's where they're gonna see that, um, work their path that they have. I'm gonna show you a few things on the student side that you can take a look at. Um, I think I'm not clicking on something here there. You can click on the pie to get more information. Sorry, it's telling me to click on things. This is a timeline when you set things up on the instructor side, it will tell them more of a timeline of where they need to be. And now it says you're all set, you can start your path. I do wanna show you over here that students can create their own worksheets if they want to, if they're going to tutor me, they can create a worksheet themselves. It automatically emails the teacher that worksheet that they generated. Um, so they can know exactly what they're working on. They can see their own reports that are very, very similar to teacher reports. So they can see their own information here. They can see their own grades and what you've entered in the grade book. Um, they can see their assignments if you have given them any assignments. So here's a lot of student information that is straight in the student menu, um, that they can access outside of what, um, is just in their path. The other cool thing is review. Um, they can review on their own. So let's say they've learned something and mastered something, but they wanna go back in and just practice and have them a few hours in Alex, they can review other things on their own. They do not have to just stay in their path. They can review and learn things on their own if they'd like. Ok, so I'm gonna pause on the student side and see if you guys have any questions again. You can go into the path and see exactly what they're working on, but I'm gonna pause for questions. I'm gonna look in the chat, feel free to unmute as well if you want to. And if you are just joining us, we went to Alex dot com and we went in for the free trial on the student view. So this is within the path and they will see a page right here that tells them kind of some information about what they're learning. Um And then from there, you can start and it will give you practice problems. And if you'll notice up here, this is the number of questions you will receive. If you don't get the question right. It will give you an explanation of that question and how they got it wrong and what they got wrong to move on to the next question. Yes, there are videos, let me show you. OK. So over here on the right hand side, let me go over here, there are usually videos, it looks like this one does not have a video on this particular question could be because it's a free trial and not the actual thing. But there are calculators. There are other resources and vocabulary dictionary here and you can also message your teacher through Alex as well. But right here is usually you'll see this little play button and it's a video. 80% of the content in Alex has tutorial videos and they usually have up to five different videos on a single problem. So it is the problem that is there that they are showing them how to work that exact problem, not just some random problem that's pretty similar. It shows them that exact problem and how to work it. They won't get credit for that question because they received the answer, but they will get another question similar to it. And if they get that one right, they'll get question um credit for that question. That makes sense. So the vocabulary in Alex is a little bit different too. It is learned if they answer these five questions correctly and it's moved off of their path. However, they will receive a knowledge check every 20 wait, hang on. I've lost it. Now, five hours and 20 topics. I think that's what it is. It's close to that. Um Every they will receive another knowledge check and when they receive that knowledge check, they will see those problems that they learned again, it will spiral. And if they answer them correctly again, that is when it is mastered and taken off of their pie. So let's say they learned it in some practice problems, but then they see it in the knowledge check and they do not get it correct. It does go back on their pie to learn again to get that information. So you can kind of go through here and just kind of click through what the students see. Like I said, they have lots of resources over here on the right and they have different ways to answer problems. You can actually take the path if you want to and there's a check and an explanation. So let's say I'm gonna guess on this, I don't know what this is. I'm gonna hit an answer and I'm gonna click check and it says incorrect answer. Try again. Sometimes it will tell them exactly what they got incorrect and they can try again. Let's say, I don't know what the correct answer is or how to do it. I want to get an explanation for this problem and it's going to take me to an explanation pa page of that exact problem. And again, it will not give me credit for that question. But I click more practice and it gives me a similar question just like that one, but not the same question. If that makes sense up here at the top, this is the last thing up here at the top. They can choose to work on something else in their path. Let's say we were at linear equations, but I was not enjoying that. I want to go into this readiness course and find a missing link in a figure I can click to work on something else if I want to. So students can click around to work on different topics. Everything up here given to them are things that they were ready to learn based on their initial knowledge check so they can click on any of these and change something for the day. Aha. Here's a video. Do you see these tags videos right here? So here's a video tutorial and how to work these problems. So I'm gonna click on this video and it will give me the teacher name. There are several different instructors that teach, they can click on the same instructor every time or they can click on different ones that explained it a little bit differently. But the same problem are we able to edit the course and change the math course the students are enrolled in. Yes page and I will address that in the 2nd 30 minutes there. We're gonna do a little bit more advanced can we assign topics? Yes. Also going to address that in just a few minutes. Any questions on the student view? Perfect. Ok. So from here we're gonna go into the student, I mean the instructor view on the free trial and I'm gonna talk about all those other things we were just discussing. So there is a way from your instructor view to go into the student view, what we were just in. So I'm gonna at the top, go back to Alex dot com. If you guys are following along, you can just go back to Alex dot com and we're gonna go on the instructor side now. So I'm gonna click free trial again and I'm gonna do instructor and administrators again and this time I'm going to choose the instructor model. So we're gonna go into a course in Alex. It looks a little bit differently. Um I do wanna note that you don't have the ability like that to switch and Alex to like see student or teacher that way. Um I don't want them to think that they have that ability um, when they're looking at Alex and be like, why can't I see it as my student? Um You would have to impersonate your student and clever to see their Alex. True. However, you can see their course the student view course it's just not the actual student. You don't want to be logged in as the student because if you click start my path, it will log that they actually started their path when maybe they haven't worked in Alex. So this is just a generic student view. I'm gonna show you where that is on the free trial. You can't do that but you can in your instructor view. Right. Adam. Uh, I would have to go look, but I just didn't want them to think they have that. Ok. Then they should still be able to this year. I did like, they were just clicking on that outside and I was like, if they, they won't have that button when they log into Alex, like they would have to do it like what you showed them on that with the student view there or impersonate the student. Um. Right. And clever. And the nice thing about not Impersonating the student though is you're not actually logged in as the student, but you can see everything that they see in that type. Of course, if that, that would be a much better option than you're not working at the student. Ok. So you're just going to put K through 12, you put your name? Oklahoma. You don't have to put a correct email address if you don't want free emails. Ok, Christy, I got your message. Um, I'll let you back in when you come back. Ok. So I'm gonna click continue. And again, this is the, um, we're gonna start exploring, you can take a tour, but we're gonna start exploring and I'm gonna choose a course. Normally when you log into Alex and you select a course, you won't have to select a course up here. It'll take you directly to that course. But we're gonna go back into, because we're talking about AC T prep at this time. Um, we're gonna go into that mastery of AC T math if I can find it. See if I can, did I already pass it? Oh, found it. All right. This little number here tells me how many students I have in the course. This is the course I'm looking at. This is a view of the course as a whole. This is not an individual student. So my entire AC T prep has 72% complete in this AC T course. So again, this is a free trial. This is just some information um that they are kind of giving us so that we can kind of take a look if you'll notice it, gives you several reports down here at the bottom with students at the highest, you can click to the lowest pri pi progress. So these are individual student p progress here. That's what those numbers are overall grade. It can give you grades here at the bottom at time and topic report, you can click on any of these to get more information. Um, there is a second page in Alex. So I do want you to see also what that looks like there. Are several topics that your students in this course are ready to learn. 41% are ready to learn this. So these are really great things that you can pull students into a zoom and say 41%. These students are ready to learn this. So you could pull them into a zoom and you could talk to them about that standard or that topic, you could give them a little tutorial and then they could go work on it. Um, so these are just really good reports as well. Um, the student view that I was talking about earlier is right here. You go to class tools and you, you click on it here and it's under student view as a free trial instructor, you can't go from this button, but I will show you what it looks like you click on student view and you enter student view. If you'll notice it says right up here, you cannot access this with the free trial, but you would click enter student view and again, you would not be Impersonating the student. You would just be going into this course as a student to see exactly what it looks like. Exactly what type of topics they see exactly which ones have videos and which ones do not exactly what kind of, you know, how to generate a worksheet, any of that kind of stuff. You can kind of go in as a student and take a look. So to get back where I was. You're gonna click on this waffle over here on the left hand side that gives you all the little tabs that we were just looking at all those little reports and you can click right back there. I'm gonna look at all the things that I was going to cover for this. Ok, student view. So topic goal is next when using AC T prep or any course, it doesn't matter. The students really need to understand exactly what it is they need to complete. Because when you log into Alex, you can just start working and you don't really know exactly what you need to be doing or how much of it or when it's due or any of that. So to make AC T prep really, really easy, we have done 10 topics per week for roughly 22 weeks. We are keeping that same requirement this year. It's just a different course. So if you add those up, that's about 220 topics, right, roughly throughout the year. So when we talk about that, that is not going to be the 500 topics that are in the course like that. Remember we saw they had 500 topics left, so they won't necessarily complete this mastery of AC T math course. That's ok. We just want the, the topics complete. So under um, assignments you're going to assign a topic goal. So we want them to have 10 topics per week. So they see on their side exactly what they need to complete by the end of the week. So we're gonna go to assignments and we're gonna assign a topic goal. So if you'll notice, you will only see, because you haven't assigned anything on your end, you will only see this initial knowledge check. That will give them, that is automatic. Everybody will see that and then you won't see anything else below here. You'll just see this initial knowledge check. So you're gonna go a new assignment and these are step by step in the um quick start guide. So you guys will have these steps step by step on epic one and, and you can readdress them. So we're gonna go to topic goal time is not great in Alex. I'm gonna tell you right now. They can sit for 30 minutes in Alex and just log time. They don't have to actually complete anything. So that's why topic goal is better. So we're gonna go into topic goal. I'm gonna make this a reoccurring topic goal and I'm gonna make it through the end of first semester just so we make sure and get everything that we need um throughout this. So I'm gonna call this a weekly topic goal and it's gonna show in your grade book, which is awesome because the students will know they need to do 10 every week. You will have a grade for how many they did out of that 10 every week, you can easily enter that into the grade book and be done. So this is gonna repeat weekly. We are going to, I always did my grades on Fridays or completion on Fridays. You can do Sunday, you can do Friday, you can do whatever you want to. So I want by Friday for them to have 10 topics complete. I'm gonna start this on the first day of school. You can start at the second week of school if you want to. After you've addressed that, um, you can change the time, whatever you wanna do and then you're gonna say it ends after I'm gonna say 11 weeks, you can take it all the way to December, you can start it at a later time. Um, whatever you wanna do, you're gonna count the number of weeks that they're going to work in first semester. Um, remember it is just one course this year. So they will be able to continue in, um, into that next. You just want that 22 weeks, 10 topics per week. Um, topics learned. We wanna say 10 if you're using it as a supplement for AC T prep. So this is all I'm using it for now and then I am going to award partial credit. That means if they get 10, then they get 100. If they did nine, they get 90 but we don't wanna give all or nothing because that means if they did nine, they get a zero because they didn't match the 10. So we do wanna give partial partial credit and then we're gonna click save. So that gives me an assignment, a weekly topic goal that will now show in the grade book. So when you go to grade book, we're going to click grade book up here. And I do want to take a look at grade book set up before we talk about um the gray back. So if you'll notice they have default percentages, if you are just using this as AC T prep and you are just using the topic goal, then you are only gonna want to put 100% in the topic. We're not going to do any percentage on pie progress or time. If you're using this as a course, obviously, you can use tests and quizzes and homework as different percentages. So this is the grade book set up that you wanna make sure that you have the correct percentage. If you are not using um the pie progress or the time, then you don't need to have any percentages there. So to look at the grade book, we're just gonna go to class grade book here at the top. Again, it will assign to the whole class liberty. It will assign to the whole class. You do not need to set this up individually um for individual students, it will set up your whole grade book all Right. So this, because it's a trial looks a little bit different. But if you'll notice this topic, week one and then topic week two. So this is the grade, the, the topic goal grade that we set. So it shows you what your students got. So this one, this student only did 40% 42% of the, um, 10 topics that we assigned. So let's say they did four and then they started 1/5 1. Well, when they started that fifth one, they got about 2% done. So they get partial credit for that, which is really nice. So we wanna make sure that, that set up these students did all 10 topics. So they got 100% and this is the grade you will enter for AC T prep. So again, it goes topic week one, topic, week two, you will only see topic week three all the way as many topics as you put for there. So if it's for ac T prep only we need to change the setup for topic goals to 100% or did I misunderstand that you would Susan, you would set up the topic goal for 1010 topics per week and that's where that 100% got, um, comes from. This, calculates it as a percent. I mean, Alex does that for you. So it would give you 10 out of 10, 8 out of 10, whatever that is. Does that make sense? Did I answer that question. All right. So the other thing I'm gonna talk about, I'm gonna go back to my, um, set up here. So this gives you step by step on setting a topic goal and a report that you can take a look at the grades are here. This is in the AC T prep, um Epic use. So I just pulled it over here. Um, so this is what I said for semester one. So I will tell you I changed this a little bit from last year. This is in the AC T prep Epic one. But I said 81 to 100 and 10 topics is an A and the reason I said this is for semester one and the reason I said so few at 81 is because remember every 20 topics and five hours they do receive that knowledge check, which is about 45 minutes to an hour. So I tried to give them a little bit and they should in 100 and 10 topics receive like 4 to 5 of those knowledge checks. So I wanted to give them time um based on those knowledge checks like credit for doing some of those if that makes sense. So I that's why I did a range of 80 to 100 and 10 for an A in the grade book. And then this would be your final grade for AC T prep. So that's what I changed a little bit. This year, I did want to give them a little bit of credit for taking those knowledge checks during that time, topics do count towards their pie. Yes. So when they are working on those topics, they learn them, they don't get credit for them unless they've actually learned them within that week. So 10 topics learned in a week, meaning they answered the questions correctly and that goes into their pie. That's what they're working on is their pie. Great question. So this is what that would look like for an a for second semester, 100 and 62 to 220 topics. Again, I tried to give them some credit for taking those knowledge checks every five hours and every 20 topics. Ok? Any questions on AC T requirements or anything that we just looked at in the instructor view. So we went through all of these things for the basic training. So we'll go into using Alex Moore as a core in the next 2030 minutes. So any questions on those, I'm gonna wait for that to come through in the chat and see if you guys have any questions and we're gonna stay in as the instructor and kind of go over some more information as the instructor as I'm waiting for those questions to come through. I do wanna say if you are using Alex as a core, you kind of need to know what you're doing in Alex. It is not a plug and play curriculum. It is not something that you can just put them in and let them work and just take a grade on. It is considered a supplement. So if you are going to use it as a core, you need to set objectives, assign assignments and be conscious of what they are working on within Alex. So that is very important. We kind of went through this, it was a new program last year and we kind of just said, get him in there working in their path, um, and see how it goes. And we kind of realized that you need to know a lot more about exactly what they're covering standard wise and make sure that they're completing those standards within Oklahoma. Can they make? Oh, Reagan, this is a really good question. Excuse me? Can they make up questions from the week before to catch up? They can't in the Alex grade book and let me tell you why the topic goal is for that week and that week only it will close at the end of the week. But let's say a student did eight topics out of 10. So they get an 80 but they feel terrible and they really wanna make that up. They can do 12 topic the next week and you can adjust the grade book, Alex will not adjust on its own that, that student did two more topics the next week. And so it goes through the last week, but you can make that adjustment on your own. In Alex, you can change the grade in Alex or you can just change the grade in Power School. That makes makes sense if a student does 91 week and 11 the next week. Yes, page. Same thing. You can adjust that in the Alex grade book. So on the week they did 12, you can go back to that 80% and you can give them 100% change that 80 to 100% the week before or again, you can just change it in Power School. Really? The grade book and Alex is not the one ones following. It's the one in Power School for AC T prep. So that's the one you want to have accurate, but that's just gonna be teacher discretion. Alex doesn't do that for them, but you can speak to the student and say work ahead two topics this week and I'll give you credit for the week before if that makes sense. Ok? So I'm gonna move into Alex as a core. So I'm gonna go up to up here and I'm gonna go into, let's say we're gonna go into I'm gonna go into a middle school course. So I'm gonna go back and I'll show you what that looks like. I'm gonna go up here if you're following along with me, I'm gonna go right here. No, not to that one. Let me see where that was middle school here it is middle school math course one. That's the sixth grade math. If you'll notice that says level six, that is the sixth grade math course. So that's what I'm gonna go into because I'm gonna talk about using this for my sixth grade math student. So, one of the things I want to talk about is you kind of need to know. I'm gonna click my waffle over here and go back to the tab that homepage. I'm in the grade book now, I'm gonna go back to the home page. There you go. And I'm gonna take a look at my slides real quick. I'll send you these slides. I meant to do that at the beginning and I did not do that, but you kind of need to know what your student. Sixth grade students need to cover within your math curriculum for sixth grade. It's really important that you go to these Oklahoma frameworks. We just did a professional development. Some of the coaches did something on following the frame frameworks. These are really important to get to know exactly what the progression level of 1/6 grade math student is. Um So I'm gonna click on this and take you to it. I'm gonna put this in the chat real quick if you guys wanna follow the framework as well. If you've never seen these, be sure and save this link, bookmark it to your computer and take a look at these perfect when things are loaded to have Alex. Um So we're gonna go into math, click down here and then I'm gonna go to the sixth grade framework for math and then I'm going to go to the suggested learning progression in um for our state's objectives here. OK? Our standards. So in unit one, it tells me exactly. Sorry unit zero is just kind of like a review, growth mindset and problem solving skills things here. But it will tell you what standards are covered in this first unit, what should be covered first within this unit here. So that's what we're going to take a look at and we're gonna kind of follow when creating objectives in Alex. So I'm gonna go over here to force administration and I'm gonna set the objectives for the sixth grade math class based on um the order I want them to see it. If I don't set objectives, they're just gonna be in their path and they can work on several different things that can be very random. Um They can kind of flip flop, that's OK. But in order to make assignments, we kind of need to know what they're working on when so that we can make an assignment. So setting the objectives is really nice because then you can just make an assignment over those objectives that we just did or they just covered. Sorry. Um I'm gonna go into class summary class administration and then class summary again, these steps are in the Epic U and on Epic one as well. So first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to go to um I'm gonna set this content customization. I think hang on. I may have to click around for a second. I get them confused when I'm doing content editor. Yes. OK. So I'm going to set um they changed it from objectives to modules. Let's see. So this is gonna give me a set module of things that we can cover. So if you'll notice unit one is area and surface area, so this gives me what Alex suggests, the progression order for them to be. Um So it will tell you how many topics that is, you can move those around. So that's what I'm talking about. You can set these as is or you can take a look at the Oklahoma framework and kind of move these around based on what the Oklahoma framework is. Um So if you'll notice introducing ratios, if the Oklahoma framework has that come before um c area and surface area, you can kind of move these around. So we're gonna move this to the top, you'll notice that, move that up. Oh, we can't easily do that because it has due dates. Hang on. Yeah. Unify. Is that moving it? 123? Yes. Unit five moved up. But let's see if we can move unit three yet. OK. So then we moved to the unit three above that one, that one is moving. I don't know why that date. It's because the date changed. So we need to move the dates differently so we can change the dates there. So unit one, if you'll notice the dates are here that will close. So the students need to be able to finish that topic within that date range. And if they don't, it will close and you will have to make those adjustments there. That makes sense. So this is by date, but you can also do it by percentage. Let me see where that is without due dates, switch modules without due dates. So we're gonna click here and then it will say so they are gonna work on unit one until they hit 90%. You can change that percentage to 80% and then they will not have the next unit unlocked until they've hit that 80% no matter the due date. Does that make sense? So you can do it by percentages or you can do it by due date? If you do it with dates, it's the whole class and it closes after that date. If you do it by percentages, each individual student will have to hit a certain percentage before they move on. So it's more individualized that way. Ok, I'm gonna pause for questions on objectives. Sorry, you would scroll down here and click continue and then that will give you information. About what's inside the module. I would recommend 80%. Yes, rather than 90% depends on the students, but I would recommend 80%. So this is asking, do you want all of these topics um selected under this? So select below to see more, you can take out topics or you can rearrange topics within that unit as well. And then I'm also gonna show you how you can add topics as well in an editor. So you can take things out and you can edit them as well. So the reason I'm showing, showing you these topics in an order like a framework order based on Oklahoma standards is because now I can go in and I can go back to assignments. I'm gonna scroll up here. I'm gonna go back to assignments and I'm gonna assign a quiz. Sorry, I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna assign a quiz based on that unit that I just gave. So I can assign a homework over ratios. I can assign a quiz over surface area. I can assign a test over those things. So that's why setting the objectives is really important because you know exactly what they're working on. If you just have students working in their path, you kind of have to dig to see what they last worked on in order to assign something. Does that make sense to everybody? Ok. So under assignments, I'm just gonna click assignments again. This is just like the topic goal and I would probably even, um, as a core have a topic, goal of how many you wanted them to complete per week. I would take a look at several things. How many topics are in the course, divide that out over two semesters. I would also take a look at, um, if you need to add extra assignments or extra quizzes, I would take that into account of the topics per week because your assignments and quizzes are going to be on top of the topics. So I would definitely have more than 10 if you're using it as a core, but it depends on the course and the grade level on how many you would assign per week. Um ok, so from there you would go to new assignment and we're gonna assign, let's say a homework, we're gonna practice some of those ratios that we just did. So here you can do Alex topics or you can do Oklahoma standards because it's a free trial. I can't show you the Oklahoma standards, but it is in there. You can have the due dates for the assignment. You can have it all week long and close on a Friday or you can have it just a single day. You can go to um any previous assignments or they, they just have Alex topics. But th this is where you would choose standards for Oklahoma standards. All of the Alex courses are aligned to Oklahoma standards. So you do have that option. And then I'm gonna go into see it says the unit now that you have the objective set, so it has the unit that you're looking at of what you want to assign and I forgot which one it was. Let's just do surface area. We're gonna do um five questions in surface area. Here is an easy ad. So now you've got a homework assignment of five questions. That's super easy. Now, if you want to get more um in depth, I'm gonna go to surface area. Again, you can go into specific questions and you can add that one, so I can add that question over here. So this is individual exact questions that you want to add or you can easily just add those five questions. So this is gonna be a homework assignment based on the units that you just put in order. Does that make sense to everybody? So again, if you're using Alex as a core, it does take a little bit more effort and you do kind of need to know what you're doing. I am happy to meet with you guys and help you set up your course, but it does need to be much more involved than just the AC T prep supplement of just letting them work in their, in their core. The last thing I'm gonna do um on actually doing the course um using it as a course. I'm gonna go back to class administrator and go to class summary. So I am gonna show you the third grade level courses, fourth grade level courses does not have very many topics. They do not at all. So I would suggest adding more content to the course rather than letting them finish that and move up to a grade level. Ok? So we're gonna go to class summary again and again, all of these steps are on the quick start guide, easy for you to get there, step by step. Um bullet points. Um You don't have to remember all this. But if you wanted to, we went to class administration and then class summary and you're going to um module I it's cut where hang on, hang on. Let me find it. I don't know that it's in here. It's under class content and then I think it says content editor. Let me see if the module will it? Yes, the um Alex Epic one page has the quick start guide on there. I think it's called like Best Practices Q and A. Yeah, I don't think in the OK. I don't think in the free trial I can edit. It says under class content. It says content editor. Oh, I'm sorry. One second, let me my husband let my dog in. I need to let it out. Otherwise you would start hearing the dog barking to get out. Um So normally there is a content edit editor which means it tells you this class content has 374 topics and you can add in more topics. The cool thing about this when you add in topics and it's really just following prompts. I think you guys will be fine. But the cool thing about this is it will also, um, tell you that you added that topic, but this is a prerequisite to that topic. Do you also want to add this one? So it will tell you anything that student needs to know before the topic you added and it will give you that prompt of. Do you wanna, are you sure you don't wanna add this one? It's a prerequisite to something that you added. So it's really nice. Ok, I am going to pause and see if I went through, let me see if I went through objectives, assignments, content editor and then reports. So I will go into reports, um, good reports within Alex and I'm gonna pause real quick for any questions in the chat as I'm doing that. So as you guys are typing, typing those questions, I'm gonna go back to that home page right here with that little waffle to take me to all that stuff. Just so I could kind of see all of this. The reports are right here in some of these tabs, but there's a little bit more in depth than just those. So if you'll click on reports, if you'll notice several things pop up, so I'm gonna talk, um talk about three different reports and I can go quickly if you have to pop out. This is recorded. So I will send this recording out as well. Um If you'll notice that's a good question. Autumn, I'm not sure about that. So hang on, let me address before autumn. Addresses that it says can a student be in more than one class? Meaning can they take geometry and algebra one together? I will tell you that Alex courses are not split into semesters. So if the student wants to take algebra one B, keep in mind that they must test out of all of that content for algebra one A because it's a single course. Algebra is a bad example because I think there is an algebra one B course but like geometry is a full course semester, it's not semester A and B sorry, you long course. So they would have to test out of all of those objectives. So teachers that come to me and say I just need them to be an AL or geometry B I say to them, Alex may not be a good fit unless you think they can test out of all of those objectives for geometry A. Does that make sense? Page algebra two is the same way and then I'm not sure if they can be in two courses. Um So no, I don't think there's a way for us to load two courses um at the same time because it will only you're purchasing one license and it's loaded for that license um from Spin Bridge. So you like, you can't, they can complete one course and then you can load them in a new course. Um And you know, they can take several courses just not simultaneously. Um It would be consecutively just like math. Um So it, I mean, that's kind of how Alex put it to us anyway, Like why would you want them to take them simultaneously? Uh Because that isn't how you learn math anyway. So that, I mean, so we don't load them like that. Um So and the answer, one of the answers to that would be you could put one in Apex and then put the other course in Alex. Um I get real sticky as a math teacher of why would you want them working in two math courses at the same time? Unless it's something like credit recovery like you're saying, but if it's two courses full year, I wouldn't do it at the same time. I would have them complete one. And then Haley, I don't know, like you said, the algebra one A and B but I don't, we don't have it loading like that. It's loading full year for all of them. OK. Um I think all of the Alex courses load full year and page. I see it says uh your student is a senior and doesn't want to graduate this year. Um, I totally get that. I would just encourage them to complete one of the courses first and then move to the next course, like sort of in block scheduling type thing. Um, or like you said, we could do one in Alex and one in Apex or something. Um, credit use this as credit recovery. Christy. I probably need to check on the requirements for credit recovery. I'm not real sure there. Um, and it's, I do wanna address the Fed um, situation too because I want to talk about some of the RT I courses. So I'm gonna quickly do that. So the some of the reports that we're talking about the time and topic report is really good because we're following the topics. Remember. So there's a, a time and topic report that's really good. The progress report tells them all of their progress within Alex. Um, this is the standards report and you can pull the Oklahoma standards that they've covered this one can get very confusing. I'm gonna go ahead and click on it. Um, a lot of people had some trouble with it last year. Um, because we were taking a look at, they had not completed, they had not mastered very many topics or excuse me, very many Oklahoma standards. However, that doesn't mean that they didn't see the standards. It's just that me, it just meant that they haven't completed the entire standard. So some of these are real like some of these numbers in the beginning are really low, but that doesn't mean they haven't seen several topics within that standard. They just haven't mastered the entire standard. Um, so it's like when they're working in progress, they've seen 42% of the standard, but they just haven't mastered the entire thing if that makes sense. Um, you can pull this as an individual student, a student right down or you can switch to your classroom. So this would be classroom right now, 42% of your class has worked in that standard. Um So you can do those either way. So it will pull the Oklahoma standards and what, what they have completed at 100% your entire class or what who is progressing? You can click on any of these percentages and it will take you to the exact students that are working on that and which ones have mastered and which ones have not. Um So you can click into any of those. This TD means that that standard is not in Alex and you um need, it's teacher directed is what that means. You need to make sure that they, the students see that standard. In another aspect, there's not very many of those um within Alex, but there are a few usually, I think within middle school, there's like maybe two or three standards, not very many. Um and you can pull those reports on Alex dot com as well. So the standards report is really good. Again, the time and topic report is really good. It will tell you exact exactly how much time they've spent during the week. If you this, I don't love this table. But, um, right here or graph, but you can take a look down here. It tells you the number of minutes they've spent each day and it will give you a little flag if it says something, um, or what, sorry, that flag is the knowledge check, but it will also give you like a little yellow flag if they're like, maybe they attempted 15 topics and learn zero. Like that's a yellow flag. Um So if you'll notice this three out of three means that they spent 25 minutes and they entered three topics and learned all three. So that's really great. If you'll notice this three out of four, that means they entered four topics, but they learned three of them and one they did not learn. So time and topic report is really great for individual students to see exactly for the week how much they've done in a small amount of time and time frame. This will tell you the total time they've spent in Alex and the total number of topics that they have completed. So any questions from those, the progress report is really good too. I'm not sure how that's gonna look this year compared to last year. So I'm a little hesitant on that one. we pulled detailed progress history last year and it told us everything that the student had done within Alex. So that was a really good report last year that we pulled. Um, if you click on all progress, it will tell you for that student, all the progress that they've done since the first day they were in Alex. Um I think this will still be a good report. This dark blue portion here tells me what they knew on the knowledge check and then the lighter blue is how much they've learned since the last knowledge check. This also tells me that they've worked on 23 topics since their knowledge check. So they actually worked on topics not tested out of in a knowledge check. So here again, the knowledge check, they were, they were given another knowledge check and they scored at 36% and they've worked on 6% since then. And that's 23 topics. They were given another progress, knowledge check on 512, they learned 41% of the, um, topics on the knowledge check. And since then they've worked on 1% or five topics. Um, the I'm gonna show you where here, let me show you real quick on our IC page. So this is epic one on our IC page. There's a professional development library. It's right here. This is the instructional coach page under pages. You'll go to instructional coaches and then if you'll click professional development these recordings are all down here and we are putting them in ELC this year so that if your MD I or principal is tracking PD hours, they will be trackable within ELC. So you can click on any of these and get any recordings here. This, that's the summer PD. Yes. And then if you'll notice Freckle is in here, all of the vendor trainings that have been here and I will add this as soon as this recording is done here. Um Last but not least I want to address the RT I um and other courses within Alex. Again, if you are using Alex as a core, you need to know what you're doing and you really need to attend trainings or come and meet with me so we can set up your course so that we know um what exactly what the students are working on. There are RT I courses in Alex or um like prerequisite courses that let's say a student scored on the initial knowledge check below 10%. You would move them into a course below level and then they would work in that course. But keep in mind that course is really small. It's not the course they're supposed to be in. It's a prerequisite course that you want them to move through quickly and then you would bump them back up to their regular course. It is not a course that they would do instead of you really want them moving through those, um, topics as quickly as possible because they only like roughly like 100 topics. Um, and then you're gonna move them back up to their grade level course. So that is when you go into courses, that is what a lot of these RT I 67 and eight courses are. And I can do like a Fed training because I have prerequisite courses for certain levels that we can kind of go further into. If you have questions about that, we can go into those. But like I said, um, these, let's see how many topics this has. This is RT I six, which would mean it would probably be a third through fifth grade topics um that they would be in and they would master before moving up to 1/6 grade math course. Um But if you'll notice, let's see how many topics are in this course. So there's only 100 and 84 topics in this course. So this would not be a full year course. This would be like a few weeks or a few months and then you would move them back up to grade level after they finish some of these prerequisite scores. Ok. So that's all I have for now, I think. And I'm gonna move to my last slide. Um ok, so that's all I have for now, I'm gonna pause for questions, feel free to unmute. I'm gonna leave the recording going in case we have some really great questions that we want to make sure they're on there. If you don't mind, I would love for you to fill out a survey and let me know what else you would like to see in a training so we can continue these trainings and we can go into more in depth on certain areas. Um The title of this PD was the Alex teacher training and my name is Hayley Bradley again, one of the instructional coaches here at Epic Christy. That's a great question. I do not feel comfortable answering questions like that because I don't know as far as RT I requirements. Um and what that department is requiring as far as success maker. So that is something we would have to check in with RT I and check with them about. Can we create a um course or a group that would help, you know, remediate a specific skill or set of skills for a group of students? So you could assign a specific topic to a student. Is that what you mean? So let's say you had. So a lot of the reports um that we talked about. So let me go into this second page. So, um attempted but did not learn or lost in recent assessment. These give you topics and what students you can click on these and I'll tell you what students, so it will kind of group on your own, what students are working on like which topics they are struggling in or what topics they are doing well in and you can kind of group students that way and then you can assign a specific topic to a student. Yes. Did that answer that question? Angie. I was thinking of like IEP students that I had and you know, that if I wanted to track, um, certain IEP goals or things that came out in star, um, but that would still work to do assignments that way so that I could and progress monitor those things. Yes. Um, there is a really great report too and I don't see it on here. There's an IEP report. It's probably because this is the free trial, but that is a really good report within Alex as well. That tells you a little bit more in depth about what students are covering, um, and how to adjust or where to take their students. Um, we can go more in depth as well on, um, how to move certain students into that RT I course, but not all of your students as well. You can create a subclass and move them into an RT I course and have them working in that course and then when they finish, move them back up to grade level, that's a little bit more in depth like a sped training, um, that you would have working students working in a certain course and moving them back up because you don't want to move the whole class, you may not have all your students at that same level. But if anyone scores below 10% on their initial knowledge, check, Alex does suggest that they will not do well in that course. And they need to be moved to a lower level course and then move back up once they have completed those prerequisites. If that makes sense. Yes. Is it similar to like the sub course that we did last year for the, if you wanted to combine, do a combined AC T algebra for the freshman, it's exactly the same. You would just move into that RT I course. And I actually have, I think it's on the AC T prep. Um You know what, I, I probably just need to send it out the um progression of Alex courses. So like if they score below 10% in seventh grade, they need to be moved to RT I six and then move back up to seventh grade. Um I'm sorry, RT I seven and then move back up. So that RT I seven is gonna be like six and seven or excuse me, 5th and 6th grade math topics that they would complete and then they'd be moved back up to seventh grade if that makes sense. So they're just missing a lot of those prerequisites and that's talking about where they need to be moved. But again, that is like a couple of months, not a full year course to leave them in RT. I, even if they're fed, we really need them moved into grade level topic material. Um As soon as they complete this. That sounds awesome. I really am interested in. I want to know more about that. Perfect. I think I'm gonna go ahead and put together an, an Alex Fed training with that progression chart and kind of talk about that information RT I and sped courses and we can talk a little bit about that again if you're using it, Susan says yes, please. Um If you're using it as a core, I just strongly suggest that you really get in and know a lot about Alex because it, the path is just not enough. We learned that last year students were getting through really quickly on some courses and we just wanna make sure that they're covering all the standards that we want them to cover and they're getting assignments and homework and quizzes what they would get in a regular core. Yeah, I will definitely do that guys for sure. All right, I'm gonna stick around for any questions, but I wanted to let you guys go if you um if you wanna hop out. Um But I will stick around if anybody else has more questions, I'd be happy to answer.\"), (180, 602, 3790, \"Welcome to the 2223 Mac plus framework Math Plus is a program offering live or unplugged online math instruction through a certified math instructor in live sessions. Students will be required to attend +21 hour and 15 minute classes twice a week. On either Monday, Wednesday or Tuesday, Thursday. In unplugged sections, students will complete their curriculum completely online but will attend zoom meetings for Proctor major assessments like unit tests. Alex's initial knowledge check as well as semester finals in both models. Students are expected to keep the pace set by the instructor and meet assignment deadlines for the 2223 school year. We are offering courses to students. Fifth through 12th grade classes include fifth through eighth grade level math algebra one, geometry, algebra two and precalculus grades are entered by Math plus instructors in the courses built in school and will automatically sync to power. School. Parents will be provided a weekly email including attendance data and a detailed assignment report to keep track of progress, attendance grades and missing assignments. This information can be viewed on your teacher or principal Math plus dashboard. Our grade level teams offer multiple office hours that both live and unplugged students may attend as well as assigned targeted tutoring for students identified as needing more help. Students can check their school courses for the specific available times for their grade level. Starting in January 2023. Math plus instructors will not be emailing the weekly grade update to roster teachers. This email will only go to the student and guardians. We did this to limit the abundance of emails that roster teachers receive and to protect your valuable time. You can access all of the information sent in the emails from your math plus teacher or principal dashboard. If you receive an email from a math plus instructor, it is important and most likely needs you to step in and help with some sort of action. Preliminary state test data suggests that the 2122 math plus students outperform the state's average in 2019 and 2021 good candidates for math plus include students who participate in on grade level content with typical peers. Please remember that the pace is set by the math plus instructor and all direct instruction is on grade level. Our office hours are available for students who may need more help but the content will continue to move each week. Students with an IEP that require modifications of assignments or assessments are not good candidates for math plus. At this time, state test codes that we can meet are listed on the slide. We are able to extend time and give tests individually in breakout rooms to meet the S one and S four requirements. S five and S six will be dependent upon the special education teacher and parent having those resources available in the home. Other accommodations we can provide as necessary are written transcripts of the videos, close captions on the videos and PDF S of the slides from videos to students and roster teachers. However, we are not able to provide text to speech across all activities. Students and families may use third party applications for those accommodations if the IEP team is comfortable with them and when our programs do not provide them assistive technology is parent and sped teacher based. If it is provided in the home, then we will allow it a few things we cannot accommodate. Are braille a sl interpreter, individualized instruction, service, human reader or scribe. If you're unsure if math plus would be a good fit for a student, please reach out to the Math plus director or one of the instructors for the for any questions during the school year. About specific students who are participating, please reach out to the students. Math instructor instructional accommodation should not be an issue to support. In most cases. If you feel there might be a special case, please reach out directly to that student's math plus instructor. If direct instruction is listed as a service on the ie, our classes do not meet those stipulations at this time because our teachers are not fed certified. Our highest priority this year is to have a copy every student's IE or 504 accommodations in our math plus instructors hands so that we can meet compliance for each student. We feel the best way to serve all of our students is to know our students and their needs. Math plus uses weighted grading which will vary by course. You can find the graded breakdown listed in each course syllabus shown on our website. All grades will come from the math plus instructor. They will not add or change grades based on work or extra credit given by the student roster. Teacher, math plus is a complete curriculum with test prep embedded throughout the year. All math plus students are exempt from epic essential programs or attending A T I math tutoring sessions. Please do not require either of these programs from your students as the math plus course is very rigorous and we don't want to overwhelm them with any additional work. They won't be receiving credit for the only time a student would be required to complete these programs is if they are not completing their math plus and Alex lessons with fidelity. A math plus instructor may also assign an ET I session to a student if they see the student needs extra help in a particular area new and starting this semester is our Math Plus attendance policy. Students who accumulate four absences and are not on pace in school. And Alex will have a meeting schedule. This meeting will include the math plus instructor, student, guardians teacher and principal. At this meeting, everyone will discuss a probationary plan for the student to help with their attendance and work habits. If a student reaches six absences and isn't on pace in school. J Alex, then the student will be withdrawn from Math plus and returned to their core. The math instructor has final decision making over special circumstances that may warrant avoiding withdrawal. Also starting new this spring is our work policy at any point in the semester. If a student is behind pace by 50% or more for two consecutive weeks. A probationary meeting will be scheduled. This meeting will include the student guardians, math instructor roster, teacher and principal. There will be two options at this meeting. Option. One is a probationary work plan. All the stakeholders will discuss actual quantifiable actions that will need to take place for the student to improve work behaviors and all parties would have to agree to the plan. Option two. If a work plan is not put in place or the stakeholders believe it would not be beneficial to the student, then the stakeholders can decide to withdraw from plus at that point. If a probationary plan is put in place, the student will have two weeks to get previous work completed. If the student does not put in a significant effort to get caught back up or continues to fall further behind. The student will be withdrawn at the end of the two week probationary period. The math plus instructor has full discretion to not withdraw a student. If a special case can be made, we recognize that math plus is not the best fit for all students and that some students may want to withdraw from math plus. Turn to their core. Please have a discussion with the math instructor to see if there's anything that can be done to help the student become successful before submitting a drop ticket. We hate to see students leave when an easy accommodation could have been made to help them find success if a student and family ultimately decides that math plus is no longer a good fit for them. A fresh service ticket must be submitted. This can be done by teacher or principal. However, teachers must get principal approval before submitting all semester. Two students will have a deadline of March 10th to withdraw from Math Plus drops will be processed and students will be reassigned back to their core math class, all grades earned while in Math Plus will be provided to roster teachers to assign in their core curriculum. Teachers may refer to the pacing guides to align the grades to any standards necessary. This year, we have added a Math Plus website that can be found by clicking the learning plus menu from the main Epic website. This houses our pacing guides, cabby Math plus academic calendar, instructor, bios and Fa Qs for families and faculty. We highly recommend that all principals and teachers join the Math Plus Epic one channel to view important announcements. Many important links can be found on the right side of our channel. Thank you for your support and continued effort to provide custom math instruction to the students of Epic.

Other accommodations we can provide as necessary are written transcripts of the videos, close captions on the videos and PDF S of the slides from videos to students and roster teachers. However, we are not able to provide text to speech across all activities. Students and families may use third party applications for those accommodations if the IEP team is comfortable with them and when our programs do not provide them assistive technology is parent and sped teacher based. If it is provided in the home, then we will allow it a few things we cannot accommodate. Are braille a sl interpreter, individualized instruction, service, human reader or scribe. If you're unsure if math plus would be a good fit for a student, please reach out to the Math plus director or one of the instructors for the for any questions during the school year. About specific students who are participating, please reach out to the students. Math instructor instructional accommodation should not be an issue to support. In most cases. If you feel there might be a special case, please reach out directly to that student's math plus instructor. If direct instruction is listed as a service on the ie, our classes do not meet those stipulations at this time because our teachers are not fed certified. Our highest priority this year is to have a copy every student's IE or 504 accommodations in our math plus instructors hands so that we can meet compliance for each student. We feel the best way to serve all of our students is to know our students and their needs. Math plus uses weighted grading which will vary by course. You can find the graded breakdown listed in each course syllabus shown on our website. All grades will come from the math plus instructor. They will not add or change grades based on work or extra credit given by the student roster. Teacher, math plus is a complete curriculum with test prep embedded throughout the year. All math plus students are exempt from epic essential programs or attending A T I math tutoring sessions. Please do not require either of these programs from your students as the math plus course is very rigorous and we don't want to overwhelm them with any additional work. They won't be receiving credit for the only time a student would be required to complete these programs is if they are not completing their math plus and Alex lessons with fidelity. A math plus instructor may also assign an ET I session to a student if they see the student needs extra help in a particular area new and starting this semester is our Math Plus attendance policy. Students who accumulate four absences and are not on pace in school. And Alex will have a meeting schedule. This meeting will include the math plus instructor, student, guardians teacher and principal. At this meeting, everyone will discuss a probationary plan for the student to help with their attendance and work habits. If a student reaches six absences and isn't on pace in school. J Alex, then the student will be withdrawn from Math plus and returned to their core. The math instructor has final decision making over special circumstances that may warrant avoiding withdrawal. Also starting new this spring is our work policy at any point in the semester. If a student is behind pace by 50% or more for two consecutive weeks. A probationary meeting will be scheduled. This meeting will include the student guardians, math instructor roster, teacher and principal. There will be two options at this meeting. Option. One is a probationary work plan. All the stakeholders will discuss actual quantifiable actions that will need to take place for the student to improve work behaviors and all parties would have to agree to the plan. Option two. If a work plan is not put in place or the stakeholders believe it would not be beneficial to the student, then the stakeholders can decide to withdraw from plus at that point. If a probationary plan is put in place, the student will have two weeks to get previous work completed. If the student does not put in a significant effort to get caught back up or continues to fall further behind. The student will be withdrawn at the end of the two week probationary period. The math plus instructor has full discretion to not withdraw a student. If a special case can be made, we recognize that math plus is not the best fit for all students and that some students may want to withdraw from math plus. Turn to their core. Please have a discussion with the math instructor to see if there's anything that can be done to help the student become successful before submitting a drop ticket. We hate to see students leave when an easy accommodation could have been made to help them find success if a student and family ultimately decides that math plus is no longer a good fit for them. A fresh service ticket must be submitted. This can be done by teacher or principal. However, teachers must get principal approval before submitting all semester. Two students will have a deadline of March 10th to withdraw from Math Plus drops will be processed and students will be reassigned back to their core math class, all grades earned while in Math Plus will be provided to roster teachers to assign in their core curriculum. Teachers may refer to the pacing guides to align the grades to any standards necessary. This year, we have added a Math Plus website that can be found by clicking the learning plus menu from the main Epic website. This houses our pacing guides, cabby Math plus academic calendar, instructor, bios and Fa Qs for families and faculty. We highly recommend that all principals and teachers join the Math Plus Epic one channel to view important announcements. Many important links can be found on the right side of our channel. Thank you for your support and continued effort to provide custom math instruction to the students of Epic. If you have any questions, please reach out to Erica Nielsen Haley Bradley or email Math Plus at Epic charter schools dot org.\"), (253, 554, 3600, \"Board. All righty Kelly. I threw the presentation in the chat again for you. I don't, I think you can see a little Yeah, awesome. So, first off, um while we're, while we're getting set up for the presentation, um I'm Lindsay Hedley. I'm the secondary el A instructional coach. Um We are presenting today with um our social studies instructional coach, Katie Meeks and Tara Winsett, our science instructional coach. So if you have an opportunity to uh you know, have a desktop QR code um reader, you can um out add that extension to your chromebook um and be able to easily, easily access QR codes from your computer and you can uh fill out our post presentation survey link. We will also include this information at the end of the survey as well or into the presentation. So our presentation for today is informational texts, crisscrossing the subject areas. We're going to be talking about uh different approaches for critical reading in el a social studies and science classrooms. So a good idea. Um a good structure to approach informational text is to begin with the standards, move into academic vocabulary and then um think about the instructional strategies that would best benefit your students. Um The way that this will work, um We're gonna start sort of in a general sense talking about beginning with the standards, working with the academic vocabulary. And then for each of our subject areas, we're going to showcase a different instructional strategy. So here's all of our contact information. Um Keep in mind that you can reach out to us uh for help with any kind of instructional need um through email, through fresh service on uh Epic one, you know, however, you wanna reach out and get in touch with us. You can, uh you can also attend our office hours which is available on the instructional coaches. Um Epic one page. So, um to start things off, we're beginning with talking about the Oklahoma academic standards, um we use that phrase standards based education quite often. Um But this just breaks down sort of what constitutes a standard. All right. So there are two basic components to an academic standard. You have content and practices. So content would be the, the information that your students are digesting basically, practices are what they do with that information essentially. So just keep that in mind, you have content standards and skills practices. Those two things form together to make an academic standard. All right, we've also linked in all of our standards and frameworks. Um You can see that, uh you know, they're divided up, the oas standards are linked at the top along with the frameworks, um, keep in mind for the EL A framework and the EL A standards last year we adopted a new set of standards. Um, the last time that they had been updated was in 2016. So you might see some, uh, if you're looking at an older document, you might notice that the standards look slightly different. Um, they're not hugely different but there is a little bit of, you know, well, new, new standards, you know, some standards have been broken down into smaller pieces and the science standards actually are, are just, I think in year one or two of their, their new standards so slowly but surely we, we phase out old concepts and refine what we're working with. All right. So now that we've talked about standards, let's talk about academic vocabulary. So academic vocabulary is one of those components of lesson making that it seems like a lot of people skip over. Um, you know, they feel like maybe they don't feel comfortable with their, their own vocabulary concept or they're worried that they don't have time to cover it. But if you think about it, understanding the vocabulary before you go into a lesson is key to gaining success in, in learning, you know, um if you don't know the lingo or the jargon, then chances are good that you're not going to comprehend what you're doing and then you're not going to be able to actually put into practice the knowledge that you've gained. So one thing that we're going to look at with our academic vocabulary is um first off connecting back to our previous uh our previous presentation follow the framework road. We talked a great deal about how um understanding the standards and pulling out academic vocabulary can be really, really helpful for that. So basically what you would do with this is take any kind of standard um such as with EL A uh where we talk about, for instance, um being able to summarize and we talk about the content learning that we would have with that and then the language learning. So if you think about that skills that would be like the the nouns of the standard and then language learning or actions would be the verbs of the standard. So what is the product that my students would be able to produce if they've mastered that standard? So with content learning, when we're talking about summarizing, you need to be able to read a piece and understand what the main idea is and what the supporting details are, then you have to be able to put that into your own words. Like can you produce a summary for me and explain, you know what this text is about? So just keep in mind that that is linked here as well if you want to go back to it and you can also view the recording for it in our um PD library which is available on Epic One. So next, this is just a very brief overview of some of the similarities between academic vocabulary in our three subject areas. You can see that there are some differences. So for instance, in El A, we would call uh the, the main, you know, argument of a paper or an essay, the thesis statement um in social studies, you will see that used as claim. Now there's a lot of bleed over between EL A and social studies in terms of that, you'll see a lot of um content that that uses the word claim in El A as well. But if you look directly in the standards themselves, they use thesis statement in Ela a lot more often and they use claim in social studies. So Katie and I have talked a lot about this um social studies in El A have so much in common and, and that's one of the ways that that shows really strongly is in, you know, the, the similarity between the use of thesis statement and claim um in science, a corresponding term is hypothesis. And, you know, you think about a hypothesis and how you go through the scientific method, sometimes you um you know, find that your hypothesis doesn't hold up, you know, and the same can be true for a thesis statement and a claim as well. So it's really interesting how the term is different but the the idea has a lot in common with one another. So some other ways that we can see similarities is the use of supporting details, evidence and data. Those things are all interchangeable. Um If you don't have supporting details for your thesis statement, if you don't have evidence to back up your hypothesis and your claim, then they're going to fall apart, it's going to fail. Um You can also see that there's a lot of similarities in quite a few other terms. We all use the term analyze, summarize, identify, explain and sequence. So even though we're talking about different academic subjects, a lot of the vocabulary is the same. So this makes it a lot more clear that when you know the academic vocabulary, even if you don't feel like for instance, that you're a strong science student, if you understand what they're asking you for, that increases your chances of being successful. All right. So next, just a little bit of explanation about what an informational text is. It's a subset of the larger category of nonfiction. So as an example with nonfiction, you know, that that means true, you know, not made up, but you might have um different types of nonfiction within that, you know, poetry, for instance, is considered a form of nonfiction. Um You might also have narrative nonfiction where it's basically rendered as a story. Um So as an example, um the Oklahoma based book, Killers of the Flower Moon that is narrative nonfiction. Whereas an informational text is, the purpose is not necessarily to entertain it is to inform. So it's going to be uh rendered in a much more direct manner. This makes it really, really good for, for students who are really struggling for comprehension um because it's more direct, um you also don't have that confusion that you might have with narrative nonfiction where characteristics of fiction are used to explain a real story. So a few examples of informational text, you know, could be a magazine like Newsweek um Science or history books, autobiographies, instruction manuals. Um Also what you find in, you know, encyclopedias and things like that, those would be considered informational texts additionally. And this is linked in here. Graphic organizers are a great resource for helping students understand informational texts. Once your students have gotten used to, you know, using a graphic organizer, um just in the context of work, you know, daily, um when they go into, let's say an end of year test, they can recreate a graphic organizer for themselves on their scratch paper, this increases their chances of understanding the structure used for the piece that they're reading. Um And it also means that they are going to, you know, feel comfortable like breaking that down and understanding it. So keep in mind those are really good resources to uh use on a daily basis with your students. All righty. So now we're at the point where we're talking about um strategies to engage with informational texts and these are subjects speci specific. We were going to do breakout sessions, but I think we're going to just handle this via um you know, general session. So I'm gonna turn this over to Katie at this point because we start with social studies. All right, Lindsay, do you wanna keep sharing or you wanna toss it over to me? I can toss it over to you, whichever how do you feel comfortable? Yeah, let's do that. Just so you don't have to worry about navigating for me. OK. OK. All right. Everybody see that. OK. So Lindsay mentioned when she was discussing um the standards that there are a lot of similarities between social studies and el A. So I wanted to start off just by showing you truly how similar the skill standards in particular are between the el A content area and social studies. So what you're looking at here is a, a screenshot essentially of the practice standards for social studies. And I will mention and just kind of bring up really quickly that there are actually two documents on the frameworks for social studies. They're not embedded within the same document. So when you go back to the slide that we presented to you earlier, you, you would have seen that there's a content standard button and then a button for the skills framework, the practice standards. This is from the practice standards and these often get missed. So if you take a look at these and just kind of skim through very quickly, you might notice. And we're gonna focus in grades two through eight that there's a lot of el a concepts here that are being embedded within the social studies content area. So I've just highlighted a few just for this one standard and this is just part a of the same critical reading, interpreting informational sources standard in social studies, everything that's highlighted directly supports an el A standard. So locating and paraphrasing the idea and providing supporting details, they even use the el A terminology there for you. Um Then you've got using visual information um using academic vocabulary, same thing here. This is part B of that same standard, identifying author's purpose. OK. That is very much a social studies skills standard. Because when you get into a deeper reading, critical reading of social studies text in particular primary sources, it's very important to understand the author's purpose in writing and evaluating that source for bias because that will help you make a determination about whether or not that source is in fact a reliable source for you going forward. Um So locating facts, distinguishing between fact and opinion, right, again, pointing to that bias that exists in many of our primary sources. Um and also just understanding the context in which a source is created because that's that background information is very, very important to understanding what our primary sources share with us and then of course, engaging in collaborative discussions and debates. It's very much again, historical thinking practice um that we should be using with our students. So I want to start taking, I want to see our teachers start taking social studies to the next level, right? Because it's not just a content in which we memorize names, dates and facts. All of these skills are integral to becoming a historian, right to, to engaging in historical practices and they support El A. So when you're doing these things in Ela, I want to encourage you to start using texts, informational texts that can support your social studies as well because that's a great way to be interdisciplinary and hit those two areas at once. So it's a time saver time saver ultimately. So I've highlighted just a few um instructional strategies here that help you to explore and explain informational text with your students. We're not gonna focus on the first two in depth today, but I wanted to give them to you nonetheless, because you'll probably hear some of these coming up throughout other professional developments that our coaches are putting on with you in particular. The CIN wonder that's very similar to the I notice, I wonder, right? It's just a little bit of a a different way to approach it. Um So that's a great resource all of these help our students to become more hands on with their reading, right? So Lindsay's gonna talk about annotating. Tara is gonna talk about engaging with prior knowledge prior to reading your text. These are things that you would do while you're reading through the text. The one that we're gonna focus on is the read around the text strategy. So a rat now what you're doing with your students, when you are engaging in a rat strategy is breaking down the steps of exploring the text in a very visual manner. So oftentimes we engage with texts that have uh captions and images and little pullouts and blurbs off to the side, right? Think of like uh elementary or middle school textbook. And so oftentimes our students read the main main body of the text and they leave all of that behind. But that can be a very, you know, missed opportunity for your students. Um This strategy also helps to further engage the students who are very visual because many of us are um reading uh just text on a white page, often doesn't engage many of our students. So this is a great strategy when you've got the opportunity to use a text that has some of these additional components to it. So let's just take it what makes a good rat article. So this one in particular is a great example of an article that you would use a rat strategy with. So it's got pictures or illustrations. The main article is fairly short, only about 35 paragraphs in length. It's got captions with a bunch of details and the bolder, the the vocabulary words are bolded for you. So again, an opportunity to talk about content area, vocabulary as well as potentially some academic vocabulary. OK? And I'm going through this pretty quickly because we cut the breakout sessions. So I apologize if you feel rushed. Um So I want you to just look at this one really quick based on that criteria, we just talked about illustrations captions, um bolder vocabulary, would you say yes or no? And you can just give a thumbs up, thumbs down um good or bad rat example here. Yeah. So yes, this is a beautiful uh rat example. Yes, it's black and white. That's OK. Right. Obviously, color is great because that's super engaging for our students as well. But nonetheless, this has the great the the good components of um a rat article. What about this one? Thumbs up, thumbs down, good or bad. Some of you are doing this. OK. So we're not gonna throw this article in the trash, but this is not something I would use a rat with. OK, because it doesn't have enough um photographs, it doesn't have captions, right? It doesn't necessarily have bolder vocabulary again, that doesn't mean you throw it in the trash. Just don't do a rat with this one, right? There's not gonna be enough for your students to engage with when completing the actual activity and I'll show you what that looks like here in just a second. OK. Last example here. Good, maybe bad. I would say that this is a good one. OK? You've got lots of illustrations, you've got captions. This is actually from a textbook that I used with my students when I taught in Virginia, when I was teaching sixth grade social studies. Um One of the reasons that this textbook was adopted was because of all of the images and all of the different pull out information off to the side, which often incorporated the elements of the, the practice standards that we were using. So if you look down to that one corner where it says eyewitness to history, you've actually got a quote from a primary source document. So again, engaging students beyond just the secondary, the secondary text um and, and putting them in uh and engaging with um the words of witnesses to the history. OK. All right. So let's again, talk about why you might want to do this with your students. So what skills are you addressing when you're participating in a rat activity using a graphic organizer like this one. Now, this is one that I drew up, but really, you can organize it any way that you want as long as you're asking your students to evaluate these different pieces of information. Well, first and foremost, using this activity can help you to identify and classify the text as informational, right? And I know that, that's a skill that you would hit in el A is classifying different texts into their genres and their types. Um Next, it helps the students to identify topic, sentences within the informational text, determine the main idea and then sup support, uh identify any supporting information for those, for those areas. Um Also can help them to create a title that reflect on that main idea. OK. So I was gonna have my breakout session go through and actually complete the rat um with this particular piece of uh this, this article, but I don't want to run over our time. So I'm just gonna go ahead and show you what the graphic organizer looks looks like. And um we can move on to our next strategy. So again, up here, students identified the article title. First thing that they can do is look at the pictures again, often they just jump right into the text because they want to get it done, right? But I often encourage my students to look at the pictures first because for those students in particular that struggle in reading, that's an engagement piece, right? It can get them thinking, get them wandering, right? Which again is another strategy altogether. But those images are the engagement piece. OK. So I often pointed them to those images first, then to the captions that went with them, then to any match charts or graphs that might exist. OK. So in particular, like if we were doing this uh article that I just showed you right. There are no graphs or anything like that. So you can just tell your students to skip that or you can provide a supplement to go with it whatever you'd like to do. Um But there is a space there. This also might be an opportunity where you would want to modify the rat organizer and make your own and just take that piece out if they don't exist in your article. Um then they can look at the titles and the headings. It's important to do that before engaging with the text too so that students know what they're gonna be reading for. Um In the case of this particular text, I loved that they gave like really kind of witty and engaging titles for their subsection. So sweet and sour. Like what does that mean? Right. And it kind of just gets them curious. So it's a curiosity thing there. Um Then they can go through and start reading, right? And while they're doing that, they should be highlighting, engaging Lindsay, gonna talk about annotating and what that looks like. Um And how you can do that with your students, but then I can come back and summarize bits and pieces of it. Um And then as you can see here, this box here, what's the purpose of the article? So again, identifying that this is an informational text talking about the author's purpose in el A and a social studies skill. And then at the end, what have you learned from this piece? OK. So they might be coming to you with a fair bit of background knowledge and you might engage in a strategy like what Tara is gonna show you here in just a moment before you even get to this activity. Um But this gives them an opportunity to just kind of jot down a few ideas that they picked up while you were going through the text. OK? Oh, I'm gonna stop sharing. And again, I apologize if that was really quick. We were planning to do breakout sessions and would have had a little bit more time. But um Terry, you wanna go ahead and take it away? Yes, I will. I apologize for my voice and if I cough, I've got a lovely cold going on. So um I only feel like I've been run over by my truck, so I'm doing great. Um I'm gonna share my screen with you. Hopefully you are seeing science break out. Let me move my controls here. Thank you, Lindsay. Um So we're kind of just doing the same thing showing you how we can cross across different subject areas. So, on this first one, this is what your science practice standards look like. We actually have three dimensions to our standards, the science and engineering practice, the disciplinary core idea and then the cross cutting concept. But what we can look at is where we relate this to el A. It's kind of almost exactly the same as what Katie did with social studies is the standards, reading and writing process, um critical reading and writing vocabulary, we even have research and then multimodal liter literacies. So what we look like, what that would look like in this bottom standard, obtaining evaluating and communicating information. But we use the information from books and or other reliable sources to explain phenomena or solutions to a design problem. We can look at that on another um standard here where we pull in even more. Um Just, just a second. There we go engaging in arguments from evidence. So support an argument with evidence data or a model. Um This would go with standard six and el A research um can be compared here with our science. Standard two strategies that uh I was gonna talk about here for engaging with informational text. We know we want to engage our students in science and a lot of times that's hands on or however we can get, get that to happen for us. So this one to access prior knowledge and we always build on what we learn in science. So if you've learned the three parts of the atom later, you're gonna learn how do those function together and so forth. So these uh two pieces give you a way to reflect on that prior knowledge and then engage it in an activity that helps them connect it to past and present experiences. So it makes it easier to determine students prior knowledge, using graphic organizers like a defining chart or a no want to know learned uh graphic organizer. So just real quick um and let me do, I'll show you this too. These are linked here. So when you open your presentation, if you do want a link to one of these, you can click on either one. So a defining chart. Sorry, let me get my voice back here. Um A defining chart uh it says while working with partners or in a small group, obviously, our model usually you don't have small groups, but if you happen to be meeting in person or even just together on zoom like we are here, um Students explore a phenomenon or a main idea and they record this in the intersection. I've highlighted some of the vocabulary to show you how they can intermingle across different subjects. Um The next layers where students will document what they already know about the phenomenon and then they can ask questions, draw pictures or use examples in that outer portion of the larger circle that will support their claims or provide context on the phenomenon. So this is a fun way. It's a different kind of chart. Usually you don't see this, you see what I'm gonna show you next. But having a circle to me gives it a little bit looks a little different than your normal column. And so I clicked the, I clicked the link. Here we go. Hm I've also got it linked there. So, so let me make sure. OK, here we go. So the KWL organizer is the one we're gonna talk about briefly with the phenomenon I chose um to discuss with you guys today. So in column one, and I know you, you've probably seen these, but just, just to refresh your memory in column one, they respond to that prompt that you've given them or we call it a phenomenon in science. Um What do you know about the topic and they can do it individually or in small groups. And that's kind of a, that's looking at your previous learning and your prior knowledge to see where they stand with that in second column. What do they want to know about this topic? So some of them may not know where to even begin, especially, you know, sometimes they aren't as excited about our topic as we are and they're like, I don't really care to know anything. Well, that's too bad. You're gonna learn something today. Um So you can give them the six questions of journalism to help them out. Who, what, where, when, why and how and that may get them going a little bit on their creative juices and then column three throughout your unit or your reading passage. Since we're talking about informational text students can review their KWL chart and add to column three. What did you learn? So my phenomenon I chose that we were gonna discuss in our breakout um is just a picture and then why are some stars so much brighter than others? Now, we know everyone's gonna have their answers of why they think the answer is, is what they say it is. Um They can write that down in the first column, we can discuss it verbally with students um about the questions they might have, but we wanna try to avoid providing correct answers in this beginning portion. Um because that's part of what we want them um to learn. Um So have them document their, what want to know information in the second column before we begin. Um This is the article I chose. I don't like it as much because it's not as colorful. Like Katie was saying you get those colors in there. Um But really, we're talking about the night sky and star gazing. So there's not a lot of color other than your, you know, light whites, reds and blues that you find. So what you would do is read this and then one strategy um that I like to use is where you have your students either use different colors of highlighters or however to underline, maybe what they already knew. Um highlight something they had wondered about and then highlight what they learned. Um So as an example on this next page, I keep clicking, I have that link there if you want that. Um Let me go back here. No, I've lost everything. Here we go on this page. This is just an example of how I would have done this. I underlined in red. Um in red, what I wanted to know in yellow, what I already knew I highlighted and then in blue, what I learned. Um So that is just an example of how that worked. Now in your Kwl Organizer, you want to uh document information and sometimes I feel like it bleed, it all bleeds together. I feel like this. And like Katie said with her rat article, um it all bleeds together. So the color really helps you distinguish ideas, your vocabulary, however you go with that. So during our reading, we use different colors to identify our know, want to know and our learned information. So to increase engagement with what students are reading, they need to do something active that will help them organize new information into their brains. So highlighting can be a really useful tool because when I look at this just black and white, I just see a lot of stuff and it can be overwhelming, especially if it's a lot of information, which is great. If you look in what I learned column, there's a lot of information there. So it was a good article in giving you new information. Um So using different colors to highlight each column may help students differentiate the information visually. And if they find a color coding system that works for them, if they use it across all disciplines, they really get that habit of knowing. OK, this is what I, what I new, this is what I really wanted to know about. And this is what I learned or with anything you're doing it with, if they highlight their vocabulary, a certain color and then other things, a different color, different information that can really help them pull those pieces out. So it doesn't just look like it all blended together. So, what I wanted to do is what I did is I went ahead and typed in what I underlined in the previous slide, what I highlighted in those areas and put them in my columns. So my yellow was what I knew. My red was what I wanted to know and my blue is what I learned. Um So I show you just quickly using the highlighting, it separates it for me a little bit more and makes it a little more colorful and just for me that helps it not all bleed together. Um And you could even just highlight just a certain word in each sentence or however you would want to do with that. Um But that is just one organizer that you can use um with your students. And again, I have them all them linked in the presentation that you have a copy of. Um And that's all I have for science. Uh I'm gonna stop sharing really quick. I like, like Katie said, we're kind of moving along. We're not doing breakouts with, with our small crowds. So, um but I know Lindsay has some great information in this el A portion. Thank you, Tara. So, um first off, I have to apologize. I didn't close out all my tabs. So if you see all my tabs, when I share my screen, just, uh you know, I hope that that doesn't cause anybody stress. So, um with that being said, first thing, um we're gonna spend some time in the presentation itself talking about our breakout and then I'm gonna show you how you can use active reading strategies in a virtual setting um using near pod. So not only am I talking about the strategy but also illustrating how it can be adapted to our model. Um I will say I found that when I was thinking about this presentation to be a useful technique because I'm very old school. Um when I think about active reading, you know, I think about my army of highlighters and my post it notes and you know, my underlining and my little chicken scratch in the margins. But when we're adapting that to an online situation, it has, you know, it has to be adapted, you know, um The cool thing about being adaptive in this instance is that it also means that your students can share that information with you. So you can see their process as they go through active reading. So keep in mind also the strategies that we are showing you today can be adapted across all of these um different subject areas. And in fact, active reading applies to anything anytime your students have to read, whether that's, you know, an el a piece in social studies in science or even word problems in math. So active reading strategies are very, very helpful in that regard. So moving on to practice standards now, I just selected the uh the reading and writing process standards as a starting point. But if you think about it, active reading could apply to any of the different strands within el A, whether that's critical reading and writing vocabulary language or even into the research section, which you'll see, we talk a lot about creating questions and that is a driving force when you're creating a research project as well. But for right now, just keep these standards in mind first off talking about summarizing alphabetic or multimodal texts about similar topics to demonstrate comprehension within and between texts. 82 R two talks about analyzing details in fiction, poetry and nonfiction, text to identify characteristics of genres. And then part three students will paraphrase a passage in their own words to demonstrate comprehension. So let's move into the active reading strategies themselves. First off, what is active reading? OK. Um Have you ever been reading something? And you go through two or three pages and it's like you just dissociated or something, you, you think, well, what did I just read? And then you have to go back and reread it again. You know, you might have been distracted. Something else was on your mind or you just kind of got lost in the process of reading, but you weren't really registering what was happening in the text, active reading kind of jolts you out of that process. Um in a very similar fashion, if you find yourself taking notes during a meeting instead of simply listening, um that means that you're actively listening. So you're engaging with what someone is telling you. Active reading is a very similar strategy. Um It just means that you're reading with the determination to understand and evaluate the text for your needs and speaking of needs, you have to think about what is the purpose of instructing your students to actively read, you know, are they getting ready to take a test and they need to be, you know, engaging with the text? Are they preparing to write an essay? So they need to be gathering information. Um Basically, what's our goal here? You know, so that leads us to the next section. How do you use active reading strategies? If you think about active reading, it, it can follow the same structure as a lesson. So you have your pre reading area where you establish your purpose for reading and then during reading, you have activities that your students can work on independently or in small groups, then you have post reading where you will remember and review the material you've covered. So finally, how can we adapt active reading strategies to our model? So first off, um you might be familiar with Sora our library app as well as many other e reading resources that already implement tools for active reading. Um For instance, you can highlight, you can um you can make notations. Um One of the neat things about reading in Kindle as an example is that you can see how many people have um you know, made a note or underlined a, a phrase or a passage. Um When you're reading, I always find that kind of interesting because sometimes there are things that resonate with a lot of people and then sometimes you're the very first person to find a passage, you know, impactful. So it's kind of neat that that function is there. Um But keep in mind, you know, those, those E reading um platforms do offer us a way to, you know, reinforce active reading with our students. Um You can use those instruction, but near pod is another great resource to actually break down active reading strategies with your students and, and practice with them before you let them practice on their own, you know, with a book in Sora or, you know, if they have a Kindle as an example, so we'll go through all of the strategies and then I'll show you the process of building out um a lesson in near pod so that you can see, you know, some of the steps that I took to make active reading available on an online platform. So first up, let's talk about pre reading. We always wanna tell our students or, or work out with our students the purpose of what we're doing. Um You know, you probably have encountered this to students ask, why are we doing this? You never wanna tell them something like, well, we just have to, you know, that's not very fun. That doesn't, that doesn't spark curiosity. But if you can introduce the text or the active reading strategy or whatever the case may be to them, show them the purpose of it, show them how this can help them understand the larger context, show them how it connects to something they've previously learned. Um You know, are they trying to find the answer to a question? Are they trying to form an opinion on a subject? Are they trying to challenge their own opinions by reading something that, you know, presents a different view or are we just trying to learn more about a situation by answering the question? Why are we doing this? We are giving our students the springboard, you know, to take accountability for their own learning and that's a really powerful concept. So next, look at the question. So once you've determined purpose, consider premade questions. So, you know, if there's a, you know, assignment that goes along with the reading passage, look at those questions before you dive into reading the piece or if it's something that they're working on research for themselves, like they're writing an essay or preparing a research project, have them develop questions of their own that they want to have answered. So, going through that process again, it sparks curiosity and it allows your students to, you know, feel accountable for what they're learning. So then you do kind of what Katie was talking about with, read around the text. You take note of the various things that surround the text such as the title, the organizational structure and the special features of the text. A lot of times, quite a bit of meaning can be constructed just from taking note of those special features. Um Titles can be super informative, especially subtitles of different sections. Um Organizational structure tells us a lot about where we can locate specific information. Um And I also linked in um the particular lesson from our lesson library that corresponds to tech structure. And again, when you are talking about those things, you're connecting it to their prior knowledge. Like, hey, do you guys remember when we did informational writing? And we talked about the Venn diagram? Well, this is also an informational piece that's organized the same way. So we can use the Venn Diagram to break down this article the same way that we did your paper. So those special features, those are great ways to help students prepare for the text that they're about to read. And as Katie pointed out that visual element can be super engaging for our students. So if our articles have pictures or infographics, those are super wonderful ways to get our kids on board and, and excited about what they're gonna read. So next, let's move into the during reading, the things we're going to do while we're reading and here's where we're going to be talking about the deliberate and actively engaged activities. So you can see the picture that I've chosen. You know, it shows a person highlighting with different colors. This is especially fun for kids who are very visually stimulated or they just really like the colorful aspect of using different colors, um that can be really helpful for them and it helps them organize, you know, their thoughts. The goal of active reading is that we interact, you know, we don't want to just skim and just like kind of like be passive in our reading. So in a sense, your students are like hunters, um they have their tools like their highlighter, their, their post it nodes or the tools that we're u we're using in near pod. Um But they're gonna use those tools to basically hunt the information that they need from the text. So underlining or highlighting the text is a great way to make details stand out. Um For instance, if you had, you know, if you're doing this physically with students in person, you could say we're going to highlight the main idea or the topic sentence or the thesis statement with yellow. Um And then we're going to um you know, find supporting details and maybe we can highlight that with orange just to make it stand out, you know, like this is the main idea and this is what goes in support of it. However, all right, and I know you guys have probably seen this too. Um Have you ever seen a kid who just highlights everything, you know, like you look through their textbook and it's just all yellow. Well, that defeats the purpose of highlighting. Um it doesn't allow the really important details to stand out. So practicing that with your students and showing them good examples versus bad can be super helpful. Now, another thing is annotations in the margins. Um I remember having a lot of discussions about this both as a student in high school, um as a student teacher in college and then later on as a teacher, um you know, some teachers would very highly discourage annotation. Um but that's where post notes can come in and be very, very helpful. And if the student is using their own book, then obviously annotation can be really helpful. And um you know, it's their own book, it's their own property. If they want to make annotations, then that's great. And then in the online sense, you know, no harm, no foul. It's not gonna hurt anybody if they make annotations. But what you can do with that is make summarization points. Um, you can jot down little questions that you have that occur to you as you're reading. Um, if you have an objection to something that's being read, um, you know, like for instance, if I'm looking at an article and I'm trying to identify the author's bias. Well, if I, if I find an example of that, then that post and it's gonna go right there probably with a couple of big arrows drawn on it too. So I, I really can remember later, hey, this was important. Um And then examples too. So annotation can be very, very helpful in terms of just helping us connect to the text. A few other activities for us to do during reading is to ask questions of the text. And this relates back to what Tara was talking about with Kwl. Um We, you know, we have a lot of questions as we read through something, but we don't necessarily remember to, you know, write that down in the moment, but thinking about who wrote this, when did they write it? Um Who's our intended audience? And what was the purpose of writing this piece? How does it connect to my prior knowledge? All of those questions are really important uh for us to consider as we're reading through an informational text. I mean, because, you know, going back to the concept of bias, um knowing all of those answers to those questions and, and looking them up after we've read the informational text really helps us identify what was the bias of the author if there was one. And keep in mind also, um writing from their standpoint in history can also be AAA part of perspective. And so understanding that and putting it into its proper, you know, frame of mind really helps us understand the informational text in the larger context. So next test yourself or test your student after reading a text through recall, you can use a main geographic organizer or any other method that your students might be comfortable with to have them try to recall as much as possible about the text. And if they find themselves, like, uh I didn't really remember the middle part very well. Like I remembered the intro pretty well and I really had the conclusion down, but some of the points in the middle kind of were lost on me, then that's your chance to go back through and try, you know, finding more information just so that that feels a little more fixed in your mind. Then we move into post reading. So first off remembering what we've read is really important. And I think that that's something a lot of kids struggle with um especially because reading it, it does demand a little bit more of us than, you know, let's say tiktok. Um But one technique that really, really helps cement something in your mind is explaining what you've read to someone else. So if you're meeting, you know, in a group setting, maybe in a co op having your student turn to the person next to them and talk about what they've read. That's a really great way to get their memory sort of fixed on what they've just finished reading. But you can also make this work in the online setting too. If you're meeting just one on one, just have them like kind of summarize the story in their own words to you while they're talking to you. Or if you have like an epic live class, for example, you can have kids break into quick breakout sessions of a minute or so where they talk to the neighbor beside them, but in a virtual format, um also using near pod, which we're going to see in just a second, they can type into an answer section on near pod, their explanation of the text. So that way there's actually like a written piece that goes along with that. Um And of course, this can be modified in so many different ways. And as you, you know, apply it, you'll probably find out what works really well for your students next. You want to give your students an opportunity to review. Um Sometimes that can just be looking back over a specific section, but it can also mean rereading the entire piece. If they weren't actively engaged in the first point, then apply. So this obviously ties back to the idea of purpose. Why am I reading this? I have to have something that this connects back to. So they're ready for that next step when they get to this point, answering their assignments, questions, going to the next step with their essay or whatever the case may be. Um Once you've gotten through the review process, you're ready to actually put your knowledge to work. So next, we're gonna talk about using near pod for active reading. Um Keep in mind that each phase of active reading can be covered with a near pod lesson. Um And you also don't have to do this every time your student has a text to read, once you've gone through this process and shown them, you know, what is active reading, you can make reference to it when you're working with them. Um But they will, you know, take what they need from the process and then apply it to their own work. And of course, you know, sometimes with younger students, middle schoolers as an example, um this needs to be done more often, but periodically you can just check back in with them and make sure that they're using active reading techniques. So with that being my ear pod area and I'm actually in the editing section. I didn't want to share like a finished blessing because I wanted to show kind of the nuts and bolts of building out a lesson like this. So I chose, um I chose an article from reworks dot org and I actually used it in a couple of different ways with my lesson. So actually I think I'll back this up just a little bit so you can kind of see my starting point. So I'm in my near, near pod library. As soon as that screen populates. There we go. OK. So what I did to start this off was I clicked on create a lesson. All right. And since I'm right here um already with my work, I'm gonna click into it to edit. And the first thing that I did was I took a paragraph from my, my text that I wanted to work with today. And I just basically come on, let me open it. There we go. So I took a paragraph because I wanted to illustrate some of the techniques of active reading with my students. So basically what you can do here when you're um in a slide basically is you've got your highlighter, you've got the eraser and you've got the crayon. So if I wanted to underline, I could do that, um we could talk, you know, very briefly just about some of the main concepts that stand out from this paragraph. Um ask your students, you know, as a, as an example, what are the two subjects of this paragraph? Um California and Mesopotamia after they've read through it and you might notice that they, you know, a few details stand out such as the times that are mentioned and things like that. So basically, by having just a little portion of the, the full article in front of you, you can show some of the techniques of active reading. Um But it's also there's no assignment really tied with this section. You're just illustrating. This is what active reading looks like when you're working digitally. So then going back to the edit screen, the second thing I did was um I have the entirety of the article in front of us and I put in, I put it in the draw it um category within near pod. So here I can add in instructions to my students. This is where they can actually interact with the text and add in their own, you know, um annotations highlighting anything like that. And as you can see, um it includes the entirety of the text. So instead of trying to put, you know, the whole text into a slide, um you have the whole text here basically as a PDF. And with that, um the last section that I wanted to illustrate is that you can add open ended questions that your students can answer after they have looked through. And because near pod can be self paced, they can return back to the text anytime they want to as they're answering their open ended questions. So as an example, I didn't go super in depth with the type of questions that I created. I think the question I made was um summarize in your own words. What is the main idea of this passage? Yeah. So it's a very simple open ended question, but it would require your student to actually have read the text and to comprehend it. And you can also add into this, like, how long do you want it to be? Um you know, if they wanted to um actually like try paraphrasing, they could do that as well. The options are open, you know, it just depends on what your students know at this point and what they're comfortable, you know, kind of using in the context of active reading. So with that being said, that kind of brings us the conclusion. Actually, I'm going to to the presentation and show one more time our survey link. Thank you all so much for attending today. Um Our survey link is here. Um If you have the link to the presentation, you can uh click on that and open it up and, and submit that for us. Or if you have the QR reader on your chromebook or phone, you can use it there too. Just keep in mind we are, we love to answer questions. We love to talk about our subject areas with teachers. So if you have any questions, feel free to uh reach out to us via email or office hours or fresh service. We, we love to talk to you guys. So I'm gonna drop this into the chat one more time and then turn off my screen share. Thank you so much, Lauren. That's so sweet of you. I'll turn off screen share at this point. All righty. So Tara Katie, do you guys have anything else that you want to talk about in the couple of minutes we have left? Yeah, I just wanted to mention um when Lindsay was talking about annotations, it reminded me that we have another great platform in addition to near pod that you can practice annotations with and that is New Ella. Um And on our top five actually included a bunch of information that should make that process very simple and easy for you to follow. Um The great thing about New Zella is that it has an opportunity for you as the teacher to provide annotations um and as well to have your students provide response annotations. So you can highlight a piece of text and pose a question for your students or pose a prompt or, or an activity or a task that they should do um in response and then you can kind of engage back and forth through the text um through that platform and it is enterprise wide again, this year, including our high school students. So last year we only had three through eight. This year, it goes all the way up to 12, so 3 to 12. Um, so I don't think that one is completely up and running just yet, or maybe it is, I haven't checked in the last couple of days, to be honest. Um, but once we have access to that, if we don't already, that is definitely something that you should check into and I actually plan to possibly do a PD in the coming months. Um I'm using that and engaging with informational texts through that platform. So look forward to that. I'll update my slide on that too. Yeah, they give you great topics as maybe a hook or a phenomenon to talk about um to get your students engaged and then you get into the, the part of learning and things. So I love it. I get it, I get it in my email every day and it just, it's real world topics that are in the news and it's, it's el A, it's science and it's social studies and they, you know, I have done a search and they have almost 100% oas alignment. So you, they have our standards loaded in there. You can search a standard and more than likely at least one article will pop up for you that you can use and engage with your students um to cover that and they've got lessons and things too. It's great. Anyway, so a future PD to come learn more about that. Thank you guys for coming. Thank you. Yep, Lindsay, I'm gonna go in.\"), (432, 503, 3447, \"Ok, good morning. My name is Tracy Gray and I am the support, uh for Waterford curriculum. Um, and I am the pre K through fifth grade instructional coach as well. And I am a reading specialist and I, um, have link my water for office hours. It will be two days a week, Monday and Wednesdays. And, um, it's a calendly link and so you'll just sign up for that if you, um, ever need to come to office hours. Ok. And it is on the F one page. So today, what we're gonna do is we're going to, um, see a, a webinar of what's new for Waterford. Um, and then after that, we'll have a Q and A session, but I'm sure that they're probably going to answer a lot of the questions that you may have, um, on the webinar. But if not, we will address those questions as well. Ok. And again, um, I will have this presentation for you all as well. All right, we're gonna go ahead. Thanks. We are gonna get started. Uh, today we, our topic is what's new in the Waterford Breeding Academy and it's what's new for back to school, um 2020 to 23. I don't know about some of you, but um a lot of the districts that um I work with are already uh either went back this week or starting back next week. So, uh uh we're excited to be able to share this information with you. Uh Your two presenters today will be Sheila Montreat. She's the manager of partners of our partners, success team and myself. I'm Vicky Ross and I'm the VP of Professional Services up here at Waterford. The first thing I'd like to share with you is our mission and we are very um much um committed to family empowerment, equity and universal literacy. And if you would, we would love for you. Um I'll mention this now to engage with us by using um the chat feature within uh Zoom. So uh please put any questions or any comments there. And uh we do have behind the scenes. We have Madison and she will be um monitoring the chat for us so that we can answer questions at the end of our presentation. And um oh, sorry, Vicky, I was gonna turn it over to you. Go ahead, Sheila. So um as Vicky said, my name is Sheila Mont and I'm the manager of the partner success team and this is a picture of all my team members. Um I'm, I'm just want to make sure you're all aware that each partner that we work with is assigned their own partner success advocate to help you through any of your setup, anything you need throughout the year, we're here for you. So, each of us have, um, accounts assigned to us. And if it, during this meeting you don't know who your partner success advocate is. If you put your name and your district in state in the, um, the chat, they'll respond and let you know who they are and we would be happy to reach out and get acquainted. Um But we're there to help you throughout your whole time with Waterford. All right. Um And this is just a quick overview of our agenda today. Um We're so excited about new features that we have for this back to school year. Um We have new functionality. We're gonna share some new resources, some student enhancements and family enhancements as well as new educator tools, administrator tools and then a lot of help tools to help you navigate things throughout the school year. And um Vicky's gonna talk to you about some new functionalities that we have here at Waterford. The main functionality I'm gonna talk to you about today is Waterford Playlists. And in case you're wondering what, what is a playlist? It's a group of digital activities, the they organized into a sequence and they meet the need of a specific learning objective. So think about um a, a play list of songs that you might make in a certain genre. Um a playlist is similar except it is, of course, Waterford activities, digital activities. Um Why would you want to use it um to introduce the concept and to differentiate your instruction um in the classroom? As a side note, uh the new playlist feature in the Waterford Reading Academy does replace um classroom advantage which some of you may be familiar with. So I have exciting news for those of you that are, are administrators that have joined us today. Um You now have access to playlists. Um If you remember those of you that used um the um our legacy manager, you did not have the ability to um you could see playlists. Well, you can't even access them nor could you create them. So now you can, it's unrestricted acce access. Um playlists can be assigned to a group of students um and in or individual learners so, or you can use them um a large group, a whole group. So to locate playlists, what you'll need to do is you will access the resources and activities tab in the Waterford um Reading Academy. And that, that's what that tab looks like right there. And I wanna mention that there are over um 1000, 212 100 playlists that have been Waterford has created for you um within, within this tab on your playlist. So let's take a look at how we're gonna find them. So once you are in the resources and activities, uh tab, you're going to choose, view all activities, you'll see that there and then what you'll do is this little button will pop up and this is where you'll be able to locate all the playlists that are available to you or my playlist, which would be playlists that you would create. So let's talk just for a couple of minutes about the look and feel of that in the Waterford Reading Academy. So under our tips and tricks, you'll notice that this is an example here on the right of what a a sample playlist would look like. Um We recommend that playlist be brief uh five or fewer activities. And you'll see here, we have 12345 activities. Um You want them to be intentional, you want them to include instruction and then you want to include practice for your students. So there's three practice activities here and then it's always a good idea to include some type of an assessment. And um you don't really want to be all over the map with these, you really want them to focus on a specific skill. So if you'll take a good close look at this one, you'll see that this one focuses on the sound P, the letter P. So then you get to decide as a teacher, as an educator, where do you want that playlist to appear? Do you want it before or do you want it after your students regular learning session within Waterford and then you also can decide, do you want them to see it um access immediately or you can assign it to appear on a certain date and you can even have a due date for your playlist. Sheila is now gonna introduce you to some new resources. A sticky. Um One of the things we're really excited about this year is that we're providing you with more math and science resources than we have in the past. So if you want to switch to that next slide, Vicky, there we go. Thank you. Um We've added 100 and 18 basic math and 41 basic science activities and then 62 fluent math and 25 fluent science activities. And all of these are available both in English and Spanish, which will be a huge benefit for teachers to have those already in both languages. Awesome. We also have um refreshed many of our songs and we know that everybody loves the Waterford songs. They get stuck in your head for a long time. Um I love this quote that I just wanted to read out loud to you um regarding windows and mirrors and it says curriculum needs to function both as a window and as a mirror. If the student is understood as occupying a dwelling itself, education needs to enable the student to look through the window frames in order to see the realities of others and into mirrors in order to see his or her own reality reflected. And that's by Emily Seed. And I just, I love that, that our curriculum should show both windows and mirrors to the students. And we have got so many um, new songs that have really updated a lot of our older songs too. Um One of the things that we really love to share is our sing around the world songs. And that's a collection of 27 songs and 23 languages from around the world. And during these songs, the learning goals that we cover are lower case letters, text directionality and we expose learners to all to new cultures and languages. Um One of the questions we're often asked is will they encounter the songs on their own? And the answer is yes, they're built into their adaptive learning path. So the students have the opportunity to encounter them on their own and, and they really love learning these songs and hearing these songs from around the world. Um This next slide shows you an example of one of our old, how the old graphics looks and the new graphics and this is one the painted rooster um which is a song from Argentina and the painted rooster needed new audio. So we partnered with a consultant that was native to Argentina to assess and update the need, the needs to the lyrics and to create new music, the singer in the song. And the song is an Argenti Argentinian teenager and the visuals were inspired by the colorful lively neighborhood of La Boca Argentina. Our team has been thinking about the concept of disability, visibility. And here we found an opportunity to include a person who uses a wheelchair. This clip includes the lyrics in a border frame section where students can practice print directionality skills by following the text on the screen from left to right and top to bottom. And each of our songs around the world contain a frame section like this so they can practice those skills. Um On the next slide, we're gonna let you just see a snippet of one of our songs and this one actually comes from Bangladesh and it has a lovely uh catchy title. It's called Iry, Micky Cham Chicky. So we're gonna let you just listen to see what one of these songs might sound like. Um Chick. He so eating insects. R Sweet. Why Nick Tomar looking for his spot, his Rushing Sea seeing it's too late now. No more. Sing for eating insects. Fall in the rice with the spade. Take a swipe but the blade is too. Plant. Fox is laughing so fun. What you believe? She, we no auntie. T she. Hello. All right. And now Vicky is gonna go over some of the student enhancements with you. All right. The first enhancement I'm gonna speak about is viewing view remaining time in session. We had many educators ask us for this um for this feature because before, you know, you would see your um you either would have no time down here or you would have like the time the initial time in the session. So this um feature allows you to see how much time is left in the daily session. And another great thing is that if the student, the child is interrupted during the session, the next time they log in, they'll resume right where they left off. So I think everyone's gonna really enjoy that, that particular feature. Hey, we have updated our settings on math speed games. This was another um suggestion that um different teachers had let us know that they thought that their students were struggling with the math speed games. So we have added more time for students um to answer individual questions within activities. We have also um added, made sure the students have more over all time to complete the activity itself. Um These adjustments should significantly reduce repetition for these activities. So, um if they don't, please let us know, but um it's been, we've been, we've tested this out and it does seem to be working quite well. So I'm pleased to tell you about that particular um enhancement for our students. I'm now gonna speak to you about um uh one of our family enhancements in the program in the Water for Breeding Academy. We have updated our family math and science learning tips. Um also known as mentor messages. We have reduced the message length, we've definitely improved the formatting and pleased to tell you, we've included um hyperlinks now to activities for the families, for the caregivers. So, and they're available in, in both English and in Spanish. And just as a reminder on Mondays, the message that families receive is personalized to their child's progress in the program. The Wednesday message or nudge is a personalized activities um suggestions based on the child's last mastered skill. So I think it's pretty cool that these are both of these are personalized to their um individual student um or a child fri on Fridays. You also, the families receive a mindset skill activity that they can do with their child such as um they, it might, they're studying the letter B. They uh the nudge could be, hey um over the weekend, why don't you um if you're going to the grocery, have your student point out things that start would be and all of the activities that we suggest are um designed to be done um quickly and to involve both the caregiver and their child. And we really are trying to be really aware of not um suggesting things that um have a cost associated with them. So I think that's pretty cool. Sheila will now present you some very exciting new educator tools. Yes, we love um We love getting feedback and we try to always improve, to address the things that you would, you would like to see in our program. So one of the things that, that we've improved on is being able to see the student progress toward their end of the year goal. Um, to view course enrollment at a glance and to report a problem when there's a problem with, um, the system. So when you first log into the dashboards, um, you will see that there's this new feature that green line there with the, with the green star that is showing where your students um goal is. And if um so that you can see how close they are to reaching that goal, that's a new edition this year. And I think that's a great addition. So you get a quick glance to see how close are they to reaching their goal. Um Also you will see the percentage of the students goal, not their course completion. So you can see that um Athena there is at 100 and 43% of her goal. So definitely surpassing her goal there. Yep, another thing you're able to do from, from this page is you can adjust the students goal if their goal was a little too. Um You need to make it a little bit more attainable for them. You can adjust it by just clicking on those three lines there and you can adjust the goal from this dashboard screen, which is an awesome feature. Um Next, we have a way for you to quickly see which courses your students are enrolled at, at a glance. So if you're on the view, if you make sure you're on the student view and in the course and goals tab of Waterford Reading Academy, you can see all of the courses are assigned. And then if you click on a specific student, you can then go in and adjust if you need to adjust how many minutes they're using, or if you need to adjust how many days they use or their goal, you can do it there at that, at that point as well. So those features make it a really quick for teachers to just adjust those student learning goals. Um On that next slide, um there are so many different um devices that we that schools use that sometimes things don't work as expected. And so um to make it easier for you to and to let us know when you run into hiccups, we've added a way to capture the information that we need in order to troubleshoot. So for example, if you came up to a problem that there was something wrong with your students um devices they were using. If you click on that little gear up in the right hand corner, you'll be given this little math problem to solve. Um the reason it's a math problem and not just a button and Children are very smart and they can click, they figure out ways to get around systems. And so instead of it just being a button. It's a math problem. And most pre K to two year olds are, are too second graders aren't gonna be able to solve that problem. So if you, um, once that comes up, you will get a problem, you'll type in the numerical answer and then once that comes up, you'll have the option of either exiting the program, skipping, restarting or reporting a problem. So, um, if you click or tap restart, it's going to restart the activity only and not the session time, the session time will still be the same. So that's a really good addition to, to what has been in the past. Also, if you were to click, continue when choosing restart, a message gonna be automatically sent to Waterford, that will report the problem so that they can track and monitor it. So you won't have to take time from your teaching to write down which device it was. Um what exactly was happening. It will just send that information to Waterford directly so we can track that problem for you. And then if you click, um skip that will of course, skip the activity, but we really want to caution you not to use that regularly. Um That's just if there's a, a problem where it's stuck, um Go ahead and skip the activity but that shouldn't be used um Unless it was really necessary. Um And that, um I'll turn the time back over to Vicky to go through some of the admin tools that we've added. All right, thanks. I'm excited about this. Um The reporter problem gonna make a huge, huge difference. No more screenshots. No more, you know, interrupting your time. I love it. Sheila, thanks. So we're gonna talk about some new admin tools. Uh We have new managed licenses more efficiently. Uh We're now able to um and have you, you can tag your students for easy grouping and reporting and you can transfer students now within your district, not just school. And I think that's a real um value add right there too. So managing your license, let's talk a little bit about this. Um You are able to assign licenses to the schools within your district. Um District purchase versus school purchase licenses. And what that means is many times a district will purchase um a certain number of licenses and then a school will say, well, gosh, I really wanna use this with another grade level. So, but now I have some money. So I'm gonna, I wanna get licenses also. So we're now able to differentiate between the two so that you can access district licenses and you'll see how your the school purchase licenses and um they're just available to your, your particular site. Um You will also now be able to monitor your license allocation. Uh You'll see how many licenses are purchased, how many license are reserved for each school versus unreserved and the number of licenses assigned to students versus unassigned within each school. So let's see what that looks like. So, um this is what the new license allocation looks like. Um Admins are um uh district admins have access to this um to looking at, to allocate to actually allocating the licenses. Um schools, teachers principals can look at um their own particular schools um allocation. So you're gonna go to organizations and then click on the um license allocation tab right here. And then you'll see like in the, in this particular one, you have a district total of 200 students, it shows that the district purchased 200 licenses. They've assigned 100 and 40 of them. There's 60 that um are unassigned or floating. So, and then this shows they've been, you know how they, how that pans out how they reserved them and what are unreserved. So let's take a look. Um, a typical, well, and let me talk for a minute too. A typical best practice is for the district admin to assign licenses to each school. Um If not schools can reserve licenses from licenses from the district pool. Um And we've talked about reserved and assigned. So, um here's, here's the, here's the usage rules. The licenses purchased by the school are used first. Next come district reserved licenses. District unreserved. We saw those floating licenses and here's something new that I think everybody um probably is gonna give a cheer about if none of the above licenses are available, an error message will appear when assigning a course to a student. Um What happened um, prior to this, um, this new feature is that you and I've done this myself, I would assign a license to a student for certain, you know, for whatever programs I wanted them to use within the Waterford Reading Academy. And I think, ok, great. And it would just, you know, let me do it. And next day the student would try to access the program and none of their, none of their pro none of their um uh software would be there for them to use. So, um and I didn't know that it was because they didn't have enough licenses. Now, you're gonna know that right away if that's an issue and we, and someone needs to re, you know, reallocate licenses or um purchase uh additional licenses. So I think that everyone will appreciate that. All right, next, coming soon by coming soon, this is set to go a lot, go live on August the 10th. Um, districts are going to be able to create or schools sites create tags for easy grouping and reporting. Um So what is a tag? A tag provides district admins with the ability to create it. And um examples may include, uh you know, your students, you might maybe you wanna um tag and see how all of your students that are in RT I or MTSS are doing. Um, you might want to compare groups um for data. So you can um have the tag for English language learners, you can have ones for special ed head start. And these are just examples you, um, this, excuse me, this particular feature allows you to name name tags, whatever you, you know, choose to do how however you wanna name them. So let's take a look at what that looks like. So, um, we're gonna go to organization tab and then we are going to tag manager and here's where you can add a tag and you just type in whatever name, what, how whatever tag you want to put in there and click on add, you know, click on, add a tag and then save so that I think that is um gonna be very helpful to everyone. Um You also can, um, if you wanna see, you know what a parti how a particular group is doing, this is what it would look like. So you would go to your dashboard and on your dashboard, you would choose um district. And then this particular, this particular example is of early reading. And then as you come down here with the tags, if you got, if you've, you know, enabled the tags, this particular tag would be for head start. So that's, that's how I would filter it. And then when I look across, let's see, see what's going on here. I have surpassing my goal is the green, right? Here. And that means the student is projected to surpass their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the blue on track student is projected to meet their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the pink is where we've taken action. The student is not currently projected to meet their goal, but an but an action plan has been taken by their teacher and Sheila showed us what that action plan looks like. That would be either changing the time um that they're um have access, you know, the the length of their session or adjusting their goal and then need action is the orange. And that means the student is not currently projected to meet their goal and has not been assigned an action plan as of yet by their teacher. So that's, that's what that dashboard is telling you and what it looks like. OK? And then you also can look at um a a student, you know, a tag for by student. So this is an example of that. So here's our student and you look down here and you can see that the student is tagged is, has been given a head start tag. So you can, you know, do groups of students, you can do individual students. OK, let's talk about transferring students within your district. Um A student transfer allows you to determine if their course assignment and associated course data should follow that student to a new school within your district. So, um you'll find this setting. Um and we'll take a look at this in a minute on the district organization level and district admins um can uh give permission for this level setting. So here we go. So here what come back. Sorry, there we go. All right. So transferring student. So this is where you'll find it. You go to organization, you go to settings, student transfer and you'll see down here where it says retain course data when students transfer in the district and then you're just gonna click that box and save and that way um they, you know, say that students going leaving on a Friday um and they're, they're, you know, gonna sink to a new dis new school in the district on Monday. They can go ahead and um start right where they left off. Ok? Sheila is excited. She's gonna acquaint you with some of our brand new help tools. So ready. Yes, I'm ready for that. Um We wanna always make sure you find help when you need help with the program very easily. And so one thing we've added this year is contextual help and that's help that's within the program and they're specific to permissions and where you are in the program. So um when you're in Waterford Reading Academy, you will see a question mark in the lower right hand corner and if you click on that, it's going to come up with articles that would help you where you're at in the program. So, it's kind of thinking ahead of where you might need those, those helps. So, um, if you'll click one more screen, yeah, you'll see that the articles that come up are ones that might be beneficial to you to help you in that, um, area that you are. But always if it's not what you need, you can click the little support button there and the support button will take you right to um speaking with AAA partner um support rep and you just have to choose which department you want. Um add in the questions like the name of your school and district and your name and someone will be on right then and there to talk to you and help you with the, with the problem that you you've encountered. Um Just a reminder that we have lots of different options to help you. We always have our help site at help dot Waterford dot org. Live chat is always available where you can talk to a real person. It's not, it's not a computer. There are real people sitting there to talk with you. Um Tech support for any technical issues is um accessible through. Well support at Waterford dot org. Um Any general support with the program, you would reach out to my team, the partner success team at partner success at Waterford dot org. And if you need any kind of technical help. That's our technical um line. It's 8774997997. But um just as I said earlier, you, you all have a partner, success advocate that is assigned to your account. And that is our number one goal is to help you have a wonderful um implementation this year. So anytime you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us and we're there to help you. Um It's been fun for me to see and chat that a lot of my partners are there. I haven't been able to chat with you because we've been doing this. But I'm excited to get to know you and know that we have direct lines for you to contact us and emails and we're, we're happy to build that relationship with you. All right. This um this concludes our um information we wanted to share with you today and uh we would love um Madison, can you um are there some questions and chat that we need to um address? Yes, I've been writing down some questions. Thank you so much for all of them. Um And thank you to a couple, you know, to everybody else who's been kind of helping me monitor this. Um I wrote the questions down and I'll be repeating them. Um I did not word that correctly. Please message me directly. Um I'm at the Waterford dot org uh user name, so just feel free to send me a message. I'll try my best to get these started. So, um first off, um we are recording this, will all the participants get a copy of this recording? I do believe so. Yes. Ok. Yes. Ok. Another question are some of these activities available on ipads. Yes, they certainly are ipads and Android tablets? Excellent. And can I add one other thing to there, Vicky? Um All, all of our webinars that we've been doing um for this back to school will be in our help dot Waterford dot org site under the getting started hub. So you'll be able to access these webinars to um refresh and share with your staff if they don't, if they don't know some of the new features, they'll be in that um help dot Waterford dot org um site under the Getting started hub. Ok. And since we have a few minutes, I can show that to them. So help dot Waterford dot org. Yep. And if you look in here and you come right down here, help guides. Here's the getting started hub. This is something new. So, um with the help and so we have getting started hub for administrators, students and teachers. So you just click on whichever you know, I'll do for teachers right now. Just fun. And it gives you uh some the basics take you, we'll take you to the places and help where you need to go and where um chili do you know exactly where those, um, I know they're gonna live here. I'm just not sure exactly how they, yeah, I know they're doing that but they'll be able to, with them throughout the year. Um, and that's where they're gonna be. Absolutely. So that's just remember getting started up. That's where you need to go. All right. Um, go ahead, Madison. Ok. Um, and I also, I don't, I just wanted Sheila and Vicky for you guys to know faith how she, when you were playing the song, uh, she noted that her two year old came in to see what she was listening to. So that alone is no. Oh, I love that. That was awesome. I Nicky, they're gonna be singing that all day. Ok. So about the initial assessment, um, would they have access to how their Children perform on the initial assessments? Um, do they, um, I wonder if they mean the wax assessment or the placement test, placement assessment? I'll talk about both. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just talk about both. Um, the wax assessment is a, um, skills check and it's assigned, um, separate from the program. And yes, they, when your child takes wax, your child, your students take, take, takes when they take wax, it takes them about 20 to 30 minutes to, um, complete. Sometimes less, sometimes a little more depending on how well they do because it does adapt um, to where they are. Uh, and those results are available. Um, I do believe immediately under the student, under the student. Um, once they finish. Um, and that's something that we can, you know, help with, with professional services or Sheila's team can help the partner success team can certainly show you where those are as far as the placement, um, results. Um, placement is part of the program for both reading and math and science. Uh They take the students take placement when they first, um, access the program and that is about 10 to 15 minutes and it is seamless for them. Um They, they take placement and then it, the program immediately puts them into the sequence um where they are at where they're, you know, by the results that are indicated. So, um does that um I think that that would answer their questions and maths the same way? Ok. And they can access once they, once they do the assessment that Vicky just talked about, there's a report called the placement report where they can run that and they can see exactly where their student placed um in the sequence. So they get that immediate feedback of where did this student place in, in the Waterford sequence? That's correct. Excellent. Thanks. Shea. And just in case we do not get to all these questions, we're having a lot coming in. I love it. Um Can how do you find out who your support person is? Who do you contact? How do you find out who the person is to contact. If you do have questions. If they just, if you just do an email to partner success at Waterford dot org, we'll respond and let you know who that person is. Excellent. Ok. All right. So moving along, um, what? Ok, let me see. Um, so if you select to report a problem in the middle of doing an activity, what happens to the, to the student's activity? Do you still have to exit or does it do it automatically? That is a good question. That is a great question. And I don't, I don't know because I don't know if it would if usually that's when there's a problem and I imagine it would just go to the next. Can you hear me? OK. The internet, my internet is unstable. Just a second. It's still trying to buffer, let's see, still buffering my apologies. On a side note, I like how it showed how it, how you can find the placement reports. Yes. OK. I'm gonna stop sharing cause we're really at the end of the um the video of the webinar, but I will share the rest of that um with you guys. Um Let me go ahead and, and this, so back to this. So again, I will share this slide um presentation with you all. So do you all have any questions for me that I may be able to answer? If not? OK, we'll keep going. So again, this is where the um the slide presentation will be um with those individual pictures that they had of like the dashboard is gonna also be included in here as well for you. Ok? Um And then I just wanna thank you all for coming um to today's session and here is the little survey if you could fill that out. And if you want, I can put the link and two the chat as well and you can do it from there. But one of the, the, the things that I'm really excited about is um that they listen to the teachers and what they were voicing their concerns about the time. Um And also um one thing that I wanted to do, I want to remind you is that when the student takes the initial placement test, we wanna make sure that we convey uh convey to the caregivers to let that, that child do it independently because if they don't do it independently, um they're gonna go way off the charts and it's not gonna be adapted to their, really, their instructional uh learning. So we wanna make sure that they do that independently. Um And the playlist are gonna be awesome to use with your family and also making sure that you use the um family, family mentoring app, making sure that we are uh intentional about uh including the families and on what the student is learning. Um And I will have some more resources about that as well. Um So I'm gonna stop sharing, stop recording.\"), (444, 503, 3447, \"Ok, good morning. My name is Tracy Gray and I am the support, uh for Waterford curriculum. Um, and I am the pre K through fifth grade instructional coach as well. And I am a reading specialist and I, um, have link my water for office hours. It will be two days a week, Monday and Wednesdays. And, um, it's a calendly link and so you'll just sign up for that if you, um, ever need to come to office hours. Ok. And it is on the F one page. So today, what we're gonna do is we're going to, um, see a, a webinar of what's new for Waterford. Um, and then after that, we'll have a Q and A session, but I'm sure that they're probably going to answer a lot of the questions that you may have, um, on the webinar. But if not, we will address those questions as well. Ok. And again, um, I will have this presentation for you all as well. All right, we're gonna go ahead. Thanks. We are gonna get started. Uh, today we, our topic is what's new in the Waterford Breeding Academy and it's what's new for back to school, um 2020 to 23. I don't know about some of you, but um a lot of the districts that um I work with are already uh either went back this week or starting back next week. So, uh uh we're excited to be able to share this information with you. Uh Your two presenters today will be Sheila Montreat. She's the manager of partners of our partners, success team and myself. I'm Vicky Ross and I'm the VP of Professional Services up here at Waterford. The first thing I'd like to share with you is our mission and we are very um much um committed to family empowerment, equity and universal literacy. And if you would, we would love for you. Um I'll mention this now to engage with us by using um the chat feature within uh Zoom. So uh please put any questions or any comments there. And uh we do have behind the scenes. We have Madison and she will be um monitoring the chat for us so that we can answer questions at the end of our presentation. And um oh, sorry, Vicky, I was gonna turn it over to you. Go ahead, Sheila. So um as Vicky said, my name is Sheila Mont and I'm the manager of the partner success team and this is a picture of all my team members. Um I'm, I'm just want to make sure you're all aware that each partner that we work with is assigned their own partner success advocate to help you through any of your setup, anything you need throughout the year, we're here for you. So, each of us have, um, accounts assigned to us. And if it, during this meeting you don't know who your partner success advocate is. If you put your name and your district in state in the, um, the chat, they'll respond and let you know who they are and we would be happy to reach out and get acquainted. Um But we're there to help you throughout your whole time with Waterford. All right. Um And this is just a quick overview of our agenda today. Um We're so excited about new features that we have for this back to school year. Um We have new functionality. We're gonna share some new resources, some student enhancements and family enhancements as well as new educator tools, administrator tools and then a lot of help tools to help you navigate things throughout the school year. And um Vicky's gonna talk to you about some new functionalities that we have here at Waterford. The main functionality I'm gonna talk to you about today is Waterford Playlists. And in case you're wondering what, what is a playlist? It's a group of digital activities, the they organized into a sequence and they meet the need of a specific learning objective. So think about um a, a play list of songs that you might make in a certain genre. Um a playlist is similar except it is, of course, Waterford activities, digital activities. Um Why would you want to use it um to introduce the concept and to differentiate your instruction um in the classroom? As a side note, uh the new playlist feature in the Waterford Reading Academy does replace um classroom advantage which some of you may be familiar with. So I have exciting news for those of you that are, are administrators that have joined us today. Um You now have access to playlists. Um If you remember those of you that used um the um our legacy manager, you did not have the ability to um you could see playlists. Well, you can't even access them nor could you create them. So now you can, it's unrestricted acce access. Um playlists can be assigned to a group of students um and in or individual learners so, or you can use them um a large group, a whole group. So to locate playlists, what you'll need to do is you will access the resources and activities tab in the Waterford um Reading Academy. And that, that's what that tab looks like right there. And I wanna mention that there are over um 1000, 212 100 playlists that have been Waterford has created for you um within, within this tab on your playlist. So let's take a look at how we're gonna find them. So once you are in the resources and activities, uh tab, you're going to choose, view all activities, you'll see that there and then what you'll do is this little button will pop up and this is where you'll be able to locate all the playlists that are available to you or my playlist, which would be playlists that you would create. So let's talk just for a couple of minutes about the look and feel of that in the Waterford Reading Academy. So under our tips and tricks, you'll notice that this is an example here on the right of what a a sample playlist would look like. Um We recommend that playlist be brief uh five or fewer activities. And you'll see here, we have 12345 activities. Um You want them to be intentional, you want them to include instruction and then you want to include practice for your students. So there's three practice activities here and then it's always a good idea to include some type of an assessment. And um you don't really want to be all over the map with these, you really want them to focus on a specific skill. So if you'll take a good close look at this one, you'll see that this one focuses on the sound P, the letter P. So then you get to decide as a teacher, as an educator, where do you want that playlist to appear? Do you want it before or do you want it after your students regular learning session within Waterford and then you also can decide, do you want them to see it um access immediately or you can assign it to appear on a certain date and you can even have a due date for your playlist. Sheila is now gonna introduce you to some new resources. A sticky. Um One of the things we're really excited about this year is that we're providing you with more math and science resources than we have in the past. So if you want to switch to that next slide, Vicky, there we go. Thank you. Um We've added 100 and 18 basic math and 41 basic science activities and then 62 fluent math and 25 fluent science activities. And all of these are available both in English and Spanish, which will be a huge benefit for teachers to have those already in both languages. Awesome. We also have um refreshed many of our songs and we know that everybody loves the Waterford songs. They get stuck in your head for a long time. Um I love this quote that I just wanted to read out loud to you um regarding windows and mirrors and it says curriculum needs to function both as a window and as a mirror. If the student is understood as occupying a dwelling itself, education needs to enable the student to look through the window frames in order to see the realities of others and into mirrors in order to see his or her own reality reflected. And that's by Emily Seed. And I just, I love that, that our curriculum should show both windows and mirrors to the students. And we have got so many um, new songs that have really updated a lot of our older songs too. Um One of the things that we really love to share is our sing around the world songs. And that's a collection of 27 songs and 23 languages from around the world. And during these songs, the learning goals that we cover are lower case letters, text directionality and we expose learners to all to new cultures and languages. Um One of the questions we're often asked is will they encounter the songs on their own? And the answer is yes, they're built into their adaptive learning path. So the students have the opportunity to encounter them on their own and, and they really love learning these songs and hearing these songs from around the world. Um This next slide shows you an example of one of our old, how the old graphics looks and the new graphics and this is one the painted rooster um which is a song from Argentina and the painted rooster needed new audio. So we partnered with a consultant that was native to Argentina to assess and update the need, the needs to the lyrics and to create new music, the singer in the song. And the song is an Argenti Argentinian teenager and the visuals were inspired by the colorful lively neighborhood of La Boca Argentina. Our team has been thinking about the concept of disability, visibility. And here we found an opportunity to include a person who uses a wheelchair. This clip includes the lyrics in a border frame section where students can practice print directionality skills by following the text on the screen from left to right and top to bottom. And each of our songs around the world contain a frame section like this so they can practice those skills. Um On the next slide, we're gonna let you just see a snippet of one of our songs and this one actually comes from Bangladesh and it has a lovely uh catchy title. It's called Iry, Micky Cham Chicky. So we're gonna let you just listen to see what one of these songs might sound like. Um Chick. He so eating insects. R Sweet. Why Nick Tomar looking for his spot, his Rushing Sea seeing it's too late now. No more. Sing for eating insects. Fall in the rice with the spade. Take a swipe but the blade is too. Plant. Fox is laughing so fun. What you believe? She, we no auntie. T she. Hello. All right. And now Vicky is gonna go over some of the student enhancements with you. All right. The first enhancement I'm gonna speak about is viewing view remaining time in session. We had many educators ask us for this um for this feature because before, you know, you would see your um you either would have no time down here or you would have like the time the initial time in the session. So this um feature allows you to see how much time is left in the daily session. And another great thing is that if the student, the child is interrupted during the session, the next time they log in, they'll resume right where they left off. So I think everyone's gonna really enjoy that, that particular feature. Hey, we have updated our settings on math speed games. This was another um suggestion that um different teachers had let us know that they thought that their students were struggling with the math speed games. So we have added more time for students um to answer individual questions within activities. We have also um added, made sure the students have more over all time to complete the activity itself. Um These adjustments should significantly reduce repetition for these activities. So, um if they don't, please let us know, but um it's been, we've been, we've tested this out and it does seem to be working quite well. So I'm pleased to tell you about that particular um enhancement for our students. I'm now gonna speak to you about um uh one of our family enhancements in the program in the Water for Breeding Academy. We have updated our family math and science learning tips. Um also known as mentor messages. We have reduced the message length, we've definitely improved the formatting and pleased to tell you, we've included um hyperlinks now to activities for the families, for the caregivers. So, and they're available in, in both English and in Spanish. And just as a reminder on Mondays, the message that families receive is personalized to their child's progress in the program. The Wednesday message or nudge is a personalized activities um suggestions based on the child's last mastered skill. So I think it's pretty cool that these are both of these are personalized to their um individual student um or a child fri on Fridays. You also, the families receive a mindset skill activity that they can do with their child such as um they, it might, they're studying the letter B. They uh the nudge could be, hey um over the weekend, why don't you um if you're going to the grocery, have your student point out things that start would be and all of the activities that we suggest are um designed to be done um quickly and to involve both the caregiver and their child. And we really are trying to be really aware of not um suggesting things that um have a cost associated with them. So I think that's pretty cool. Sheila will now present you some very exciting new educator tools. Yes, we love um We love getting feedback and we try to always improve, to address the things that you would, you would like to see in our program. So one of the things that, that we've improved on is being able to see the student progress toward their end of the year goal. Um, to view course enrollment at a glance and to report a problem when there's a problem with, um, the system. So when you first log into the dashboards, um, you will see that there's this new feature that green line there with the, with the green star that is showing where your students um goal is. And if um so that you can see how close they are to reaching that goal, that's a new edition this year. And I think that's a great addition. So you get a quick glance to see how close are they to reaching their goal. Um Also you will see the percentage of the students goal, not their course completion. So you can see that um Athena there is at 100 and 43% of her goal. So definitely surpassing her goal there. Yep, another thing you're able to do from, from this page is you can adjust the students goal if their goal was a little too. Um You need to make it a little bit more attainable for them. You can adjust it by just clicking on those three lines there and you can adjust the goal from this dashboard screen, which is an awesome feature. Um Next, we have a way for you to quickly see which courses your students are enrolled at, at a glance. So if you're on the view, if you make sure you're on the student view and in the course and goals tab of Waterford Reading Academy, you can see all of the courses are assigned. And then if you click on a specific student, you can then go in and adjust if you need to adjust how many minutes they're using, or if you need to adjust how many days they use or their goal, you can do it there at that, at that point as well. So those features make it a really quick for teachers to just adjust those student learning goals. Um On that next slide, um there are so many different um devices that we that schools use that sometimes things don't work as expected. And so um to make it easier for you to and to let us know when you run into hiccups, we've added a way to capture the information that we need in order to troubleshoot. So for example, if you came up to a problem that there was something wrong with your students um devices they were using. If you click on that little gear up in the right hand corner, you'll be given this little math problem to solve. Um the reason it's a math problem and not just a button and Children are very smart and they can click, they figure out ways to get around systems. And so instead of it just being a button. It's a math problem. And most pre K to two year olds are, are too second graders aren't gonna be able to solve that problem. So if you, um, once that comes up, you will get a problem, you'll type in the numerical answer and then once that comes up, you'll have the option of either exiting the program, skipping, restarting or reporting a problem. So, um, if you click or tap restart, it's going to restart the activity only and not the session time, the session time will still be the same. So that's a really good addition to, to what has been in the past. Also, if you were to click, continue when choosing restart, a message gonna be automatically sent to Waterford, that will report the problem so that they can track and monitor it. So you won't have to take time from your teaching to write down which device it was. Um what exactly was happening. It will just send that information to Waterford directly so we can track that problem for you. And then if you click, um skip that will of course, skip the activity, but we really want to caution you not to use that regularly. Um That's just if there's a, a problem where it's stuck, um Go ahead and skip the activity but that shouldn't be used um Unless it was really necessary. Um And that, um I'll turn the time back over to Vicky to go through some of the admin tools that we've added. All right, thanks. I'm excited about this. Um The reporter problem gonna make a huge, huge difference. No more screenshots. No more, you know, interrupting your time. I love it. Sheila, thanks. So we're gonna talk about some new admin tools. Uh We have new managed licenses more efficiently. Uh We're now able to um and have you, you can tag your students for easy grouping and reporting and you can transfer students now within your district, not just school. And I think that's a real um value add right there too. So managing your license, let's talk a little bit about this. Um You are able to assign licenses to the schools within your district. Um District purchase versus school purchase licenses. And what that means is many times a district will purchase um a certain number of licenses and then a school will say, well, gosh, I really wanna use this with another grade level. So, but now I have some money. So I'm gonna, I wanna get licenses also. So we're now able to differentiate between the two so that you can access district licenses and you'll see how your the school purchase licenses and um they're just available to your, your particular site. Um You will also now be able to monitor your license allocation. Uh You'll see how many licenses are purchased, how many license are reserved for each school versus unreserved and the number of licenses assigned to students versus unassigned within each school. So let's see what that looks like. So, um this is what the new license allocation looks like. Um Admins are um uh district admins have access to this um to looking at, to allocate to actually allocating the licenses. Um schools, teachers principals can look at um their own particular schools um allocation. So you're gonna go to organizations and then click on the um license allocation tab right here. And then you'll see like in the, in this particular one, you have a district total of 200 students, it shows that the district purchased 200 licenses. They've assigned 100 and 40 of them. There's 60 that um are unassigned or floating. So, and then this shows they've been, you know how they, how that pans out how they reserved them and what are unreserved. So let's take a look. Um, a typical, well, and let me talk for a minute too. A typical best practice is for the district admin to assign licenses to each school. Um If not schools can reserve licenses from licenses from the district pool. Um And we've talked about reserved and assigned. So, um here's, here's the, here's the usage rules. The licenses purchased by the school are used first. Next come district reserved licenses. District unreserved. We saw those floating licenses and here's something new that I think everybody um probably is gonna give a cheer about if none of the above licenses are available, an error message will appear when assigning a course to a student. Um What happened um, prior to this, um, this new feature is that you and I've done this myself, I would assign a license to a student for certain, you know, for whatever programs I wanted them to use within the Waterford Reading Academy. And I think, ok, great. And it would just, you know, let me do it. And next day the student would try to access the program and none of their, none of their pro none of their um uh software would be there for them to use. So, um and I didn't know that it was because they didn't have enough licenses. Now, you're gonna know that right away if that's an issue and we, and someone needs to re, you know, reallocate licenses or um purchase uh additional licenses. So I think that everyone will appreciate that. All right, next, coming soon by coming soon, this is set to go a lot, go live on August the 10th. Um, districts are going to be able to create or schools sites create tags for easy grouping and reporting. Um So what is a tag? A tag provides district admins with the ability to create it. And um examples may include, uh you know, your students, you might maybe you wanna um tag and see how all of your students that are in RT I or MTSS are doing. Um, you might want to compare groups um for data. So you can um have the tag for English language learners, you can have ones for special ed head start. And these are just examples you, um, this, excuse me, this particular feature allows you to name name tags, whatever you, you know, choose to do how however you wanna name them. So let's take a look at what that looks like. So, um, we're gonna go to organization tab and then we are going to tag manager and here's where you can add a tag and you just type in whatever name, what, how whatever tag you want to put in there and click on add, you know, click on, add a tag and then save so that I think that is um gonna be very helpful to everyone. Um You also can, um, if you wanna see, you know what a parti how a particular group is doing, this is what it would look like. So you would go to your dashboard and on your dashboard, you would choose um district. And then this particular, this particular example is of early reading. And then as you come down here with the tags, if you got, if you've, you know, enabled the tags, this particular tag would be for head start. So that's, that's how I would filter it. And then when I look across, let's see, see what's going on here. I have surpassing my goal is the green, right? Here. And that means the student is projected to surpass their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the blue on track student is projected to meet their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the pink is where we've taken action. The student is not currently projected to meet their goal, but an but an action plan has been taken by their teacher and Sheila showed us what that action plan looks like. That would be either changing the time um that they're um have access, you know, the the length of their session or adjusting their goal and then need action is the orange. And that means the student is not currently projected to meet their goal and has not been assigned an action plan as of yet by their teacher. So that's, that's what that dashboard is telling you and what it looks like. OK? And then you also can look at um a a student, you know, a tag for by student. So this is an example of that. So here's our student and you look down here and you can see that the student is tagged is, has been given a head start tag. So you can, you know, do groups of students, you can do individual students. OK, let's talk about transferring students within your district. Um A student transfer allows you to determine if their course assignment and associated course data should follow that student to a new school within your district. So, um you'll find this setting. Um and we'll take a look at this in a minute on the district organization level and district admins um can uh give permission for this level setting. So here we go. So here what come back. Sorry, there we go. All right. So transferring student. So this is where you'll find it. You go to organization, you go to settings, student transfer and you'll see down here where it says retain course data when students transfer in the district and then you're just gonna click that box and save and that way um they, you know, say that students going leaving on a Friday um and they're, they're, you know, gonna sink to a new dis new school in the district on Monday. They can go ahead and um start right where they left off. Ok? Sheila is excited. She's gonna acquaint you with some of our brand new help tools. So ready. Yes, I'm ready for that. Um We wanna always make sure you find help when you need help with the program very easily. And so one thing we've added this year is contextual help and that's help that's within the program and they're specific to permissions and where you are in the program. So um when you're in Waterford Reading Academy, you will see a question mark in the lower right hand corner and if you click on that, it's going to come up with articles that would help you where you're at in the program. So, it's kind of thinking ahead of where you might need those, those helps. So, um, if you'll click one more screen, yeah, you'll see that the articles that come up are ones that might be beneficial to you to help you in that, um, area that you are. But always if it's not what you need, you can click the little support button there and the support button will take you right to um speaking with AAA partner um support rep and you just have to choose which department you want. Um add in the questions like the name of your school and district and your name and someone will be on right then and there to talk to you and help you with the, with the problem that you you've encountered. Um Just a reminder that we have lots of different options to help you. We always have our help site at help dot Waterford dot org. Live chat is always available where you can talk to a real person. It's not, it's not a computer. There are real people sitting there to talk with you. Um Tech support for any technical issues is um accessible through. Well support at Waterford dot org. Um Any general support with the program, you would reach out to my team, the partner success team at partner success at Waterford dot org. And if you need any kind of technical help. That's our technical um line. It's 8774997997. But um just as I said earlier, you, you all have a partner, success advocate that is assigned to your account. And that is our number one goal is to help you have a wonderful um implementation this year. So anytime you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us and we're there to help you. Um It's been fun for me to see and chat that a lot of my partners are there. I haven't been able to chat with you because we've been doing this. But I'm excited to get to know you and know that we have direct lines for you to contact us and emails and we're, we're happy to build that relationship with you. All right. This um this concludes our um information we wanted to share with you today and uh we would love um Madison, can you um are there some questions and chat that we need to um address? Yes, I've been writing down some questions. Thank you so much for all of them. Um And thank you to a couple, you know, to everybody else who's been kind of helping me monitor this. Um I wrote the questions down and I'll be repeating them. Um I did not word that correctly. Please message me directly. Um I'm at the Waterford dot org uh user name, so just feel free to send me a message. I'll try my best to get these started. So, um first off, um we are recording this, will all the participants get a copy of this recording? I do believe so. Yes. Ok. Yes. Ok. Another question are some of these activities available on ipads. Yes, they certainly are ipads and Android tablets? Excellent. And can I add one other thing to there, Vicky? Um All, all of our webinars that we've been doing um for this back to school will be in our help dot Waterford dot org site under the getting started hub. So you'll be able to access these webinars to um refresh and share with your staff if they don't, if they don't know some of the new features, they'll be in that um help dot Waterford dot org um site under the Getting started hub. Ok. And since we have a few minutes, I can show that to them. So help dot Waterford dot org. Yep. And if you look in here and you come right down here, help guides. Here's the getting started hub. This is something new. So, um with the help and so we have getting started hub for administrators, students and teachers. So you just click on whichever you know, I'll do for teachers right now. Just fun. And it gives you uh some the basics take you, we'll take you to the places and help where you need to go and where um chili do you know exactly where those, um, I know they're gonna live here. I'm just not sure exactly how they, yeah, I know they're doing that but they'll be able to, with them throughout the year. Um, and that's where they're gonna be. Absolutely. So that's just remember getting started up. That's where you need to go. All right. Um, go ahead, Madison. Ok. Um, and I also, I don't, I just wanted Sheila and Vicky for you guys to know faith how she, when you were playing the song, uh, she noted that her two year old came in to see what she was listening to. So that alone is no. Oh, I love that. That was awesome. I Nicky, they're gonna be singing that all day. Ok. So about the initial assessment, um, would they have access to how their Children perform on the initial assessments? Um, do they, um, I wonder if they mean the wax assessment or the placement test, placement assessment? I'll talk about both. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just talk about both. Um, the wax assessment is a, um, skills check and it's assigned, um, separate from the program. And yes, they, when your child takes wax, your child, your students take, take, takes when they take wax, it takes them about 20 to 30 minutes to, um, complete. Sometimes less, sometimes a little more depending on how well they do because it does adapt um, to where they are. Uh, and those results are available. Um, I do believe immediately under the student, under the student. Um, once they finish. Um, and that's something that we can, you know, help with, with professional services or Sheila's team can help the partner success team can certainly show you where those are as far as the placement, um, results. Um, placement is part of the program for both reading and math and science. Uh They take the students take placement when they first, um, access the program and that is about 10 to 15 minutes and it is seamless for them. Um They, they take placement and then it, the program immediately puts them into the sequence um where they are at where they're, you know, by the results that are indicated. So, um does that um I think that that would answer their questions and maths the same way? Ok. And they can access once they, once they do the assessment that Vicky just talked about, there's a report called the placement report where they can run that and they can see exactly where their student placed um in the sequence. So they get that immediate feedback of where did this student place in, in the Waterford sequence? That's correct. Excellent. Thanks. Shea. And just in case we do not get to all these questions, we're having a lot coming in. I love it. Um Can how do you find out who your support person is? Who do you contact? How do you find out who the person is to contact. If you do have questions. If they just, if you just do an email to partner success at Waterford dot org, we'll respond and let you know who that person is. Excellent. Ok. All right. So moving along, um, what? Ok, let me see. Um, so if you select to report a problem in the middle of doing an activity, what happens to the, to the student's activity? Do you still have to exit or does it do it automatically? That is a good question. That is a great question. And I don't, I don't know because I don't know if it would if usually that's when there's a problem and I imagine it would just go to the next. Can you hear me? OK. The internet, my internet is unstable. Just a second. It's still trying to buffer, let's see, still buffering my apologies. On a side note, I like how it showed how it, how you can find the placement reports. Yes. OK. I'm gonna stop sharing cause we're really at the end of the um the video of the webinar, but I will share the rest of that um with you guys. Um Let me go ahead and, and this, so back to this. So again, I will share this slide um presentation with you all. So do you all have any questions for me that I may be able to answer? If not? OK, we'll keep going. So again, this is where the um the slide presentation will be um with those individual pictures that they had of like the dashboard is gonna also be included in here as well for you. Ok? Um And then I just wanna thank you all for coming um to today's session and here is the little survey if you could fill that out. And if you want, I can put the link and two the chat as well and you can do it from there. But one of the, the, the things that I'm really excited about is um that they listen to the teachers and what they were voicing their concerns about the time. Um And also um one thing that I wanted to do, I want to remind you is that when the student takes the initial placement test, we wanna make sure that we convey uh convey to the caregivers to let that, that child do it independently because if they don't do it independently, um they're gonna go way off the charts and it's not gonna be adapted to their, really, their instructional uh learning. So we wanna make sure that they do that independently. Um And the playlist are gonna be awesome to use with your family and also making sure that you use the um family, family mentoring app, making sure that we are uh intentional about uh including the families and on what the student is learning. Um And I will have some more resources about that as well. Um So I'm gonna stop sharing, stop recording.\"), (453, 503, 3447, \"Ok, good morning. My name is Tracy Gray and I am the support, uh for Waterford curriculum. Um, and I am the pre K through fifth grade instructional coach as well. And I am a reading specialist and I, um, have link my water for office hours. It will be two days a week, Monday and Wednesdays. And, um, it's a calendly link and so you'll just sign up for that if you, um, ever need to come to office hours. Ok. And it is on the F one page. So today, what we're gonna do is we're going to, um, see a, a webinar of what's new for Waterford. Um, and then after that, we'll have a Q and A session, but I'm sure that they're probably going to answer a lot of the questions that you may have, um, on the webinar. But if not, we will address those questions as well. Ok. And again, um, I will have this presentation for you all as well. All right, we're gonna go ahead. Thanks. We are gonna get started. Uh, today we, our topic is what's new in the Waterford Breeding Academy and it's what's new for back to school, um 2020 to 23. I don't know about some of you, but um a lot of the districts that um I work with are already uh either went back this week or starting back next week. So, uh uh we're excited to be able to share this information with you. Uh Your two presenters today will be Sheila Montreat. She's the manager of partners of our partners, success team and myself. I'm Vicky Ross and I'm the VP of Professional Services up here at Waterford. The first thing I'd like to share with you is our mission and we are very um much um committed to family empowerment, equity and universal literacy. And if you would, we would love for you. Um I'll mention this now to engage with us by using um the chat feature within uh Zoom. So uh please put any questions or any comments there. And uh we do have behind the scenes. We have Madison and she will be um monitoring the chat for us so that we can answer questions at the end of our presentation. And um oh, sorry, Vicky, I was gonna turn it over to you. Go ahead, Sheila. So um as Vicky said, my name is Sheila Mont and I'm the manager of the partner success team and this is a picture of all my team members. Um I'm, I'm just want to make sure you're all aware that each partner that we work with is assigned their own partner success advocate to help you through any of your setup, anything you need throughout the year, we're here for you. So, each of us have, um, accounts assigned to us. And if it, during this meeting you don't know who your partner success advocate is. If you put your name and your district in state in the, um, the chat, they'll respond and let you know who they are and we would be happy to reach out and get acquainted. Um But we're there to help you throughout your whole time with Waterford. All right. Um And this is just a quick overview of our agenda today. Um We're so excited about new features that we have for this back to school year. Um We have new functionality. We're gonna share some new resources, some student enhancements and family enhancements as well as new educator tools, administrator tools and then a lot of help tools to help you navigate things throughout the school year. And um Vicky's gonna talk to you about some new functionalities that we have here at Waterford. The main functionality I'm gonna talk to you about today is Waterford Playlists. And in case you're wondering what, what is a playlist? It's a group of digital activities, the they organized into a sequence and they meet the need of a specific learning objective. So think about um a, a play list of songs that you might make in a certain genre. Um a playlist is similar except it is, of course, Waterford activities, digital activities. Um Why would you want to use it um to introduce the concept and to differentiate your instruction um in the classroom? As a side note, uh the new playlist feature in the Waterford Reading Academy does replace um classroom advantage which some of you may be familiar with. So I have exciting news for those of you that are, are administrators that have joined us today. Um You now have access to playlists. Um If you remember those of you that used um the um our legacy manager, you did not have the ability to um you could see playlists. Well, you can't even access them nor could you create them. So now you can, it's unrestricted acce access. Um playlists can be assigned to a group of students um and in or individual learners so, or you can use them um a large group, a whole group. So to locate playlists, what you'll need to do is you will access the resources and activities tab in the Waterford um Reading Academy. And that, that's what that tab looks like right there. And I wanna mention that there are over um 1000, 212 100 playlists that have been Waterford has created for you um within, within this tab on your playlist. So let's take a look at how we're gonna find them. So once you are in the resources and activities, uh tab, you're going to choose, view all activities, you'll see that there and then what you'll do is this little button will pop up and this is where you'll be able to locate all the playlists that are available to you or my playlist, which would be playlists that you would create. So let's talk just for a couple of minutes about the look and feel of that in the Waterford Reading Academy. So under our tips and tricks, you'll notice that this is an example here on the right of what a a sample playlist would look like. Um We recommend that playlist be brief uh five or fewer activities. And you'll see here, we have 12345 activities. Um You want them to be intentional, you want them to include instruction and then you want to include practice for your students. So there's three practice activities here and then it's always a good idea to include some type of an assessment. And um you don't really want to be all over the map with these, you really want them to focus on a specific skill. So if you'll take a good close look at this one, you'll see that this one focuses on the sound P, the letter P. So then you get to decide as a teacher, as an educator, where do you want that playlist to appear? Do you want it before or do you want it after your students regular learning session within Waterford and then you also can decide, do you want them to see it um access immediately or you can assign it to appear on a certain date and you can even have a due date for your playlist. Sheila is now gonna introduce you to some new resources. A sticky. Um One of the things we're really excited about this year is that we're providing you with more math and science resources than we have in the past. So if you want to switch to that next slide, Vicky, there we go. Thank you. Um We've added 100 and 18 basic math and 41 basic science activities and then 62 fluent math and 25 fluent science activities. And all of these are available both in English and Spanish, which will be a huge benefit for teachers to have those already in both languages. Awesome. We also have um refreshed many of our songs and we know that everybody loves the Waterford songs. They get stuck in your head for a long time. Um I love this quote that I just wanted to read out loud to you um regarding windows and mirrors and it says curriculum needs to function both as a window and as a mirror. If the student is understood as occupying a dwelling itself, education needs to enable the student to look through the window frames in order to see the realities of others and into mirrors in order to see his or her own reality reflected. And that's by Emily Seed. And I just, I love that, that our curriculum should show both windows and mirrors to the students. And we have got so many um, new songs that have really updated a lot of our older songs too. Um One of the things that we really love to share is our sing around the world songs. And that's a collection of 27 songs and 23 languages from around the world. And during these songs, the learning goals that we cover are lower case letters, text directionality and we expose learners to all to new cultures and languages. Um One of the questions we're often asked is will they encounter the songs on their own? And the answer is yes, they're built into their adaptive learning path. So the students have the opportunity to encounter them on their own and, and they really love learning these songs and hearing these songs from around the world. Um This next slide shows you an example of one of our old, how the old graphics looks and the new graphics and this is one the painted rooster um which is a song from Argentina and the painted rooster needed new audio. So we partnered with a consultant that was native to Argentina to assess and update the need, the needs to the lyrics and to create new music, the singer in the song. And the song is an Argenti Argentinian teenager and the visuals were inspired by the colorful lively neighborhood of La Boca Argentina. Our team has been thinking about the concept of disability, visibility. And here we found an opportunity to include a person who uses a wheelchair. This clip includes the lyrics in a border frame section where students can practice print directionality skills by following the text on the screen from left to right and top to bottom. And each of our songs around the world contain a frame section like this so they can practice those skills. Um On the next slide, we're gonna let you just see a snippet of one of our songs and this one actually comes from Bangladesh and it has a lovely uh catchy title. It's called Iry, Micky Cham Chicky. So we're gonna let you just listen to see what one of these songs might sound like. Um Chick. He so eating insects. R Sweet. Why Nick Tomar looking for his spot, his Rushing Sea seeing it's too late now. No more. Sing for eating insects. Fall in the rice with the spade. Take a swipe but the blade is too. Plant. Fox is laughing so fun. What you believe? She, we no auntie. T she. Hello. All right. And now Vicky is gonna go over some of the student enhancements with you. All right. The first enhancement I'm gonna speak about is viewing view remaining time in session. We had many educators ask us for this um for this feature because before, you know, you would see your um you either would have no time down here or you would have like the time the initial time in the session. So this um feature allows you to see how much time is left in the daily session. And another great thing is that if the student, the child is interrupted during the session, the next time they log in, they'll resume right where they left off. So I think everyone's gonna really enjoy that, that particular feature. Hey, we have updated our settings on math speed games. This was another um suggestion that um different teachers had let us know that they thought that their students were struggling with the math speed games. So we have added more time for students um to answer individual questions within activities. We have also um added, made sure the students have more over all time to complete the activity itself. Um These adjustments should significantly reduce repetition for these activities. So, um if they don't, please let us know, but um it's been, we've been, we've tested this out and it does seem to be working quite well. So I'm pleased to tell you about that particular um enhancement for our students. I'm now gonna speak to you about um uh one of our family enhancements in the program in the Water for Breeding Academy. We have updated our family math and science learning tips. Um also known as mentor messages. We have reduced the message length, we've definitely improved the formatting and pleased to tell you, we've included um hyperlinks now to activities for the families, for the caregivers. So, and they're available in, in both English and in Spanish. And just as a reminder on Mondays, the message that families receive is personalized to their child's progress in the program. The Wednesday message or nudge is a personalized activities um suggestions based on the child's last mastered skill. So I think it's pretty cool that these are both of these are personalized to their um individual student um or a child fri on Fridays. You also, the families receive a mindset skill activity that they can do with their child such as um they, it might, they're studying the letter B. They uh the nudge could be, hey um over the weekend, why don't you um if you're going to the grocery, have your student point out things that start would be and all of the activities that we suggest are um designed to be done um quickly and to involve both the caregiver and their child. And we really are trying to be really aware of not um suggesting things that um have a cost associated with them. So I think that's pretty cool. Sheila will now present you some very exciting new educator tools. Yes, we love um We love getting feedback and we try to always improve, to address the things that you would, you would like to see in our program. So one of the things that, that we've improved on is being able to see the student progress toward their end of the year goal. Um, to view course enrollment at a glance and to report a problem when there's a problem with, um, the system. So when you first log into the dashboards, um, you will see that there's this new feature that green line there with the, with the green star that is showing where your students um goal is. And if um so that you can see how close they are to reaching that goal, that's a new edition this year. And I think that's a great addition. So you get a quick glance to see how close are they to reaching their goal. Um Also you will see the percentage of the students goal, not their course completion. So you can see that um Athena there is at 100 and 43% of her goal. So definitely surpassing her goal there. Yep, another thing you're able to do from, from this page is you can adjust the students goal if their goal was a little too. Um You need to make it a little bit more attainable for them. You can adjust it by just clicking on those three lines there and you can adjust the goal from this dashboard screen, which is an awesome feature. Um Next, we have a way for you to quickly see which courses your students are enrolled at, at a glance. So if you're on the view, if you make sure you're on the student view and in the course and goals tab of Waterford Reading Academy, you can see all of the courses are assigned. And then if you click on a specific student, you can then go in and adjust if you need to adjust how many minutes they're using, or if you need to adjust how many days they use or their goal, you can do it there at that, at that point as well. So those features make it a really quick for teachers to just adjust those student learning goals. Um On that next slide, um there are so many different um devices that we that schools use that sometimes things don't work as expected. And so um to make it easier for you to and to let us know when you run into hiccups, we've added a way to capture the information that we need in order to troubleshoot. So for example, if you came up to a problem that there was something wrong with your students um devices they were using. If you click on that little gear up in the right hand corner, you'll be given this little math problem to solve. Um the reason it's a math problem and not just a button and Children are very smart and they can click, they figure out ways to get around systems. And so instead of it just being a button. It's a math problem. And most pre K to two year olds are, are too second graders aren't gonna be able to solve that problem. So if you, um, once that comes up, you will get a problem, you'll type in the numerical answer and then once that comes up, you'll have the option of either exiting the program, skipping, restarting or reporting a problem. So, um, if you click or tap restart, it's going to restart the activity only and not the session time, the session time will still be the same. So that's a really good addition to, to what has been in the past. Also, if you were to click, continue when choosing restart, a message gonna be automatically sent to Waterford, that will report the problem so that they can track and monitor it. So you won't have to take time from your teaching to write down which device it was. Um what exactly was happening. It will just send that information to Waterford directly so we can track that problem for you. And then if you click, um skip that will of course, skip the activity, but we really want to caution you not to use that regularly. Um That's just if there's a, a problem where it's stuck, um Go ahead and skip the activity but that shouldn't be used um Unless it was really necessary. Um And that, um I'll turn the time back over to Vicky to go through some of the admin tools that we've added. All right, thanks. I'm excited about this. Um The reporter problem gonna make a huge, huge difference. No more screenshots. No more, you know, interrupting your time. I love it. Sheila, thanks. So we're gonna talk about some new admin tools. Uh We have new managed licenses more efficiently. Uh We're now able to um and have you, you can tag your students for easy grouping and reporting and you can transfer students now within your district, not just school. And I think that's a real um value add right there too. So managing your license, let's talk a little bit about this. Um You are able to assign licenses to the schools within your district. Um District purchase versus school purchase licenses. And what that means is many times a district will purchase um a certain number of licenses and then a school will say, well, gosh, I really wanna use this with another grade level. So, but now I have some money. So I'm gonna, I wanna get licenses also. So we're now able to differentiate between the two so that you can access district licenses and you'll see how your the school purchase licenses and um they're just available to your, your particular site. Um You will also now be able to monitor your license allocation. Uh You'll see how many licenses are purchased, how many license are reserved for each school versus unreserved and the number of licenses assigned to students versus unassigned within each school. So let's see what that looks like. So, um this is what the new license allocation looks like. Um Admins are um uh district admins have access to this um to looking at, to allocate to actually allocating the licenses. Um schools, teachers principals can look at um their own particular schools um allocation. So you're gonna go to organizations and then click on the um license allocation tab right here. And then you'll see like in the, in this particular one, you have a district total of 200 students, it shows that the district purchased 200 licenses. They've assigned 100 and 40 of them. There's 60 that um are unassigned or floating. So, and then this shows they've been, you know how they, how that pans out how they reserved them and what are unreserved. So let's take a look. Um, a typical, well, and let me talk for a minute too. A typical best practice is for the district admin to assign licenses to each school. Um If not schools can reserve licenses from licenses from the district pool. Um And we've talked about reserved and assigned. So, um here's, here's the, here's the usage rules. The licenses purchased by the school are used first. Next come district reserved licenses. District unreserved. We saw those floating licenses and here's something new that I think everybody um probably is gonna give a cheer about if none of the above licenses are available, an error message will appear when assigning a course to a student. Um What happened um, prior to this, um, this new feature is that you and I've done this myself, I would assign a license to a student for certain, you know, for whatever programs I wanted them to use within the Waterford Reading Academy. And I think, ok, great. And it would just, you know, let me do it. And next day the student would try to access the program and none of their, none of their pro none of their um uh software would be there for them to use. So, um and I didn't know that it was because they didn't have enough licenses. Now, you're gonna know that right away if that's an issue and we, and someone needs to re, you know, reallocate licenses or um purchase uh additional licenses. So I think that everyone will appreciate that. All right, next, coming soon by coming soon, this is set to go a lot, go live on August the 10th. Um, districts are going to be able to create or schools sites create tags for easy grouping and reporting. Um So what is a tag? A tag provides district admins with the ability to create it. And um examples may include, uh you know, your students, you might maybe you wanna um tag and see how all of your students that are in RT I or MTSS are doing. Um, you might want to compare groups um for data. So you can um have the tag for English language learners, you can have ones for special ed head start. And these are just examples you, um, this, excuse me, this particular feature allows you to name name tags, whatever you, you know, choose to do how however you wanna name them. So let's take a look at what that looks like. So, um, we're gonna go to organization tab and then we are going to tag manager and here's where you can add a tag and you just type in whatever name, what, how whatever tag you want to put in there and click on add, you know, click on, add a tag and then save so that I think that is um gonna be very helpful to everyone. Um You also can, um, if you wanna see, you know what a parti how a particular group is doing, this is what it would look like. So you would go to your dashboard and on your dashboard, you would choose um district. And then this particular, this particular example is of early reading. And then as you come down here with the tags, if you got, if you've, you know, enabled the tags, this particular tag would be for head start. So that's, that's how I would filter it. And then when I look across, let's see, see what's going on here. I have surpassing my goal is the green, right? Here. And that means the student is projected to surpass their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the blue on track student is projected to meet their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the pink is where we've taken action. The student is not currently projected to meet their goal, but an but an action plan has been taken by their teacher and Sheila showed us what that action plan looks like. That would be either changing the time um that they're um have access, you know, the the length of their session or adjusting their goal and then need action is the orange. And that means the student is not currently projected to meet their goal and has not been assigned an action plan as of yet by their teacher. So that's, that's what that dashboard is telling you and what it looks like. OK? And then you also can look at um a a student, you know, a tag for by student. So this is an example of that. So here's our student and you look down here and you can see that the student is tagged is, has been given a head start tag. So you can, you know, do groups of students, you can do individual students. OK, let's talk about transferring students within your district. Um A student transfer allows you to determine if their course assignment and associated course data should follow that student to a new school within your district. So, um you'll find this setting. Um and we'll take a look at this in a minute on the district organization level and district admins um can uh give permission for this level setting. So here we go. So here what come back. Sorry, there we go. All right. So transferring student. So this is where you'll find it. You go to organization, you go to settings, student transfer and you'll see down here where it says retain course data when students transfer in the district and then you're just gonna click that box and save and that way um they, you know, say that students going leaving on a Friday um and they're, they're, you know, gonna sink to a new dis new school in the district on Monday. They can go ahead and um start right where they left off. Ok? Sheila is excited. She's gonna acquaint you with some of our brand new help tools. So ready. Yes, I'm ready for that. Um We wanna always make sure you find help when you need help with the program very easily. And so one thing we've added this year is contextual help and that's help that's within the program and they're specific to permissions and where you are in the program. So um when you're in Waterford Reading Academy, you will see a question mark in the lower right hand corner and if you click on that, it's going to come up with articles that would help you where you're at in the program. So, it's kind of thinking ahead of where you might need those, those helps. So, um, if you'll click one more screen, yeah, you'll see that the articles that come up are ones that might be beneficial to you to help you in that, um, area that you are. But always if it's not what you need, you can click the little support button there and the support button will take you right to um speaking with AAA partner um support rep and you just have to choose which department you want. Um add in the questions like the name of your school and district and your name and someone will be on right then and there to talk to you and help you with the, with the problem that you you've encountered. Um Just a reminder that we have lots of different options to help you. We always have our help site at help dot Waterford dot org. Live chat is always available where you can talk to a real person. It's not, it's not a computer. There are real people sitting there to talk with you. Um Tech support for any technical issues is um accessible through. Well support at Waterford dot org. Um Any general support with the program, you would reach out to my team, the partner success team at partner success at Waterford dot org. And if you need any kind of technical help. That's our technical um line. It's 8774997997. But um just as I said earlier, you, you all have a partner, success advocate that is assigned to your account. And that is our number one goal is to help you have a wonderful um implementation this year. So anytime you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us and we're there to help you. Um It's been fun for me to see and chat that a lot of my partners are there. I haven't been able to chat with you because we've been doing this. But I'm excited to get to know you and know that we have direct lines for you to contact us and emails and we're, we're happy to build that relationship with you. All right. This um this concludes our um information we wanted to share with you today and uh we would love um Madison, can you um are there some questions and chat that we need to um address? Yes, I've been writing down some questions. Thank you so much for all of them. Um And thank you to a couple, you know, to everybody else who's been kind of helping me monitor this. Um I wrote the questions down and I'll be repeating them. Um I did not word that correctly. Please message me directly. Um I'm at the Waterford dot org uh user name, so just feel free to send me a message. I'll try my best to get these started. So, um first off, um we are recording this, will all the participants get a copy of this recording? I do believe so. Yes. Ok. Yes. Ok. Another question are some of these activities available on ipads. Yes, they certainly are ipads and Android tablets? Excellent. And can I add one other thing to there, Vicky? Um All, all of our webinars that we've been doing um for this back to school will be in our help dot Waterford dot org site under the getting started hub. So you'll be able to access these webinars to um refresh and share with your staff if they don't, if they don't know some of the new features, they'll be in that um help dot Waterford dot org um site under the Getting started hub. Ok. And since we have a few minutes, I can show that to them. So help dot Waterford dot org. Yep. And if you look in here and you come right down here, help guides. Here's the getting started hub. This is something new. So, um with the help and so we have getting started hub for administrators, students and teachers. So you just click on whichever you know, I'll do for teachers right now. Just fun. And it gives you uh some the basics take you, we'll take you to the places and help where you need to go and where um chili do you know exactly where those, um, I know they're gonna live here. I'm just not sure exactly how they, yeah, I know they're doing that but they'll be able to, with them throughout the year. Um, and that's where they're gonna be. Absolutely. So that's just remember getting started up. That's where you need to go. All right. Um, go ahead, Madison. Ok. Um, and I also, I don't, I just wanted Sheila and Vicky for you guys to know faith how she, when you were playing the song, uh, she noted that her two year old came in to see what she was listening to. So that alone is no. Oh, I love that. That was awesome. I Nicky, they're gonna be singing that all day. Ok. So about the initial assessment, um, would they have access to how their Children perform on the initial assessments? Um, do they, um, I wonder if they mean the wax assessment or the placement test, placement assessment? I'll talk about both. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just talk about both. Um, the wax assessment is a, um, skills check and it's assigned, um, separate from the program. And yes, they, when your child takes wax, your child, your students take, take, takes when they take wax, it takes them about 20 to 30 minutes to, um, complete. Sometimes less, sometimes a little more depending on how well they do because it does adapt um, to where they are. Uh, and those results are available. Um, I do believe immediately under the student, under the student. Um, once they finish. Um, and that's something that we can, you know, help with, with professional services or Sheila's team can help the partner success team can certainly show you where those are as far as the placement, um, results. Um, placement is part of the program for both reading and math and science. Uh They take the students take placement when they first, um, access the program and that is about 10 to 15 minutes and it is seamless for them. Um They, they take placement and then it, the program immediately puts them into the sequence um where they are at where they're, you know, by the results that are indicated. So, um does that um I think that that would answer their questions and maths the same way? Ok. And they can access once they, once they do the assessment that Vicky just talked about, there's a report called the placement report where they can run that and they can see exactly where their student placed um in the sequence. So they get that immediate feedback of where did this student place in, in the Waterford sequence? That's correct. Excellent. Thanks. Shea. And just in case we do not get to all these questions, we're having a lot coming in. I love it. Um Can how do you find out who your support person is? Who do you contact? How do you find out who the person is to contact. If you do have questions. If they just, if you just do an email to partner success at Waterford dot org, we'll respond and let you know who that person is. Excellent. Ok. All right. So moving along, um, what? Ok, let me see. Um, so if you select to report a problem in the middle of doing an activity, what happens to the, to the student's activity? Do you still have to exit or does it do it automatically? That is a good question. That is a great question. And I don't, I don't know because I don't know if it would if usually that's when there's a problem and I imagine it would just go to the next. Can you hear me? OK. The internet, my internet is unstable. Just a second. It's still trying to buffer, let's see, still buffering my apologies. On a side note, I like how it showed how it, how you can find the placement reports. Yes. OK. I'm gonna stop sharing cause we're really at the end of the um the video of the webinar, but I will share the rest of that um with you guys. Um Let me go ahead and, and this, so back to this. So again, I will share this slide um presentation with you all. So do you all have any questions for me that I may be able to answer? If not? OK, we'll keep going. So again, this is where the um the slide presentation will be um with those individual pictures that they had of like the dashboard is gonna also be included in here as well for you. Ok? Um And then I just wanna thank you all for coming um to today's session and here is the little survey if you could fill that out. And if you want, I can put the link and two the chat as well and you can do it from there. But one of the, the, the things that I'm really excited about is um that they listen to the teachers and what they were voicing their concerns about the time. Um And also um one thing that I wanted to do, I want to remind you is that when the student takes the initial placement test, we wanna make sure that we convey uh convey to the caregivers to let that, that child do it independently because if they don't do it independently, um they're gonna go way off the charts and it's not gonna be adapted to their, really, their instructional uh learning. So we wanna make sure that they do that independently. Um And the playlist are gonna be awesome to use with your family and also making sure that you use the um family, family mentoring app, making sure that we are uh intentional about uh including the families and on what the student is learning. Um And I will have some more resources about that as well. Um So I'm gonna stop sharing, stop recording.\"), (477, 503, 3447, \"Ok, good morning. My name is Tracy Gray and I am the support, uh for Waterford curriculum. Um, and I am the pre K through fifth grade instructional coach as well. And I am a reading specialist and I, um, have link my water for office hours. It will be two days a week, Monday and Wednesdays. And, um, it's a calendly link and so you'll just sign up for that if you, um, ever need to come to office hours. Ok. And it is on the F one page. So today, what we're gonna do is we're going to, um, see a, a webinar of what's new for Waterford. Um, and then after that, we'll have a Q and A session, but I'm sure that they're probably going to answer a lot of the questions that you may have, um, on the webinar. But if not, we will address those questions as well. Ok. And again, um, I will have this presentation for you all as well. All right, we're gonna go ahead. Thanks. We are gonna get started. Uh, today we, our topic is what's new in the Waterford Breeding Academy and it's what's new for back to school, um 2020 to 23. I don't know about some of you, but um a lot of the districts that um I work with are already uh either went back this week or starting back next week. So, uh uh we're excited to be able to share this information with you. Uh Your two presenters today will be Sheila Montreat. She's the manager of partners of our partners, success team and myself. I'm Vicky Ross and I'm the VP of Professional Services up here at Waterford. The first thing I'd like to share with you is our mission and we are very um much um committed to family empowerment, equity and universal literacy. And if you would, we would love for you. Um I'll mention this now to engage with us by using um the chat feature within uh Zoom. So uh please put any questions or any comments there. And uh we do have behind the scenes. We have Madison and she will be um monitoring the chat for us so that we can answer questions at the end of our presentation. And um oh, sorry, Vicky, I was gonna turn it over to you. Go ahead, Sheila. So um as Vicky said, my name is Sheila Mont and I'm the manager of the partner success team and this is a picture of all my team members. Um I'm, I'm just want to make sure you're all aware that each partner that we work with is assigned their own partner success advocate to help you through any of your setup, anything you need throughout the year, we're here for you. So, each of us have, um, accounts assigned to us. And if it, during this meeting you don't know who your partner success advocate is. If you put your name and your district in state in the, um, the chat, they'll respond and let you know who they are and we would be happy to reach out and get acquainted. Um But we're there to help you throughout your whole time with Waterford. All right. Um And this is just a quick overview of our agenda today. Um We're so excited about new features that we have for this back to school year. Um We have new functionality. We're gonna share some new resources, some student enhancements and family enhancements as well as new educator tools, administrator tools and then a lot of help tools to help you navigate things throughout the school year. And um Vicky's gonna talk to you about some new functionalities that we have here at Waterford. The main functionality I'm gonna talk to you about today is Waterford Playlists. And in case you're wondering what, what is a playlist? It's a group of digital activities, the they organized into a sequence and they meet the need of a specific learning objective. So think about um a, a play list of songs that you might make in a certain genre. Um a playlist is similar except it is, of course, Waterford activities, digital activities. Um Why would you want to use it um to introduce the concept and to differentiate your instruction um in the classroom? As a side note, uh the new playlist feature in the Waterford Reading Academy does replace um classroom advantage which some of you may be familiar with. So I have exciting news for those of you that are, are administrators that have joined us today. Um You now have access to playlists. Um If you remember those of you that used um the um our legacy manager, you did not have the ability to um you could see playlists. Well, you can't even access them nor could you create them. So now you can, it's unrestricted acce access. Um playlists can be assigned to a group of students um and in or individual learners so, or you can use them um a large group, a whole group. So to locate playlists, what you'll need to do is you will access the resources and activities tab in the Waterford um Reading Academy. And that, that's what that tab looks like right there. And I wanna mention that there are over um 1000, 212 100 playlists that have been Waterford has created for you um within, within this tab on your playlist. So let's take a look at how we're gonna find them. So once you are in the resources and activities, uh tab, you're going to choose, view all activities, you'll see that there and then what you'll do is this little button will pop up and this is where you'll be able to locate all the playlists that are available to you or my playlist, which would be playlists that you would create. So let's talk just for a couple of minutes about the look and feel of that in the Waterford Reading Academy. So under our tips and tricks, you'll notice that this is an example here on the right of what a a sample playlist would look like. Um We recommend that playlist be brief uh five or fewer activities. And you'll see here, we have 12345 activities. Um You want them to be intentional, you want them to include instruction and then you want to include practice for your students. So there's three practice activities here and then it's always a good idea to include some type of an assessment. And um you don't really want to be all over the map with these, you really want them to focus on a specific skill. So if you'll take a good close look at this one, you'll see that this one focuses on the sound P, the letter P. So then you get to decide as a teacher, as an educator, where do you want that playlist to appear? Do you want it before or do you want it after your students regular learning session within Waterford and then you also can decide, do you want them to see it um access immediately or you can assign it to appear on a certain date and you can even have a due date for your playlist. Sheila is now gonna introduce you to some new resources. A sticky. Um One of the things we're really excited about this year is that we're providing you with more math and science resources than we have in the past. So if you want to switch to that next slide, Vicky, there we go. Thank you. Um We've added 100 and 18 basic math and 41 basic science activities and then 62 fluent math and 25 fluent science activities. And all of these are available both in English and Spanish, which will be a huge benefit for teachers to have those already in both languages. Awesome. We also have um refreshed many of our songs and we know that everybody loves the Waterford songs. They get stuck in your head for a long time. Um I love this quote that I just wanted to read out loud to you um regarding windows and mirrors and it says curriculum needs to function both as a window and as a mirror. If the student is understood as occupying a dwelling itself, education needs to enable the student to look through the window frames in order to see the realities of others and into mirrors in order to see his or her own reality reflected. And that's by Emily Seed. And I just, I love that, that our curriculum should show both windows and mirrors to the students. And we have got so many um, new songs that have really updated a lot of our older songs too. Um One of the things that we really love to share is our sing around the world songs. And that's a collection of 27 songs and 23 languages from around the world. And during these songs, the learning goals that we cover are lower case letters, text directionality and we expose learners to all to new cultures and languages. Um One of the questions we're often asked is will they encounter the songs on their own? And the answer is yes, they're built into their adaptive learning path. So the students have the opportunity to encounter them on their own and, and they really love learning these songs and hearing these songs from around the world. Um This next slide shows you an example of one of our old, how the old graphics looks and the new graphics and this is one the painted rooster um which is a song from Argentina and the painted rooster needed new audio. So we partnered with a consultant that was native to Argentina to assess and update the need, the needs to the lyrics and to create new music, the singer in the song. And the song is an Argenti Argentinian teenager and the visuals were inspired by the colorful lively neighborhood of La Boca Argentina. Our team has been thinking about the concept of disability, visibility. And here we found an opportunity to include a person who uses a wheelchair. This clip includes the lyrics in a border frame section where students can practice print directionality skills by following the text on the screen from left to right and top to bottom. And each of our songs around the world contain a frame section like this so they can practice those skills. Um On the next slide, we're gonna let you just see a snippet of one of our songs and this one actually comes from Bangladesh and it has a lovely uh catchy title. It's called Iry, Micky Cham Chicky. So we're gonna let you just listen to see what one of these songs might sound like. Um Chick. He so eating insects. R Sweet. Why Nick Tomar looking for his spot, his Rushing Sea seeing it's too late now. No more. Sing for eating insects. Fall in the rice with the spade. Take a swipe but the blade is too. Plant. Fox is laughing so fun. What you believe? She, we no auntie. T she. Hello. All right. And now Vicky is gonna go over some of the student enhancements with you. All right. The first enhancement I'm gonna speak about is viewing view remaining time in session. We had many educators ask us for this um for this feature because before, you know, you would see your um you either would have no time down here or you would have like the time the initial time in the session. So this um feature allows you to see how much time is left in the daily session. And another great thing is that if the student, the child is interrupted during the session, the next time they log in, they'll resume right where they left off. So I think everyone's gonna really enjoy that, that particular feature. Hey, we have updated our settings on math speed games. This was another um suggestion that um different teachers had let us know that they thought that their students were struggling with the math speed games. So we have added more time for students um to answer individual questions within activities. We have also um added, made sure the students have more over all time to complete the activity itself. Um These adjustments should significantly reduce repetition for these activities. So, um if they don't, please let us know, but um it's been, we've been, we've tested this out and it does seem to be working quite well. So I'm pleased to tell you about that particular um enhancement for our students. I'm now gonna speak to you about um uh one of our family enhancements in the program in the Water for Breeding Academy. We have updated our family math and science learning tips. Um also known as mentor messages. We have reduced the message length, we've definitely improved the formatting and pleased to tell you, we've included um hyperlinks now to activities for the families, for the caregivers. So, and they're available in, in both English and in Spanish. And just as a reminder on Mondays, the message that families receive is personalized to their child's progress in the program. The Wednesday message or nudge is a personalized activities um suggestions based on the child's last mastered skill. So I think it's pretty cool that these are both of these are personalized to their um individual student um or a child fri on Fridays. You also, the families receive a mindset skill activity that they can do with their child such as um they, it might, they're studying the letter B. They uh the nudge could be, hey um over the weekend, why don't you um if you're going to the grocery, have your student point out things that start would be and all of the activities that we suggest are um designed to be done um quickly and to involve both the caregiver and their child. And we really are trying to be really aware of not um suggesting things that um have a cost associated with them. So I think that's pretty cool. Sheila will now present you some very exciting new educator tools. Yes, we love um We love getting feedback and we try to always improve, to address the things that you would, you would like to see in our program. So one of the things that, that we've improved on is being able to see the student progress toward their end of the year goal. Um, to view course enrollment at a glance and to report a problem when there's a problem with, um, the system. So when you first log into the dashboards, um, you will see that there's this new feature that green line there with the, with the green star that is showing where your students um goal is. And if um so that you can see how close they are to reaching that goal, that's a new edition this year. And I think that's a great addition. So you get a quick glance to see how close are they to reaching their goal. Um Also you will see the percentage of the students goal, not their course completion. So you can see that um Athena there is at 100 and 43% of her goal. So definitely surpassing her goal there. Yep, another thing you're able to do from, from this page is you can adjust the students goal if their goal was a little too. Um You need to make it a little bit more attainable for them. You can adjust it by just clicking on those three lines there and you can adjust the goal from this dashboard screen, which is an awesome feature. Um Next, we have a way for you to quickly see which courses your students are enrolled at, at a glance. So if you're on the view, if you make sure you're on the student view and in the course and goals tab of Waterford Reading Academy, you can see all of the courses are assigned. And then if you click on a specific student, you can then go in and adjust if you need to adjust how many minutes they're using, or if you need to adjust how many days they use or their goal, you can do it there at that, at that point as well. So those features make it a really quick for teachers to just adjust those student learning goals. Um On that next slide, um there are so many different um devices that we that schools use that sometimes things don't work as expected. And so um to make it easier for you to and to let us know when you run into hiccups, we've added a way to capture the information that we need in order to troubleshoot. So for example, if you came up to a problem that there was something wrong with your students um devices they were using. If you click on that little gear up in the right hand corner, you'll be given this little math problem to solve. Um the reason it's a math problem and not just a button and Children are very smart and they can click, they figure out ways to get around systems. And so instead of it just being a button. It's a math problem. And most pre K to two year olds are, are too second graders aren't gonna be able to solve that problem. So if you, um, once that comes up, you will get a problem, you'll type in the numerical answer and then once that comes up, you'll have the option of either exiting the program, skipping, restarting or reporting a problem. So, um, if you click or tap restart, it's going to restart the activity only and not the session time, the session time will still be the same. So that's a really good addition to, to what has been in the past. Also, if you were to click, continue when choosing restart, a message gonna be automatically sent to Waterford, that will report the problem so that they can track and monitor it. So you won't have to take time from your teaching to write down which device it was. Um what exactly was happening. It will just send that information to Waterford directly so we can track that problem for you. And then if you click, um skip that will of course, skip the activity, but we really want to caution you not to use that regularly. Um That's just if there's a, a problem where it's stuck, um Go ahead and skip the activity but that shouldn't be used um Unless it was really necessary. Um And that, um I'll turn the time back over to Vicky to go through some of the admin tools that we've added. All right, thanks. I'm excited about this. Um The reporter problem gonna make a huge, huge difference. No more screenshots. No more, you know, interrupting your time. I love it. Sheila, thanks. So we're gonna talk about some new admin tools. Uh We have new managed licenses more efficiently. Uh We're now able to um and have you, you can tag your students for easy grouping and reporting and you can transfer students now within your district, not just school. And I think that's a real um value add right there too. So managing your license, let's talk a little bit about this. Um You are able to assign licenses to the schools within your district. Um District purchase versus school purchase licenses. And what that means is many times a district will purchase um a certain number of licenses and then a school will say, well, gosh, I really wanna use this with another grade level. So, but now I have some money. So I'm gonna, I wanna get licenses also. So we're now able to differentiate between the two so that you can access district licenses and you'll see how your the school purchase licenses and um they're just available to your, your particular site. Um You will also now be able to monitor your license allocation. Uh You'll see how many licenses are purchased, how many license are reserved for each school versus unreserved and the number of licenses assigned to students versus unassigned within each school. So let's see what that looks like. So, um this is what the new license allocation looks like. Um Admins are um uh district admins have access to this um to looking at, to allocate to actually allocating the licenses. Um schools, teachers principals can look at um their own particular schools um allocation. So you're gonna go to organizations and then click on the um license allocation tab right here. And then you'll see like in the, in this particular one, you have a district total of 200 students, it shows that the district purchased 200 licenses. They've assigned 100 and 40 of them. There's 60 that um are unassigned or floating. So, and then this shows they've been, you know how they, how that pans out how they reserved them and what are unreserved. So let's take a look. Um, a typical, well, and let me talk for a minute too. A typical best practice is for the district admin to assign licenses to each school. Um If not schools can reserve licenses from licenses from the district pool. Um And we've talked about reserved and assigned. So, um here's, here's the, here's the usage rules. The licenses purchased by the school are used first. Next come district reserved licenses. District unreserved. We saw those floating licenses and here's something new that I think everybody um probably is gonna give a cheer about if none of the above licenses are available, an error message will appear when assigning a course to a student. Um What happened um, prior to this, um, this new feature is that you and I've done this myself, I would assign a license to a student for certain, you know, for whatever programs I wanted them to use within the Waterford Reading Academy. And I think, ok, great. And it would just, you know, let me do it. And next day the student would try to access the program and none of their, none of their pro none of their um uh software would be there for them to use. So, um and I didn't know that it was because they didn't have enough licenses. Now, you're gonna know that right away if that's an issue and we, and someone needs to re, you know, reallocate licenses or um purchase uh additional licenses. So I think that everyone will appreciate that. All right, next, coming soon by coming soon, this is set to go a lot, go live on August the 10th. Um, districts are going to be able to create or schools sites create tags for easy grouping and reporting. Um So what is a tag? A tag provides district admins with the ability to create it. And um examples may include, uh you know, your students, you might maybe you wanna um tag and see how all of your students that are in RT I or MTSS are doing. Um, you might want to compare groups um for data. So you can um have the tag for English language learners, you can have ones for special ed head start. And these are just examples you, um, this, excuse me, this particular feature allows you to name name tags, whatever you, you know, choose to do how however you wanna name them. So let's take a look at what that looks like. So, um, we're gonna go to organization tab and then we are going to tag manager and here's where you can add a tag and you just type in whatever name, what, how whatever tag you want to put in there and click on add, you know, click on, add a tag and then save so that I think that is um gonna be very helpful to everyone. Um You also can, um, if you wanna see, you know what a parti how a particular group is doing, this is what it would look like. So you would go to your dashboard and on your dashboard, you would choose um district. And then this particular, this particular example is of early reading. And then as you come down here with the tags, if you got, if you've, you know, enabled the tags, this particular tag would be for head start. So that's, that's how I would filter it. And then when I look across, let's see, see what's going on here. I have surpassing my goal is the green, right? Here. And that means the student is projected to surpass their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the blue on track student is projected to meet their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the pink is where we've taken action. The student is not currently projected to meet their goal, but an but an action plan has been taken by their teacher and Sheila showed us what that action plan looks like. That would be either changing the time um that they're um have access, you know, the the length of their session or adjusting their goal and then need action is the orange. And that means the student is not currently projected to meet their goal and has not been assigned an action plan as of yet by their teacher. So that's, that's what that dashboard is telling you and what it looks like. OK? And then you also can look at um a a student, you know, a tag for by student. So this is an example of that. So here's our student and you look down here and you can see that the student is tagged is, has been given a head start tag. So you can, you know, do groups of students, you can do individual students. OK, let's talk about transferring students within your district. Um A student transfer allows you to determine if their course assignment and associated course data should follow that student to a new school within your district. So, um you'll find this setting. Um and we'll take a look at this in a minute on the district organization level and district admins um can uh give permission for this level setting. So here we go. So here what come back. Sorry, there we go. All right. So transferring student. So this is where you'll find it. You go to organization, you go to settings, student transfer and you'll see down here where it says retain course data when students transfer in the district and then you're just gonna click that box and save and that way um they, you know, say that students going leaving on a Friday um and they're, they're, you know, gonna sink to a new dis new school in the district on Monday. They can go ahead and um start right where they left off. Ok? Sheila is excited. She's gonna acquaint you with some of our brand new help tools. So ready. Yes, I'm ready for that. Um We wanna always make sure you find help when you need help with the program very easily. And so one thing we've added this year is contextual help and that's help that's within the program and they're specific to permissions and where you are in the program. So um when you're in Waterford Reading Academy, you will see a question mark in the lower right hand corner and if you click on that, it's going to come up with articles that would help you where you're at in the program. So, it's kind of thinking ahead of where you might need those, those helps. So, um, if you'll click one more screen, yeah, you'll see that the articles that come up are ones that might be beneficial to you to help you in that, um, area that you are. But always if it's not what you need, you can click the little support button there and the support button will take you right to um speaking with AAA partner um support rep and you just have to choose which department you want. Um add in the questions like the name of your school and district and your name and someone will be on right then and there to talk to you and help you with the, with the problem that you you've encountered. Um Just a reminder that we have lots of different options to help you. We always have our help site at help dot Waterford dot org. Live chat is always available where you can talk to a real person. It's not, it's not a computer. There are real people sitting there to talk with you. Um Tech support for any technical issues is um accessible through. Well support at Waterford dot org. Um Any general support with the program, you would reach out to my team, the partner success team at partner success at Waterford dot org. And if you need any kind of technical help. That's our technical um line. It's 8774997997. But um just as I said earlier, you, you all have a partner, success advocate that is assigned to your account. And that is our number one goal is to help you have a wonderful um implementation this year. So anytime you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us and we're there to help you. Um It's been fun for me to see and chat that a lot of my partners are there. I haven't been able to chat with you because we've been doing this. But I'm excited to get to know you and know that we have direct lines for you to contact us and emails and we're, we're happy to build that relationship with you. All right. This um this concludes our um information we wanted to share with you today and uh we would love um Madison, can you um are there some questions and chat that we need to um address? Yes, I've been writing down some questions. Thank you so much for all of them. Um And thank you to a couple, you know, to everybody else who's been kind of helping me monitor this. Um I wrote the questions down and I'll be repeating them. Um I did not word that correctly. Please message me directly. Um I'm at the Waterford dot org uh user name, so just feel free to send me a message. I'll try my best to get these started. So, um first off, um we are recording this, will all the participants get a copy of this recording? I do believe so. Yes. Ok. Yes. Ok. Another question are some of these activities available on ipads. Yes, they certainly are ipads and Android tablets? Excellent. And can I add one other thing to there, Vicky? Um All, all of our webinars that we've been doing um for this back to school will be in our help dot Waterford dot org site under the getting started hub. So you'll be able to access these webinars to um refresh and share with your staff if they don't, if they don't know some of the new features, they'll be in that um help dot Waterford dot org um site under the Getting started hub. Ok. And since we have a few minutes, I can show that to them. So help dot Waterford dot org. Yep. And if you look in here and you come right down here, help guides. Here's the getting started hub. This is something new. So, um with the help and so we have getting started hub for administrators, students and teachers. So you just click on whichever you know, I'll do for teachers right now. Just fun. And it gives you uh some the basics take you, we'll take you to the places and help where you need to go and where um chili do you know exactly where those, um, I know they're gonna live here. I'm just not sure exactly how they, yeah, I know they're doing that but they'll be able to, with them throughout the year. Um, and that's where they're gonna be. Absolutely. So that's just remember getting started up. That's where you need to go. All right. Um, go ahead, Madison. Ok. Um, and I also, I don't, I just wanted Sheila and Vicky for you guys to know faith how she, when you were playing the song, uh, she noted that her two year old came in to see what she was listening to. So that alone is no. Oh, I love that. That was awesome. I Nicky, they're gonna be singing that all day. Ok. So about the initial assessment, um, would they have access to how their Children perform on the initial assessments? Um, do they, um, I wonder if they mean the wax assessment or the placement test, placement assessment? I'll talk about both. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just talk about both. Um, the wax assessment is a, um, skills check and it's assigned, um, separate from the program. And yes, they, when your child takes wax, your child, your students take, take, takes when they take wax, it takes them about 20 to 30 minutes to, um, complete. Sometimes less, sometimes a little more depending on how well they do because it does adapt um, to where they are. Uh, and those results are available. Um, I do believe immediately under the student, under the student. Um, once they finish. Um, and that's something that we can, you know, help with, with professional services or Sheila's team can help the partner success team can certainly show you where those are as far as the placement, um, results. Um, placement is part of the program for both reading and math and science. Uh They take the students take placement when they first, um, access the program and that is about 10 to 15 minutes and it is seamless for them. Um They, they take placement and then it, the program immediately puts them into the sequence um where they are at where they're, you know, by the results that are indicated. So, um does that um I think that that would answer their questions and maths the same way? Ok. And they can access once they, once they do the assessment that Vicky just talked about, there's a report called the placement report where they can run that and they can see exactly where their student placed um in the sequence. So they get that immediate feedback of where did this student place in, in the Waterford sequence? That's correct. Excellent. Thanks. Shea. And just in case we do not get to all these questions, we're having a lot coming in. I love it. Um Can how do you find out who your support person is? Who do you contact? How do you find out who the person is to contact. If you do have questions. If they just, if you just do an email to partner success at Waterford dot org, we'll respond and let you know who that person is. Excellent. Ok. All right. So moving along, um, what? Ok, let me see. Um, so if you select to report a problem in the middle of doing an activity, what happens to the, to the student's activity? Do you still have to exit or does it do it automatically? That is a good question. That is a great question. And I don't, I don't know because I don't know if it would if usually that's when there's a problem and I imagine it would just go to the next. Can you hear me? OK. The internet, my internet is unstable. Just a second. It's still trying to buffer, let's see, still buffering my apologies. On a side note, I like how it showed how it, how you can find the placement reports. Yes. OK. I'm gonna stop sharing cause we're really at the end of the um the video of the webinar, but I will share the rest of that um with you guys. Um Let me go ahead and, and this, so back to this. So again, I will share this slide um presentation with you all. So do you all have any questions for me that I may be able to answer? If not? OK, we'll keep going. So again, this is where the um the slide presentation will be um with those individual pictures that they had of like the dashboard is gonna also be included in here as well for you. Ok? Um And then I just wanna thank you all for coming um to today's session and here is the little survey if you could fill that out. And if you want, I can put the link and two the chat as well and you can do it from there. But one of the, the, the things that I'm really excited about is um that they listen to the teachers and what they were voicing their concerns about the time. Um And also um one thing that I wanted to do, I want to remind you is that when the student takes the initial placement test, we wanna make sure that we convey uh convey to the caregivers to let that, that child do it independently because if they don't do it independently, um they're gonna go way off the charts and it's not gonna be adapted to their, really, their instructional uh learning. So we wanna make sure that they do that independently. Um And the playlist are gonna be awesome to use with your family and also making sure that you use the um family, family mentoring app, making sure that we are uh intentional about uh including the families and on what the student is learning. Um And I will have some more resources about that as well. Um So I'm gonna stop sharing, stop recording.\"), (533, 503, 3447, \"Ok, good morning. My name is Tracy Gray and I am the support, uh for Waterford curriculum. Um, and I am the pre K through fifth grade instructional coach as well. And I am a reading specialist and I, um, have link my water for office hours. It will be two days a week, Monday and Wednesdays. And, um, it's a calendly link and so you'll just sign up for that if you, um, ever need to come to office hours. Ok. And it is on the F one page. So today, what we're gonna do is we're going to, um, see a, a webinar of what's new for Waterford. Um, and then after that, we'll have a Q and A session, but I'm sure that they're probably going to answer a lot of the questions that you may have, um, on the webinar. But if not, we will address those questions as well. Ok. And again, um, I will have this presentation for you all as well. All right, we're gonna go ahead. Thanks. We are gonna get started. Uh, today we, our topic is what's new in the Waterford Breeding Academy and it's what's new for back to school, um 2020 to 23. I don't know about some of you, but um a lot of the districts that um I work with are already uh either went back this week or starting back next week. So, uh uh we're excited to be able to share this information with you. Uh Your two presenters today will be Sheila Montreat. She's the manager of partners of our partners, success team and myself. I'm Vicky Ross and I'm the VP of Professional Services up here at Waterford. The first thing I'd like to share with you is our mission and we are very um much um committed to family empowerment, equity and universal literacy. And if you would, we would love for you. Um I'll mention this now to engage with us by using um the chat feature within uh Zoom. So uh please put any questions or any comments there. And uh we do have behind the scenes. We have Madison and she will be um monitoring the chat for us so that we can answer questions at the end of our presentation. And um oh, sorry, Vicky, I was gonna turn it over to you. Go ahead, Sheila. So um as Vicky said, my name is Sheila Mont and I'm the manager of the partner success team and this is a picture of all my team members. Um I'm, I'm just want to make sure you're all aware that each partner that we work with is assigned their own partner success advocate to help you through any of your setup, anything you need throughout the year, we're here for you. So, each of us have, um, accounts assigned to us. And if it, during this meeting you don't know who your partner success advocate is. If you put your name and your district in state in the, um, the chat, they'll respond and let you know who they are and we would be happy to reach out and get acquainted. Um But we're there to help you throughout your whole time with Waterford. All right. Um And this is just a quick overview of our agenda today. Um We're so excited about new features that we have for this back to school year. Um We have new functionality. We're gonna share some new resources, some student enhancements and family enhancements as well as new educator tools, administrator tools and then a lot of help tools to help you navigate things throughout the school year. And um Vicky's gonna talk to you about some new functionalities that we have here at Waterford. The main functionality I'm gonna talk to you about today is Waterford Playlists. And in case you're wondering what, what is a playlist? It's a group of digital activities, the they organized into a sequence and they meet the need of a specific learning objective. So think about um a, a play list of songs that you might make in a certain genre. Um a playlist is similar except it is, of course, Waterford activities, digital activities. Um Why would you want to use it um to introduce the concept and to differentiate your instruction um in the classroom? As a side note, uh the new playlist feature in the Waterford Reading Academy does replace um classroom advantage which some of you may be familiar with. So I have exciting news for those of you that are, are administrators that have joined us today. Um You now have access to playlists. Um If you remember those of you that used um the um our legacy manager, you did not have the ability to um you could see playlists. Well, you can't even access them nor could you create them. So now you can, it's unrestricted acce access. Um playlists can be assigned to a group of students um and in or individual learners so, or you can use them um a large group, a whole group. So to locate playlists, what you'll need to do is you will access the resources and activities tab in the Waterford um Reading Academy. And that, that's what that tab looks like right there. And I wanna mention that there are over um 1000, 212 100 playlists that have been Waterford has created for you um within, within this tab on your playlist. So let's take a look at how we're gonna find them. So once you are in the resources and activities, uh tab, you're going to choose, view all activities, you'll see that there and then what you'll do is this little button will pop up and this is where you'll be able to locate all the playlists that are available to you or my playlist, which would be playlists that you would create. So let's talk just for a couple of minutes about the look and feel of that in the Waterford Reading Academy. So under our tips and tricks, you'll notice that this is an example here on the right of what a a sample playlist would look like. Um We recommend that playlist be brief uh five or fewer activities. And you'll see here, we have 12345 activities. Um You want them to be intentional, you want them to include instruction and then you want to include practice for your students. So there's three practice activities here and then it's always a good idea to include some type of an assessment. And um you don't really want to be all over the map with these, you really want them to focus on a specific skill. So if you'll take a good close look at this one, you'll see that this one focuses on the sound P, the letter P. So then you get to decide as a teacher, as an educator, where do you want that playlist to appear? Do you want it before or do you want it after your students regular learning session within Waterford and then you also can decide, do you want them to see it um access immediately or you can assign it to appear on a certain date and you can even have a due date for your playlist. Sheila is now gonna introduce you to some new resources. A sticky. Um One of the things we're really excited about this year is that we're providing you with more math and science resources than we have in the past. So if you want to switch to that next slide, Vicky, there we go. Thank you. Um We've added 100 and 18 basic math and 41 basic science activities and then 62 fluent math and 25 fluent science activities. And all of these are available both in English and Spanish, which will be a huge benefit for teachers to have those already in both languages. Awesome. We also have um refreshed many of our songs and we know that everybody loves the Waterford songs. They get stuck in your head for a long time. Um I love this quote that I just wanted to read out loud to you um regarding windows and mirrors and it says curriculum needs to function both as a window and as a mirror. If the student is understood as occupying a dwelling itself, education needs to enable the student to look through the window frames in order to see the realities of others and into mirrors in order to see his or her own reality reflected. And that's by Emily Seed. And I just, I love that, that our curriculum should show both windows and mirrors to the students. And we have got so many um, new songs that have really updated a lot of our older songs too. Um One of the things that we really love to share is our sing around the world songs. And that's a collection of 27 songs and 23 languages from around the world. And during these songs, the learning goals that we cover are lower case letters, text directionality and we expose learners to all to new cultures and languages. Um One of the questions we're often asked is will they encounter the songs on their own? And the answer is yes, they're built into their adaptive learning path. So the students have the opportunity to encounter them on their own and, and they really love learning these songs and hearing these songs from around the world. Um This next slide shows you an example of one of our old, how the old graphics looks and the new graphics and this is one the painted rooster um which is a song from Argentina and the painted rooster needed new audio. So we partnered with a consultant that was native to Argentina to assess and update the need, the needs to the lyrics and to create new music, the singer in the song. And the song is an Argenti Argentinian teenager and the visuals were inspired by the colorful lively neighborhood of La Boca Argentina. Our team has been thinking about the concept of disability, visibility. And here we found an opportunity to include a person who uses a wheelchair. This clip includes the lyrics in a border frame section where students can practice print directionality skills by following the text on the screen from left to right and top to bottom. And each of our songs around the world contain a frame section like this so they can practice those skills. Um On the next slide, we're gonna let you just see a snippet of one of our songs and this one actually comes from Bangladesh and it has a lovely uh catchy title. It's called Iry, Micky Cham Chicky. So we're gonna let you just listen to see what one of these songs might sound like. Um Chick. He so eating insects. R Sweet. Why Nick Tomar looking for his spot, his Rushing Sea seeing it's too late now. No more. Sing for eating insects. Fall in the rice with the spade. Take a swipe but the blade is too. Plant. Fox is laughing so fun. What you believe? She, we no auntie. T she. Hello. All right. And now Vicky is gonna go over some of the student enhancements with you. All right. The first enhancement I'm gonna speak about is viewing view remaining time in session. We had many educators ask us for this um for this feature because before, you know, you would see your um you either would have no time down here or you would have like the time the initial time in the session. So this um feature allows you to see how much time is left in the daily session. And another great thing is that if the student, the child is interrupted during the session, the next time they log in, they'll resume right where they left off. So I think everyone's gonna really enjoy that, that particular feature. Hey, we have updated our settings on math speed games. This was another um suggestion that um different teachers had let us know that they thought that their students were struggling with the math speed games. So we have added more time for students um to answer individual questions within activities. We have also um added, made sure the students have more over all time to complete the activity itself. Um These adjustments should significantly reduce repetition for these activities. So, um if they don't, please let us know, but um it's been, we've been, we've tested this out and it does seem to be working quite well. So I'm pleased to tell you about that particular um enhancement for our students. I'm now gonna speak to you about um uh one of our family enhancements in the program in the Water for Breeding Academy. We have updated our family math and science learning tips. Um also known as mentor messages. We have reduced the message length, we've definitely improved the formatting and pleased to tell you, we've included um hyperlinks now to activities for the families, for the caregivers. So, and they're available in, in both English and in Spanish. And just as a reminder on Mondays, the message that families receive is personalized to their child's progress in the program. The Wednesday message or nudge is a personalized activities um suggestions based on the child's last mastered skill. So I think it's pretty cool that these are both of these are personalized to their um individual student um or a child fri on Fridays. You also, the families receive a mindset skill activity that they can do with their child such as um they, it might, they're studying the letter B. They uh the nudge could be, hey um over the weekend, why don't you um if you're going to the grocery, have your student point out things that start would be and all of the activities that we suggest are um designed to be done um quickly and to involve both the caregiver and their child. And we really are trying to be really aware of not um suggesting things that um have a cost associated with them. So I think that's pretty cool. Sheila will now present you some very exciting new educator tools. Yes, we love um We love getting feedback and we try to always improve, to address the things that you would, you would like to see in our program. So one of the things that, that we've improved on is being able to see the student progress toward their end of the year goal. Um, to view course enrollment at a glance and to report a problem when there's a problem with, um, the system. So when you first log into the dashboards, um, you will see that there's this new feature that green line there with the, with the green star that is showing where your students um goal is. And if um so that you can see how close they are to reaching that goal, that's a new edition this year. And I think that's a great addition. So you get a quick glance to see how close are they to reaching their goal. Um Also you will see the percentage of the students goal, not their course completion. So you can see that um Athena there is at 100 and 43% of her goal. So definitely surpassing her goal there. Yep, another thing you're able to do from, from this page is you can adjust the students goal if their goal was a little too. Um You need to make it a little bit more attainable for them. You can adjust it by just clicking on those three lines there and you can adjust the goal from this dashboard screen, which is an awesome feature. Um Next, we have a way for you to quickly see which courses your students are enrolled at, at a glance. So if you're on the view, if you make sure you're on the student view and in the course and goals tab of Waterford Reading Academy, you can see all of the courses are assigned. And then if you click on a specific student, you can then go in and adjust if you need to adjust how many minutes they're using, or if you need to adjust how many days they use or their goal, you can do it there at that, at that point as well. So those features make it a really quick for teachers to just adjust those student learning goals. Um On that next slide, um there are so many different um devices that we that schools use that sometimes things don't work as expected. And so um to make it easier for you to and to let us know when you run into hiccups, we've added a way to capture the information that we need in order to troubleshoot. So for example, if you came up to a problem that there was something wrong with your students um devices they were using. If you click on that little gear up in the right hand corner, you'll be given this little math problem to solve. Um the reason it's a math problem and not just a button and Children are very smart and they can click, they figure out ways to get around systems. And so instead of it just being a button. It's a math problem. And most pre K to two year olds are, are too second graders aren't gonna be able to solve that problem. So if you, um, once that comes up, you will get a problem, you'll type in the numerical answer and then once that comes up, you'll have the option of either exiting the program, skipping, restarting or reporting a problem. So, um, if you click or tap restart, it's going to restart the activity only and not the session time, the session time will still be the same. So that's a really good addition to, to what has been in the past. Also, if you were to click, continue when choosing restart, a message gonna be automatically sent to Waterford, that will report the problem so that they can track and monitor it. So you won't have to take time from your teaching to write down which device it was. Um what exactly was happening. It will just send that information to Waterford directly so we can track that problem for you. And then if you click, um skip that will of course, skip the activity, but we really want to caution you not to use that regularly. Um That's just if there's a, a problem where it's stuck, um Go ahead and skip the activity but that shouldn't be used um Unless it was really necessary. Um And that, um I'll turn the time back over to Vicky to go through some of the admin tools that we've added. All right, thanks. I'm excited about this. Um The reporter problem gonna make a huge, huge difference. No more screenshots. No more, you know, interrupting your time. I love it. Sheila, thanks. So we're gonna talk about some new admin tools. Uh We have new managed licenses more efficiently. Uh We're now able to um and have you, you can tag your students for easy grouping and reporting and you can transfer students now within your district, not just school. And I think that's a real um value add right there too. So managing your license, let's talk a little bit about this. Um You are able to assign licenses to the schools within your district. Um District purchase versus school purchase licenses. And what that means is many times a district will purchase um a certain number of licenses and then a school will say, well, gosh, I really wanna use this with another grade level. So, but now I have some money. So I'm gonna, I wanna get licenses also. So we're now able to differentiate between the two so that you can access district licenses and you'll see how your the school purchase licenses and um they're just available to your, your particular site. Um You will also now be able to monitor your license allocation. Uh You'll see how many licenses are purchased, how many license are reserved for each school versus unreserved and the number of licenses assigned to students versus unassigned within each school. So let's see what that looks like. So, um this is what the new license allocation looks like. Um Admins are um uh district admins have access to this um to looking at, to allocate to actually allocating the licenses. Um schools, teachers principals can look at um their own particular schools um allocation. So you're gonna go to organizations and then click on the um license allocation tab right here. And then you'll see like in the, in this particular one, you have a district total of 200 students, it shows that the district purchased 200 licenses. They've assigned 100 and 40 of them. There's 60 that um are unassigned or floating. So, and then this shows they've been, you know how they, how that pans out how they reserved them and what are unreserved. So let's take a look. Um, a typical, well, and let me talk for a minute too. A typical best practice is for the district admin to assign licenses to each school. Um If not schools can reserve licenses from licenses from the district pool. Um And we've talked about reserved and assigned. So, um here's, here's the, here's the usage rules. The licenses purchased by the school are used first. Next come district reserved licenses. District unreserved. We saw those floating licenses and here's something new that I think everybody um probably is gonna give a cheer about if none of the above licenses are available, an error message will appear when assigning a course to a student. Um What happened um, prior to this, um, this new feature is that you and I've done this myself, I would assign a license to a student for certain, you know, for whatever programs I wanted them to use within the Waterford Reading Academy. And I think, ok, great. And it would just, you know, let me do it. And next day the student would try to access the program and none of their, none of their pro none of their um uh software would be there for them to use. So, um and I didn't know that it was because they didn't have enough licenses. Now, you're gonna know that right away if that's an issue and we, and someone needs to re, you know, reallocate licenses or um purchase uh additional licenses. So I think that everyone will appreciate that. All right, next, coming soon by coming soon, this is set to go a lot, go live on August the 10th. Um, districts are going to be able to create or schools sites create tags for easy grouping and reporting. Um So what is a tag? A tag provides district admins with the ability to create it. And um examples may include, uh you know, your students, you might maybe you wanna um tag and see how all of your students that are in RT I or MTSS are doing. Um, you might want to compare groups um for data. So you can um have the tag for English language learners, you can have ones for special ed head start. And these are just examples you, um, this, excuse me, this particular feature allows you to name name tags, whatever you, you know, choose to do how however you wanna name them. So let's take a look at what that looks like. So, um, we're gonna go to organization tab and then we are going to tag manager and here's where you can add a tag and you just type in whatever name, what, how whatever tag you want to put in there and click on add, you know, click on, add a tag and then save so that I think that is um gonna be very helpful to everyone. Um You also can, um, if you wanna see, you know what a parti how a particular group is doing, this is what it would look like. So you would go to your dashboard and on your dashboard, you would choose um district. And then this particular, this particular example is of early reading. And then as you come down here with the tags, if you got, if you've, you know, enabled the tags, this particular tag would be for head start. So that's, that's how I would filter it. And then when I look across, let's see, see what's going on here. I have surpassing my goal is the green, right? Here. And that means the student is projected to surpass their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the blue on track student is projected to meet their project goal by the end of the school term. And then the pink is where we've taken action. The student is not currently projected to meet their goal, but an but an action plan has been taken by their teacher and Sheila showed us what that action plan looks like. That would be either changing the time um that they're um have access, you know, the the length of their session or adjusting their goal and then need action is the orange. And that means the student is not currently projected to meet their goal and has not been assigned an action plan as of yet by their teacher. So that's, that's what that dashboard is telling you and what it looks like. OK? And then you also can look at um a a student, you know, a tag for by student. So this is an example of that. So here's our student and you look down here and you can see that the student is tagged is, has been given a head start tag. So you can, you know, do groups of students, you can do individual students. OK, let's talk about transferring students within your district. Um A student transfer allows you to determine if their course assignment and associated course data should follow that student to a new school within your district. So, um you'll find this setting. Um and we'll take a look at this in a minute on the district organization level and district admins um can uh give permission for this level setting. So here we go. So here what come back. Sorry, there we go. All right. So transferring student. So this is where you'll find it. You go to organization, you go to settings, student transfer and you'll see down here where it says retain course data when students transfer in the district and then you're just gonna click that box and save and that way um they, you know, say that students going leaving on a Friday um and they're, they're, you know, gonna sink to a new dis new school in the district on Monday. They can go ahead and um start right where they left off. Ok? Sheila is excited. She's gonna acquaint you with some of our brand new help tools. So ready. Yes, I'm ready for that. Um We wanna always make sure you find help when you need help with the program very easily. And so one thing we've added this year is contextual help and that's help that's within the program and they're specific to permissions and where you are in the program. So um when you're in Waterford Reading Academy, you will see a question mark in the lower right hand corner and if you click on that, it's going to come up with articles that would help you where you're at in the program. So, it's kind of thinking ahead of where you might need those, those helps. So, um, if you'll click one more screen, yeah, you'll see that the articles that come up are ones that might be beneficial to you to help you in that, um, area that you are. But always if it's not what you need, you can click the little support button there and the support button will take you right to um speaking with AAA partner um support rep and you just have to choose which department you want. Um add in the questions like the name of your school and district and your name and someone will be on right then and there to talk to you and help you with the, with the problem that you you've encountered. Um Just a reminder that we have lots of different options to help you. We always have our help site at help dot Waterford dot org. Live chat is always available where you can talk to a real person. It's not, it's not a computer. There are real people sitting there to talk with you. Um Tech support for any technical issues is um accessible through. Well support at Waterford dot org. Um Any general support with the program, you would reach out to my team, the partner success team at partner success at Waterford dot org. And if you need any kind of technical help. That's our technical um line. It's 8774997997. But um just as I said earlier, you, you all have a partner, success advocate that is assigned to your account. And that is our number one goal is to help you have a wonderful um implementation this year. So anytime you have any questions or concerns, reach out to us and we're there to help you. Um It's been fun for me to see and chat that a lot of my partners are there. I haven't been able to chat with you because we've been doing this. But I'm excited to get to know you and know that we have direct lines for you to contact us and emails and we're, we're happy to build that relationship with you. All right. This um this concludes our um information we wanted to share with you today and uh we would love um Madison, can you um are there some questions and chat that we need to um address? Yes, I've been writing down some questions. Thank you so much for all of them. Um And thank you to a couple, you know, to everybody else who's been kind of helping me monitor this. Um I wrote the questions down and I'll be repeating them. Um I did not word that correctly. Please message me directly. Um I'm at the Waterford dot org uh user name, so just feel free to send me a message. I'll try my best to get these started. So, um first off, um we are recording this, will all the participants get a copy of this recording? I do believe so. Yes. Ok. Yes. Ok. Another question are some of these activities available on ipads. Yes, they certainly are ipads and Android tablets? Excellent. And can I add one other thing to there, Vicky? Um All, all of our webinars that we've been doing um for this back to school will be in our help dot Waterford dot org site under the getting started hub. So you'll be able to access these webinars to um refresh and share with your staff if they don't, if they don't know some of the new features, they'll be in that um help dot Waterford dot org um site under the Getting started hub. Ok. And since we have a few minutes, I can show that to them. So help dot Waterford dot org. Yep. And if you look in here and you come right down here, help guides. Here's the getting started hub. This is something new. So, um with the help and so we have getting started hub for administrators, students and teachers. So you just click on whichever you know, I'll do for teachers right now. Just fun. And it gives you uh some the basics take you, we'll take you to the places and help where you need to go and where um chili do you know exactly where those, um, I know they're gonna live here. I'm just not sure exactly how they, yeah, I know they're doing that but they'll be able to, with them throughout the year. Um, and that's where they're gonna be. Absolutely. So that's just remember getting started up. That's where you need to go. All right. Um, go ahead, Madison. Ok. Um, and I also, I don't, I just wanted Sheila and Vicky for you guys to know faith how she, when you were playing the song, uh, she noted that her two year old came in to see what she was listening to. So that alone is no. Oh, I love that. That was awesome. I Nicky, they're gonna be singing that all day. Ok. So about the initial assessment, um, would they have access to how their Children perform on the initial assessments? Um, do they, um, I wonder if they mean the wax assessment or the placement test, placement assessment? I'll talk about both. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just talk about both. Um, the wax assessment is a, um, skills check and it's assigned, um, separate from the program. And yes, they, when your child takes wax, your child, your students take, take, takes when they take wax, it takes them about 20 to 30 minutes to, um, complete. Sometimes less, sometimes a little more depending on how well they do because it does adapt um, to where they are. Uh, and those results are available. Um, I do believe immediately under the student, under the student. Um, once they finish. Um, and that's something that we can, you know, help with, with professional services or Sheila's team can help the partner success team can certainly show you where those are as far as the placement, um, results. Um, placement is part of the program for both reading and math and science. Uh They take the students take placement when they first, um, access the program and that is about 10 to 15 minutes and it is seamless for them. Um They, they take placement and then it, the program immediately puts them into the sequence um where they are at where they're, you know, by the results that are indicated. So, um does that um I think that that would answer their questions and maths the same way? Ok. And they can access once they, once they do the assessment that Vicky just talked about, there's a report called the placement report where they can run that and they can see exactly where their student placed um in the sequence. So they get that immediate feedback of where did this student place in, in the Waterford sequence? That's correct. Excellent. Thanks. Shea. And just in case we do not get to all these questions, we're having a lot coming in. I love it. Um Can how do you find out who your support person is? Who do you contact? How do you find out who the person is to contact. If you do have questions. If they just, if you just do an email to partner success at Waterford dot org, we'll respond and let you know who that person is. Excellent. Ok. All right. So moving along, um, what? Ok, let me see. Um, so if you select to report a problem in the middle of doing an activity, what happens to the, to the student's activity? Do you still have to exit or does it do it automatically? That is a good question. That is a great question. And I don't, I don't know because I don't know if it would if usually that's when there's a problem and I imagine it would just go to the next. Can you hear me? OK. The internet, my internet is unstable. Just a second. It's still trying to buffer, let's see, still buffering my apologies. On a side note, I like how it showed how it, how you can find the placement reports. Yes. OK. I'm gonna stop sharing cause we're really at the end of the um the video of the webinar, but I will share the rest of that um with you guys. Um Let me go ahead and, and this, so back to this. So again, I will share this slide um presentation with you all. So do you all have any questions for me that I may be able to answer? If not? OK, we'll keep going. So again, this is where the um the slide presentation will be um with those individual pictures that they had of like the dashboard is gonna also be included in here as well for you. Ok? Um And then I just wanna thank you all for coming um to today's session and here is the little survey if you could fill that out. And if you want, I can put the link and two the chat as well and you can do it from there. But one of the, the, the things that I'm really excited about is um that they listen to the teachers and what they were voicing their concerns about the time. Um And also um one thing that I wanted to do, I want to remind you is that when the student takes the initial placement test, we wanna make sure that we convey uh convey to the caregivers to let that, that child do it independently because if they don't do it independently, um they're gonna go way off the charts and it's not gonna be adapted to their, really, their instructional uh learning. So we wanna make sure that they do that independently. Um And the playlist are gonna be awesome to use with your family and also making sure that you use the um family, family mentoring app, making sure that we are uh intentional about uh including the families and on what the student is learning. Um And I will have some more resources about that as well. Um So I'm gonna stop sharing, stop recording.\"), (696, 411, 2738, \"Welcome to the training on time and effort reporting for federally funded employees. Let's explore what time and effort reporting is. Federal regulation requires that any salary and benefits charged to a federal award must have documentation that meets the following criteria we must have in writing the employees time spent on tasks related to this federal grant. The documentation must reflect the actual time spent by the employee on activities of the federal programs being charged. It must also be accurate to the extent that it accounts for the correct time period. Code of federal regulations. Section 200.430 requires that any employee paid with federal funds document their time spent on a cost objective. A cost objective is a program like title one, title two A or I DEA in which expenditure data is required by the federal government. Because of this federal regulation, time and effort reporting must be in writing reflect the actual time spent on activities of the federal program in detail, the period of time covered for any school employee paid with federal funds. Now, let's take a look at some of the processes and procedures epic has put in place. Epic has procedures for collecting the required time and effort, documentation for providing training to employees paid with federal grants through this presentation for ensuring completion of accurate time and effort forms and reviewing the data and adjusting federal program budgets as needed. The documentation must be completed within set time perimeters. Documentation that employees work solely on activities related to the federal program being used for salary and benefits must be completed at least half of the employees work year or at the very least every six months. And the documentation must be completed after the work has been performed. So who does this apply to employees paid with federal funds at any school district are required to report time and effort.

Let's take a look at some of those potentially identified positions. Currently, we have these title one job positions here. We have identified title two positions. At this time. We have one job position under the title, one de liquid, also known as part D for the immigrant section. We have two job positions potentially identified and these are the potentially identified positions with I DEA when the state Department of Education requests this important information, what will it look like?

Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1559, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1573, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1579, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1705, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1706, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1868, 495, 3431, \"Have on Epic. So Lita started the recording. I'm just gonna reexplain for those that are not here today. And my name is Megan. I'm a part of bright thinkers, professional development team. We're gonna be walking through the student's application as far as what they can submit, what they're able to see on their side, all of the different features within Epic. And then we'll also look at a teacher's end and everything that you have a accessible through Epic, you all have a specific role. And so especially if you are a returning teacher and you notice something or you have a question about something, please don't hesitate to take your microphone off or throw something in the chat and just let us know specific Epic things. Um And then of course, if you have any questions that are regarding Epic specific leader will be throughout the chat as well. Um So Lena mentioned that y'all have a spreadsheet that was shared with us, which is questions for bright thinker. Um And it looks like yes, I'm still sharing my screen so you're able to see it. And these are just a few of the questions that came in. So we're actually gonna walk through the demo first because it's just basics of what it looks like and then we'll come back to the questions. So if you have any, please throw those in the chat or for Sophia or Lita and then you can also add to that spreadsheet and I should get updates. Um, but if not, if you don't see your question updated, just let me know at the end. All righty. So this is what it looks like for anyone in bright thinker when they click log in. Um As a teacher, you might see a couple different permission sets, you should as an epic teacher have the option as an administrator or a teacher. Mine says student because I'm enrolled as a student. Um So we're gonna start on that side when you're in the course. I'm actually gonna change my color really quick. I like it at blue. It's less distracting for me. Um But I know y'all's color is orange. So when we start as a student logging into the platform in the top left hand corner, it will highlight that the student is on their courses tab, they also have the option to click over to the to do list and this will show them anything past due at the beginning and then the next seven calendar days due from there. And I just wanted to remind as well as we're walking through here. Please do not hesitate to take off your microphone or talk in the chat and ask any questions as we're moving along in the platform. So these are all quick links for those students. They can click right into here and actually access that lesson. You'll notice that it's not showing the lesson for the student just because there's an activity due before this one and this one is just the getting started video. So we'll talk a little bit more into that in depth, but I'm gonna stay on the to do list for now. So these are all quick links. The student can work right from here. It will tell them the due date and most of the courses in epic are continuous courses, which means that the course will automatically pace out for the students giving them targeted due dates. So they're not hard set dates. These are just going to pace out depending when the student needs to end the course. By the last thing on the top, on these tabs that the student can click on is their activity stream. This is going to be a notification center for the students. So this is where they can come to see any feedback left by a teacher. If they have a new score updated, anything the student would need to be notified of as well. You can see click click links here. So any time you see a blue hyperlink as a student, you can click right in there and it'll either give you the feedback for the new score you earned. And then if I were to click on one of these titles that would bring me right into that lesson or quiz, I'm gonna click back over to my courses tab on the left hand side in order to navigate back to my courses. So this is exactly what it looks like, right? When they logged in, they'll always see the updated day and then the announcements to the right. So anytime a administrator at the top level, meaning lita or someone with an epic at a higher level has posted an announcement for everybody to see teachers and students. Or if you have as a teacher have posted an announcement, the student will be notified here and they'll be able to click and be able to see that announcement. It will notify them of who this came from. So my name in the site is Bright Thinker, but this would say the teacher's name who it was given to. So this is the course and then the date it was created and when it expires, you'll notice it automatically brought the student to the communication tab. This is something they can find in their hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. I'm gonna click back. We'll notice that it brought us right down to communication. I'm gonna click back into the home icon and how I got there was that announcements right from the home page. So speaking of that hamburger menu. We're actually gonna walk through there first. So I'm gonna click back up there in the top left hand corner and the first option down from the home icon is the grades for the student. So this is gonna be their overall grades. If they're enrolled in four courses, all four will populate here. They have that quick link to their course. They also have a heart icon. This allows the students to click and drag their understanding interest and effort levels to update their teacher on how they're feeling. And of course, there's four options within each bar and they can come in here and update this as much as they'd like. It will also list any teachers enrolled in the course and then they have two different progress bars when hovered over, it'll tell them the total number in each progress. This one has 43 on the right and this one has 37. The first one is just gradable activities. So anything included in the students final score, the other one is going to include any non gradable activities as well such as coloring pages, objectives, like getting started video, something that the student wouldn't require a grade for, but it's still an active activity they must mark as complete in order to finish the course. They can also view on the top left hand corner where it's highlighted as courses, any of their past courses. So I've been enrolled in quite a bit of past courses, but this is where I can come and see any scores. I previously earned my current status in that course. And then the progress and the time that I spent there, I click back over to the courses tab where the student would be and anytime they see this print icon, they have the ability to print this out. So it'll just give them that summary of the page that they're on. I'm gonna go back in the main menu and underneath here is the notes tab. So this is where students will hold such as a digital notebook. And any time they're in the lesson, they have an ability to take a permanent note where they can take notes on any of the content. They're learning to remind themselves of anything such as if they had a physical notebook in a in person class, just gives them the ability to come back here and have access to anything. They took notes while learning a lesson back in that main menu underneath the notes tab is the communication that's where we were brought earlier from the announcements notification. They can click through and see any announcements that has been posted by a teacher and or admin back in that main menu underneath the communication is gonna be the calendar again with those continuous courses, it will pace out for the student so they can come here and click anywhere they see the color coordinate dot with each course, anything due for that course, any blackout dates will also populate for the student and it will notify them that nothing is due on those days. So that's gonna be any holidays assessed by your administrators and already input into the main domain for you. But when the student is enrolled in multiple courses, they'll have different courses listed beneath with all of the different color dots for them. And these are also quick links. So if the student wanted to work right from their calendar, they could click right in here and begin working for the day. I'm gonna click back in the top left hand corner and down to student resources. This is the last option that a student has in their main menu. It's all of the frequently asked questions by students in the platform, especially if they're brand new to bright thinker all via video. But then at the very bottom, we also have a PDF option depending on the student's preference. Teachers and administrators also have this tab in their main menu. Should you need it? Um Just so you can help direct the students if they get a little lost in the platform. Lastly, underneath all of the main options, we then have a dark gray bar and all of the courses that the students enrolled in so that they can click right from here and begin working in their course. Should they want to from the main menu? I'm gonna use that home icon. And then that way we can look at what a course card is. So we call this rectangle of course card. It includes an image to coordinate with the course that the students enrolled in as well as the course title. And then these dates right here are gonna show unique to the student. The first and last day they can submit work in the course. Once they actually begin working, they'll have a current score populate here. And then the progress bar will actually also darken as they move along in the course. And then at the very bottom, we have a play button that will bring them right into the activities or the bar graph icon will bring them to their grades specific to this course. So we're gonna click on that play button and then the student will automatically see a few things here. So all of those same course details from the main page, but then to the right, they will be able to see their score right here once it populates, I haven't begun working. So I don't have one yet. The great icon again here. And then the eyeball feature allows the student to click and hide their score. So if they had a score previously right here, it'll just disappear as there's nothing there. It's not gonna change their grade in any way. It's actually just going to hide it from them if they're discouraged in any way or they just don't want to see their sport at this time. And then underneath they, they have a more in depth progress. So they're able to see by percentage and one hovered over the exact amount out of total that they have completed as far as activities in this course underneath, there is going to be the welcome page or the landing page. This is specific to each teacher. So once we switch over to the teacher, we'll show you how you can customize this. It's utilized in many different ways across the board. You can use this as a static announcement. You can include a Zoom link, any youtube videos, any text and images that you'd like to make unique to your course, just what you whatever you'd like the students to see as soon as they log into their course and then scrolling down, the student will then see the full entire course, all one through 10 units. If it's a core course under that activities page to the right. They have another quick snapshot of their to do list just for this course. And then they also have course links. These are all unique to this course as well. They can be included by the teacher as extra resources or anything you should want to show the student. When clicked on, it's just going to populate a new tab. We used our bright thinker site as an example. But again, you can use this for extra resources for math, reading anything you'd like, I'm gonna click back over to the activities and then the student can either start at the up next activity at the very top or they can open a unit folder and begin working at the first activity there. The getting started video is going to be in all of the courses for the student. It's just a quick walk through of the platform in case the student has never been a bright thinker before, they would click mark this activity as complete in the bottom left hand corner and then they would be able to move to the next activity by scrolling to the right hand side. Once here, this is actually going to show the next unit uh just a quick preview of what's coming up because we haven't yet begun working in this unit folder. So I'll click on that first activity. And in here, we've actually up included an upload example for fourth grade science. So this is a science journal activity requesting that the student create a cover page for their science journal and then a table of contents and all of the safety rules encompassing here. So as a student after I have finished my work, I have a couple different ways that I can upload in the platform. You can either click right into this text box and it will populate a ton of different options for the students. One being this picture icon that allows you to insert an image right from your device. So you can either click and drag an image right here. You can upload by URL or using this um camera icon. You can capture right from your device. If you have a webcam applicable, then the student also has the option to insert a video or audio. They can text right within the box, oops or they can use the plus button in the big blue circle in the bottom right hand corner allowing them to attach a file right from their device. So there's many different ways that the students can upload work. I'm gonna use your course list as an example and then I'll upload there. Once the student has uploaded, they can confirm before submitting their work that this is what they intended to upload. If they are not trying to submit this for their work, they clicked on the wrong activity, they can simply remove before they submit and select the correct image instead. But I like what I have. So I'm going to submit my work and then a few things will change for the student here. It's going to notify them. They have successfully submitted the assignment and the button now changes to resubmit my work into instead of submit. So is there a limit for the size of the file that they can upload? Um We, I would have to actually look into that. Lita let me take a note of that. We haven't run into any issues where students have tried to upload it too big of a file. Um I'm sure there is a limit but it's probably greater than anything a student would try to be submitting. That's a great question though. I'm gonna follow up on that just in case. All right. So that's how a student would submit work. And then if you scroll back just a little bit to the top, you can now see that the status has changed to completed slash submitted. And they'll see this little paper icon. Anytime a student sees this paper icon also in the top right hand corner in the platform, that means that there's either a portion of the activity or the entire activity requires something to be graded by the teacher. So they do not have the full grade yet. It's not an automatic submission by the platform. So they're waiting on a grade in here in order to move to the next activity, they can either use the toggle arrows in the top left hand corner or scroll to the bottom and use the next activity button in the bottom right hand corner from here. This is an example from first grade social studies. So it's gonna look a little bit different than those older grade levels for K through two, if we have any K through two teachers in here. Um This is just going to show you an overview how the difference the students have in that they'll learn just a little bit of the content and then answer those questions here instead of on the older grade levels, it's actually going to all encompass on one page and all of the content will be at the top and then they'll scroll to the bottom and review section in the bottom. So this was intended hopefully to hold that focus of the students as they're learning and cause less distractions instead of having it all on one page. And you will notice this is a good thing to take note of. Um these videos are not required to be watched. So if I was a student and I got to this last page and I decided I don't want to watch the video, I can click next um that they are able to watch that video if they would like none of the videos in Bright Finger are going to exceed three minutes. That is because they're intended to assist with learning but not teach the lessons themselves. So I'm gonna click next. Once the student hits this review page, they will see a check mark in the bottom right hand corner of each question, ensuring they have answered all of the questions, I'll click submit in the bottom right hand corner and then it'll give the student one last chance. So just make sure they don't wanna go back and check any questions before submitting, but I'm ok. So I'm gonna submit and then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, I automatically have earned a grade for this. That is because there was nothing open ended or essay, nothing to upload. So the teachers are not required to provide a grade before the student sees their answers or I'm sorry before they see their score. So if the student either can click jump to submission up here in the top left hand corner or they can scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll just bring them down here. There is a section called view grade details and this is where the student is able to see a quick snapshot of everything entitled in their course. So their score, the status is now completed, the targeted due date versus the date they submitted as well as the active amount of time they worked on that lesson before clicking submit. They can also then click over to the questions tab and the lower grade level students will have to click through in order to see their questions per number. Um But this is where they can come and see what they answered and the question score and you'll notice that this is actually exactly what an epic student sees um because I have changed all the settings to match. And so the student will see their answer and the score after the first submission, I'm gonna go back. They also have a submission history. It's just a quick snapshot for the student to be able to see if they submit again, then they'll see the second version here with the unique details of that second submission. So I'm gonna go back really quick since it's a first grade and resubmit my work so that you can see what happens after the second attempt. Um The students will always have this retake button available that to them for anything encompassing in the lessons category, which means lessons, activities, practice not included in the practice test, project skills and they have an unlimited number of attempts with epic. So they can click retake here in the bottom right hand corner and the activity will look as if this unit had never submitted. So they would go back through, provide a new answer or the same answer depending on their first round. And then oops, I missed a couple there. I think I skipped over number three. Yeah. All righty. And then once I click submit here, my new score will pop in the top right hand corner. So when I go down to my submission area and my view my grade details in the submission history, I can now see the 1st and 2nd version and the scores I earned the 1st and 2nd time. I'm gonna click back on the X air in the X in the top left hand corner. And then I'm gonna talk all to the next activity from here as the students are working in the platform. They also will have a couple different options to help assist as they're learning. So in the top right hand corner, you'll notice in the toolbar, we have a highlighter is the first option. Now, depending on which device you're on, it will allow you to either just drag over and that will highlight some devices require you to drag and click enter. Um So just be aware of that as students are working in the platform, the highlighter can be utilized in the content itself or in the review section. So this is a great example of how K through two is a little bit different than those older grade levels. This one came from an eighth grade course. So you'll notice how everything is on one page with the vocabulary at the top, the content itself and then the review section at the very bottom, they also have an eliminator to the right of the highlighter. This is going to give that visual process of elimination on multiple choice questions. So when hovering over, they'll see that little X and this will allow the student to visually cross out any answers, they are sure are wrong. The student accidentally clicks on one of the correct answers. No big deal at all. They can either just click that right back off or if they select that answer choice, it will take it off for them to the right of the answer eliminated. They will have the print feature. This is printing prior to submission. So they will be able to work on paper should they need to. Um but they would still be required to go back in and answer digitally on the platform to the right of the print feature. Then we have text to speech which will open up a full panel of options. So I'll go to the top so we can look at a couple of these options. You have the pointer finger which will allow the student to select where they would like the platform to begin reading. An assumption is a statement that is accepted. They also have the play button that will read from the very top of the um lesson itself and read up to 1000 words. They would then need to use the point your finger to continue. Should it exceed past those 1000 words past that we have the stop and pause button and then the translator. So this can do anything from a sentence to a word to a phrase to a paragraph. Um I'll just do one word here and then we can click the translator button up in the top right hand corner and this will translate the word for them. It looks like it's clicking on the wrong one. Let me try that again. So now let me check my settings really quick. Sorry about that. So mine's translating from English to Spanish. Let me try a fool. Freeze here. There we go. So it's gonna translate to the language specified in the settings which we'll get into in just a minute and it will read out for up to 18 of the most common languages. Some of them will only translate the text itself. I next to the translator is going to be a dictionary. So it will give a definition of a word or phrase highlighted. We then also have a picture icon to go along with all of the words in the platform. Next to that will be the screen mask, which is one of my personal favorites. This will allow the student to focus as they're reading through the platform. I used to do this with a bookmark on actual textbook. So it's nice to see this in a digital platform as well. And then last but not least we have the magnifier which coordinates with the pointer icon and will magnify the words as it reads to the students. Emotional appeals often use loaded language or last icon next to that is actually a highlighter. So very similar to the one that we have within the platform already. But this will actually give a couple different colors which is very useful in English or some of those higher level grade levels that need to annotate or use different colors. Um So you can just highlight over where you need to and click the color you'd like to use and then you'll notice the gear icon. This will allow you in the general settings to change the voice speed, the text highlighter color, the magnifier size as well as the speech mode. And then we have the translation button. This is where you can select which language it's translating from English to another language. And you'll notice this little um microphone or loud icon that just lets you know that it's actually going to speak that language to the student. Otherwise it will only translate the text to them. Then we also have screen tools. So if you'd like to change the reading light color, so this is just specifically for the reading mask, so I'll change it just so we can see what it looks like. And the student actually is able to open that screen mask and then change what it looks like. So they can decide actually that's not what I actually wanted there. Um And then they can do anything to their preference here and then should they not like anything, they can reset it back to the default. And we do have a PDF explaining everything that I just went through in detail. Should you need to share that with a student or go back and research your steps as you're walking through it on your own, any time you see the paper, airplane icon that's going to be communication form for the student. So as long as the teacher and the student both have an email within the platform, they will be able to send a message to this, the teacher keeping in mind this is going to go to every teacher enrolled in the platform. Um but they can ask a question right from here and it will send straight to the teacher's inbox of whatever email is specified in their profile last. But not least we have that notes icon, sticky note at the very top. Anytime you see it in the student tools that's gonna be a permanent note and it allows the student to take a note and it will save in that digital um notebook that we saw earlier in the notes tab of the main menu. So they can um either copy and paste into the platform of the notes or they can type right within here and then it'll time stamp it for them, tell them where it came from and then they can click right to their notes from here as well if they'd like to. But I'm gonna click through the questions at the bottom. Um Just so we can move on to the next activity and you can see what this looks like. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to take off your microphone or throw them in the chat. And Sophia will either answer them or let us know and we can talk through them as well. Can you delete um activities or lessons if you needed to? Absolutely. Sorry. Go ahead to modify for a student. Yes, absolutely. So we can go in a little bit in depth of it, specifically what Epic prefers as well. But once we get to the teacher's side, I'll show you the editor and you have freedom to hide activities. And so that will essentially excuse for all of the students that'll take it out of their preview. The only reason we recommend to not delete is just because especially if students had already begun working in the platform and it will delete all of the scores they previously earned. But that's a great question. All righty. So you all will notice um we had a few automatic grading options at the top of the activity. But then we also have some open end questions. We just wanted to put this in here so we can show you what it would look like for a student. So they will see that same icon indicating that something needs to be graded by a teacher and they will not be able to see a score until that is given by the teacher, but they can still see the review section. So everything they provided an answer for and then the text box at the very bottom um for the ones that had the and now last year lita I don't know if it's just on my side. I know you were asking a question but you were cutting out quite a bit. So I wasn't able to hear what it was. Yeah, there, there's some classes that have the guided notes, I can remember what they're called. Are they available this year or is that not till next year? Yes. So the accommodated courses are what you're referring to. I believe those are actually only going to have a reduced number of questions per ques quizzes practices and unit test. So they are available. Um Those are completely separate courses that would need to be added in. Um but they will be containing five questions across all quizzes and then 10 questions a across all practice and unit tests. Thank you, of course. All right. So at the sa the bottom, all those same options are gonna be here in order to view the grade details, see the targeted duty and when it was submitted and then they have that retake button available to them. I'm gonna click the next activity from here and this is actually going to be an example for once we get over to the teacher side. So I'm actually gonna skip this lesson and move on. I messed up. I forgot to allow myself to move on. So let me go ahead and submit this really quick and then I will be able to show you a quiz. All righty. So Epic does only allow two attempts per quiz for students. So it doesn't mean that the student can never take it past the two attempts. This is just prior to teacher intervention. So as a teacher, you'll always be able to go in and allow additional retries past those two attempts. But this is what the student will automatically receive. So when they click start, they will need to submit um require an answer per question and they will have to submit all at once. They don't have the ability to answer this question, leave and come back. Anytime a student leaves the assessment, they get kicked out via internet or issues or anything else that happens, the platform will. So let's say the student only answered this first question, the platform will submit for them, but it will never submit an answer for them. So it'll just all be marked blank. So they'll see the blank in the review section and then there'll be a um everything will be answered or marked as incorrect as far as the blank answers. So you'll be able to confirm, ok, there was probably an internet issue or they backed out of the quiz before they were done. The platform will never select an answer for the student. So I'll quickly go through and click so that you all can see the difference of what a student can see for the first admission versus the second. Um But as we'd asked earlier, there is something that we call an accommodated course offering this year. So it's brand new. Um And with those, all of the quizzes will only have five questions versus how you see here. This quiz has. I believe it's about 20 yeah, 20 questions So we're gonna click next. All of those are available. So I'm gonna click submit. So after I submit, there's no questions to display here. Um I got a 50% automatically and then I can view my grade details from here. I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. And then now everything that I have provided a submission for, I can see that green check mark indicating I've completed that activity, close that out and then this is just a full instructional unit so that you could see what it would look like outside of our examples. So this is third grade science unit two. It's gonna have about three lessons until it hits that first quiz. All of the activities, labs following pages will be sp sprinkled throughout the unit itself and then at the very bottom, they'll have a practice test and new unit test before they reach that next unit. Very similar. This is English one. Obviously, the grades are drastically different. Um But the flow of the course is about the same. So I'm gonna click back on my main menu in the top left hand corner. Now that I'm in a course, I have a different sub menu you'll notice. So I can click into my activities or grades from here because I'm already in this specific course. So the grades for each course, this is where a student can come see their overall score. There are different percentages for progress. And then if they scroll down to the bottom, they'll be able to see each line item submitted versus targeted due due date, the status and the score here. They also in the top left hand corner, have a dashboard, they can click on and then I'll just give a quick overview as well as the activity, which is a almost the far right, but about the middle and this will show the student exactly how long when they started working in each activity and then the total amount of time spent in this course, click back on that grades and then the main menu in the top left hand corner, they can either use these toggles, um icons in the top to navigate back to that regular menu or they can use that arrow to be able to see everything from here. So now that I took notes in that course, they populate here for me and I can actually click right back into the course I was working on. We use that main menu to go back to the student application. And then the last thing I'd like to show you on the student side is in the top right hand corner. The student's name will populate here again. Mine is just right thinker in the platform, they can click and get a couple of different options from here. Choose theme is gonna be the second one. This is where they can come and change their color theme. Now, of course, this can change at any time throughout the school year. If administrators at the top level of the domain decide they don't want students to do this, there's a couple of things they can turn on and off. Um But lady can correct me if I'm wrong. I believe the students currently have the ability to change the color and they also can choose their color scheme, meaning if they use the drop down option, they can change to a dark color scheme. So I'll do an obvious different color, like green and then the color will change everything such as their banners, their menu, anything that coordinates and then the dark color scheme have now changed everything that was once a light gray or a white color to a darker color. Um So this helps a lot with students that have headaches or issues with being on a computer for a long extended amount of time. Um But they definitely don't have to turn that on if they don't want to Megan walls just to show them how they share the calendar with their parents lito you're cutting out again for me how they view the calendar for their parents. Is that what you said? Well, I know that last year, the calendar Google calendar so their parents can see when things are due. Understood. Yes. So the students actually have the ability to go to their calendar. So I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner again down to the calendar icon and they will see these arrows in a circle and this allows them to sync and it will give them information on how to sync with their Google calendar. So it'll give all the due dates straight to their Google calendar. The only thing is they will not be able to click right from their Google calendar into the lesson. It doesn't um flow quite that well yet. Um But it will just show up the due dates in their Google calendar. So they're able to see it in both places. Um Teacher, I knew that this was really helpful. This would have been really helpful for my parents. I don't know what's due. I don't know when we was everybody able to hear lita on that one. No, I think you're sounds cutting out for everybody lita, but I was about to, I was able to piece it together. I think she was just intending that this is very useful for the students with Epic and the parents being able to see that calendar that the stu I guess, do the parents have access on their side to see their Google calendar maybe. And so it's a lot easier for them to be able to see that instead of having the students log in and showing them everywhere that everything's due. Yes. And you should be able to uh make that link of the calendar and the, that calendar in there. Um, as well. I lost little pieces, but I think I fully understand what you're saying. They're able to connect the calendars. So, yes, just that, those two arrows in a circle that allows them to see the options of how they'll sync those calendars. It's pretty easy. I've done it on my side. It gives you all the information right here and then they can connect those on their end. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you on the student application again where their name is in the top right hand corner, clicking down to see the first option is settings as a student. This will be all of the user details that were given to me once I was created as a user. But on the right hand side, I can put in any email or mobile number that I'd like with the coordinating carrier. So we see this a lot for parents and they can be notified of any of the following student notifications. So they would input their email and or mobile number, select their carrier and then come down here and they can choose either text or email depending on the notification. And then either daily or weekly of when the enrollment status changes, their grade drops below passing if they submitted an activity. Um someone replies to a discussion post. This is more in the high school level courses, not really in the younger grade. Levels. Um But if they're ever awarded a badge or they receive a score or feedback. So this is a great way to immediately connect with the parent's email and or number and just get notified of these few options here. And then the students also have the option to select from the avatar list. Should they want to pick an image for their profile and then they would just click save and refresh their browser to update anything that they had changed before we move on over to the teacher application? Did anybody have any questions of what we have covered or have not as far as the student application, you may have said this, but can they access um their activities from their calendar? Uh kind of like the to do list? Are they actually able to access from the calendar as well? Yes, absolutely. So if they select a day that actually has something to do with that color dot Anything they highlight over, they'll be able to click right in there and be able to work right from the calendar. And I will know um I don't have anything double due right now. But if they had multiple activities for one course, they would just have a little carrot button here and they would just click to expand and then they can click on each specific activity from there. OK. I have a, I have a question. Yes, ma'am. Um Is there like a standard or does it vary by grade level like this? Right. Thinker. Try to give students two activities a week per subject. Um, or does it just fluctuate depending on subject? And then, uh, the, the part where you showed where t where that you can sign up a parent's email address? J what's your, I'm sorry? Um, where you can set up the kid, the parents email address? Is that something that teachers can set up for them or would without having to log in through the parent portal? I mean, the student portal. Uh No, ma'am. So unfortunately, the notification settings will only be per user. So they would have to do that in their own settings per student. Um But they're very quick to access. So as soon as the student logs in, they can just click right from their name to the settings and then it's all right here for them. I was wondering if there was a way to lock that once you put in a email or a phone number. So the student couldn't go in and remove it. There's not. So it gives w freedom just for the ability. Should they put the wrong one in or they need to update it? It's there for them. Um But then back to your first question, Nadia, uh as far as pacing for the students, um can I ask which grade level you're teaching? Uh all, all grades? Sure. That's usually the answer for epic teachers. I just wanted to ask. Um Just because as of actually today, um the K through two courses have been given, let me go in here and find it so we can look at the same time. So if you're teaching K through two in the activities as a teacher, you'll see this course resource folder at the very top, you'll notice it's automatically hidden from the students. Should you want to show anything to the students you'll need to go in and allow students to see that. Um But within here, they have given an optional pacing guide. So this will help assist walking through the platform and knowing when things should be due. Um This is just kind of a basis should you need it? But if you're using a continuous course, it will pace out for the student. So with the continuous course, it's unique to each student. Of course, if one student starts in August and another student starts in September and they're still gonna take the entire course, they're gonna have a few more things due. Um But it really depends usually with the grades three through 12, it seems to be about one activity per day. But again, it's really dependent on the subject matter and what needs to be completed and things like that. Is it easy to modify those assignments for our fed kids? Like reduce questions or reduce answer choices? Yes, absolutely. So not on the teacher end and it might depend on what your uh um abilities within the administrator application are. So we'll look at those together once we switch over to the teacher side. Um but there's four accommodations that an administrator can set to each user. So with that, let me go over here. So when you have access to the users tab at the very bottom of the details, this is the four accommodations that can be set per user and this is across all of their courses. So never automatically assign zeros that's not going to be on anything by default. That's if a teacher goes into their course and decides they want to automatically assign zeros after past due activities, this student wouldn't be affected. You can also ignore any time limits on assessments. Should there be any also always allow speech stream that has been turned on across the board for epic? But should a teacher want to turn it off per course or per activity, then the student will still have access and then you can also limit the number of options on multiple choice questions. So if I put two here, then this student would only ever see two options across all multiple choice questions. But the another option that just became new available this year is those accommodated courses which will reduce those number of questions across all quizzes and practice tests and unit tests for students. Ok. This, that's fantastic. Um Can you just tell me one more time how you got here. And so this is just, you're just modifying this for Aaron Sullivan, right? So if I had 2/5 graders, one could have these accommodations and the other could go without them. Correct. Yes, ma'am. These are unique to each user. Um I didn't explain how I got here just because I wanted to make sure with lita that y'all had the ability to do this or is this something that you'll have to request by? Epic? Y'all do have specific teacher admin level permissions. Um But just because the school year ended, I wasn't ab actually able to see exactly what y'all have permissions on. Um And with, I'm not able to share my screen right now and show just because I would be showing student data if I were to go into y'all's actual site. So in your administrative settings, if you have the ability, you would just access. Um So right when you log in, you get the option of an admin or a teacher. If you accidentally click on teacher or you're already working in the teacher platform, you can use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner and that will allow you to switch over from admin to teacher if you're enrolled in as a student, that's how you'd switch to a student as well. So you'll want to be in the admin app and then you'll use that main menu and click down to the users tab and these are all fake students. I'm still in the training site. Um But you would click on the user id of your student and then scroll to the bottom and it's all right there for you. The only reason I say this is, I believe the last time that this was asked, y'all didn't have access to it so you can view it when it's here, but everything is grayed out. I don't know if that's been changed or not or if you all have access to it, but if you don't and it's all grayed out, you would just request that from Lida and, or another administrator. It's not lita um and they can come in here and add these accommodations per user for you. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I'm gonna switch back to the student app really quick. Did anyone else have any remaining questions before we switched over to the teacher's side? Megan? I wanted to mention, did you want to show the calendar how they can filter per day, week and month? Absolutely. That's a great one, Sophia. So I'm gonna go back to the calendar icon. Uh I'm sorry, calendar tab in the main menu. Um What Sophia was referring to is that if a student was on a specific day. So right now it's just gonna show the day that I'm clicking on. But if I come up here in the right hand corner where it labels the day, I can switch down to a week. So then if I'm just on this week, it'll still show me that Friday due date. If I click into this week, it'll show me everything due for this week or I can even show myself an entire month. That way the student doesn't have to be on the day and click into each day in order to see everything. Do. Thank you, Sophia. Of course, we have one more question from Andrea. Can we omit an activity for specific students and keep it for others? Yes, absolutely. So we'll just go ahead and switch over to the teacher side. A lot of the questions I think y'all are asking even prior to the training were in regards to the editor. So we'll go in there and look in that and then you all can see all of the different options of what you have for students. I'm gonna flick right back really quick. Is this where you were looking? Sophia was on the Yes and the chat. OK, perfect. I just wanted to make sure there was no questions in regards to the student application before I moved on student application looks good. All right. So again, in order to switch over to a different permission set from admin teacher student, you would use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner next to your name and then click over to switch. Um I forgot that I didn't enroll myself as a teacher So I'm actually going to log in as a teacher that I enrolled in the course. So one second, early credit. 223. Ok. All right. So this is very similar to what yours should look like. You should have admin or teacher. I'm gonna click into the teacher side and you'll notice everything looks very similar on the teacher's application that's intended so that if the students ever get lost or you need help with anything, nothing looks foreign to you. Everything is the same across the board, especially when you switch over to the administrative application as well. So I know that y'all had a lot of questions in the editor in order to get there. I'm gonna cover a couple of steps first. I just wanna make sure y'all didn't think I was forgetting about you. Um But right when you log in as a teacher, you'll still have that date here. And then um what's really great about this platform is that you'll have the needs grading right on your home page for you. So you'll have a notification of how many you have left to grade. You'll notice it's a three. Even if I click in here, I don't provide a grade for anything and I click right back out. That three is gonna remain there for me until I provide a grade for each of those three submissions. That way you don't ever have to get confused if you graded something or not it's always gonna remind you right here. You also have that announcements tab as a teacher that'll bring you to communication tab where you'll notice that there's any new announcements provided by an admin or you or another teacher created a new announcement. Um Only the teachers that are enrolled in the same courses of you that will is what you'll be notified of. So you won't be notified of other teachers that aren't in your courses. So I'm gonna click on that needs grading tab. And on the left hand side, you'll be able to see the three submissions here. And I wanted to show you the difference between these. So the first one is that first upload, I uploaded. If you remember where we showed the difference between the text or if you could use right from your device or use the upload and I chose the upload. So this is what you see as a teacher, you'll see the student's name, the course it came from, the activity is actually a hyperlink so that you'll be able to click right in there and see what the students saw as they were submitting. And then you'll also have the targeted versus submitted date scrolling down. You'll be able to see the student attachments and it keeps it all in one clean box for you. And then at the very bottom, anytime you see comments with a gray box, this is what the student also provided in the text box and then at the very bottom is a rubric provided for you. So you can actually typewrite within here grading per um section. And then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, it automatically calculates for me on the activity itself, you'll notice it's highlighted on content, clicking over to score and activity history is where I can see how many times the student submitted or I'm sorry, this is actually how many times the student visited the activity with a time stamp. But then the submission history is where you'll see that how many times they actually submitted the activity. And then all the way over to the right is class statistics. This is only applicable when more than one student has submitted and when it's in has a portion of automatic grading. So we'll look at one of those in a little bit. Um But all the way over to the right, this is where you can provide a score for the student. So I actually use the rubrics at the bottom and I'd like to keep my score. So I'm just gonna click submit score and then in the on the right hand side, you'll notice that that score populates for the student. So a seven out of eight was an 87.5%. Now, if I use this refresh in the top right hand corner, that'll refresh my list and anything that I've already graded will take out for me. So it can clear up some of that clutter. But let's say that it didn't have a rubric. So any, this is a great example of anything that's open ended, including with some of the automatic grading. So if I scroll throughout here, I can see what the student answered and what they got correct based on those automatic grading questions. But then anything that I need to grade will come to the top. So I can either use those points section where I can provide a grade and it will automatically calculate the rest of the score for me based on what the student answered or I can use this section in the top right hand corner. I can allow full credit which will give 100%. Keeping in mind it's not 100% just for these two questions. I need to grade. It's for the whole activity. So it's superseding anything they already provided as a grade. You can also allow no credit or clear out the score. You can revert to calculated, which is gonna give me that calculated score based on what they earned. You can also excuse which will take this out of the final scoring for the student's grade. They'll no longer be required to have this a part of their grade. It will excuse in the grade book and then they will no longer see it on their side. You can allow a retry again. This is only necessary should they exceed their amount that they had. So for lessons, quizzes, practices and unit test, there's a different amount that they have, but the lessons are unlimited. So you'll never need a quick allow retry for unlimited. But for the quizzes, they have two. So if they need that third additional retry, you can provide that here. You'll also then have the option to override complete. This will accept that failing score in the grade book. Should there be a reason that the student is not allowed to move forward with Epic? They should be able to move forward within the platform regardless. Um But should you ever run into that issue? You can always click override complete and then that will allow them to move on. And then at the very bottom in the right hand panel, you'll see that very familiar text box where you can insert an image video or audio as well as any emojis or text. And this will leave feedback to the t to the student and they'll see that in their notification center. So I'll click submit score and then again, I'll see that score provided and you'll also see that text box icon, the click down to my last submission. And so this is where you'll see an example. If the student just types a period or a dot exclamation point and clicks enter, you'll see that in the comments. So the comments is anything that the student has provided as an answer, you'll be able to click over to the score and activity history as well as the submission again. And then all the way over to the right underneath the feedback box, you also have the option to edit templates. So this is templates for feedback, if you click edit, that will allow you to create a template. So I'm gonna make this one for if the student did a great job in here and then you'll click done and now you have that template. So when I exit back out, instead of having to type into each students, the same feedback, I can just click right on that template and submit a score. So you'll notice you can't leave feedback unless you've also provided a score and that will populate once you provide a score at the top and then at the very bottom underneath templates, you also have returned attachments. So if you need to upload a file to attach with their feedback to the student, you can do that here as well as create a private note for yourself. So it'll remind you it is that it is hidden from the student. Should you need to remind yourself of anything here? And then you would just click submit score and again, that student would earn their score. Does anyone have any questions in regards to providing a grade for anything uploaded or um provided by the student? I had a really quick question. It was on the lesson just previous to this one that you um are showing, I think you um how to say it, but the questions weren't in order like the ones that you had to actually gray rather than multiple choice. Um You were able to pull those to the top. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So let me go back and then can you share that again? Yes. So it's gonna look a little bit different since I already submitted the score. But anytime you see something in the needs grading tab and the students have a combination where something is automatically graded by the platform, let's say eight out of the 10 questions. But then those two questions required, a teacher answer those two will always come back to the top. Ok? So they'll always ok. All right. Very good. So anytime you're in that needs grading tab, these two questions will be at the top for you. So you don't have to go search through the questions to find out which ones they'll be. Ok. Thank you. I was thinking that that was the setting of some type but ok. Very good. No, it makes it easy for you. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. So back in the teacher app, we were in that needs grading tab. I graded everything so you can use that main menu and you'll notice that it brings you down to the Needs grading. It's just another way to get there, but I'm gonna click on the home icon to get back to the main page next to the needs. Grading to the right is the announcements tab. This is where you can come as a teacher, you'll notice it brings you straight to the communication again. It's just that quick link from your home page. So you don't have to go to the main menu. Should you not want to? Um But in the top right hand corner, you'll have this speech bubble. So it has three lines and when hovered over it says new announcement, I just zoomed in. So I'm gonna go back out a little bit so it looks normal. Um But you'll click on that new announcement and this is where you can choose. So I'm only enrolled as a teacher in one course. But if you're enrolled in more than one, which I'm sure you are, you'll have all of your courses listed here and then you can check on the check boxes for which courses you'd like this announcement to be. So you can do it for one course, for five, for 10, for all three. It just depends on what you'd like and then you'll have a start and end date or you can display it indefinitely. So you forever and then you can, it does require a subject and then that same text box. So you can include any images that you have a youtube video, any text or emoji emojis here and then you can even edit the text if you'd like, make it bigger, change the color and then you would click post in the top right hand corner and then you'll notice because I created this announcement, I can edit this announcement or delete it because these announcements were not my own. I don't have the ability to edit or delete them, but you can also always click through here and edit any ones that you've created at any time or delete them. And then you'll also notice in the top right hand corner you have that paper icon. I heard a little noise. I wanted to make sure that wasn't anybody asking a question. I don't know if it's just me hearing the noises or not, but I don't usually work with Zoom. So I'm not sure if that's like someone raising their hand or asking a question. But let me know on my side. So I think you think Sophia, I was just hearing like little bells. I don't know. OK. But anyways, so there's that little paper airplane that allows you to send mail to your students. Or if you scroll, you can select a specific student enrolled in that course. Again, the student and yourself would need to have an email in your details page of your profile, not the notification that's separate. And then um you would need to re it requires a subject and then you can send a copy to yourself as well if you'd like. And this will send straight to the students email inbox. And then I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner to go back to my home icon again. So those were all the quick links right from your page. And then as a teacher in the top right hand corner, you have managed courses which is a little double sheet of paper. And the first drop down option is to order your courses. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course, but the more courses you have, they'll populate here and you can click and drag and reorder the courses so that you can select which courses populate at the top for you. So if you have a, let's say English courses that you need to provide more grades in or some other courses that you need to be more active in, you can bring them all to the top because I know y'all are enrolled in quite a bit of courses sometimes and then scrolling through here could be time consuming. So you can order those forces from that first icon in the top right hand corner. You can also view past courses from here at the very bottom. Should you ever need to? So you still have all the same icons and you can click right into that course and view anything you need. And then lastly, you also have the ability to view slash delete courses. Um So again, we highly highly recommend never deleting anything in brighter because you never know if that's gonna delete all the scores, the grade book, anything that you need in there. Um But this is where you can just hide the course from your title. So let's say that you're still enrolled for another month, but that was little excessive for you. You didn't need it for another month and you just don't no longer want it on your page. You can just hide that from yourself. And then when you go to your home page, it's just no longer showing for you. So let's say you had 10 horses and you wanna hide five of them from yourself so that they're no longer cluttering your page. You can do that and you can always come back and unhide it from yourself as well. All the way over to the right where your name is as a teacher, you can click down and you'll have the same settings. So you also have a notification preferences very similar to the student email and or mobile number, but then you would scroll to your teacher notifications and you have the options to be notified of when a student submits something. So this is actually gonna be when a student submits anything. So it's not just any open ended or essay that require you to grade. We have put that as feedback to buzz, which is our learning management system we use um that holds the bright thinker content, but we've requested that, that be separated. So that's an option. But as of right now, this is just any time a student submits something. So now that um if a student submits an automatically graded assignment, you'll still be notified of that. Just keeping that in mind and then anytime a student's grade drops be passing or if a student's enrollment status changes. So with those three options, we highly recommend to either use email or if you specifically have T Mobile, then it's ok. But some of the other carriers, we've gotten feedback like cricket or I can't think of the other one. So via chime in if you can, but those actually notify you with separate text messages. So every single time that it's submitted, you'll get a new number, texting you. So your inbox will be full and it's just not the best sometimes. But with T Mobile, we've heard feedback and with emails, it'll all come as one text message. So uh for lack of better terms, it's one number that it comes from. So you get separate texts within one number, but you won't be bombarded with 500 different threads of texts. Um Outside of that, you also have the option to upload an image. So the students don't have this option in their avatar, you can click the plus button and choose a picture right from your profile, right from your device. So you can choose a personal picture of yourself or a picture of your dog, anything you wanna include, um, or you can choose an avatar just as the students do and then anytime you change anything in your settings, you'll wanna click save and refresh to allow those to take place. And then that'll bring you back to your main page in your main window. As a teacher in the top left hand corner, you'll have that needs grading tab, same exact from the one on the main page. You'll also have notes as a teacher very similar to the students. If you take notes in the lessons or anytime you see that notes icon, you can come back here for reference. Underneath. There is a communication that is where we were brought earlier with the announcements. It's the same page and then the calendar as a teacher also shows you anything that's due. Please keep in mind this will not be identical to the student unless your enrollment dates are identical in a continuous course. Meaning if a student isn't enrolled until August, but you have early access in July, your due dates will not line up with the students. It's gonna take your starting in date and line everything out then and again, that's only for a continuous course. So if you have a range course and you are set to set the due dates, then those will be identical to the students. Um But outside of that, everything is very similar, they are quick links, you can go to as a teacher and then you can switch between day, week and month back underneath the main page. You have a new tab that the students do not, which is the people tab. So this is going to show everyone enrolled in every single course that you have. So this will give a quick snapshot of everyone that you have access to as a student in the top right hand corner. The gear icon is where I recommend you go first. This will allow you to select what you view in the people tab. I like to turn everything on and then I click save and it's gonna give you quite a bit of options. So if you don't need everything in here, that's totally fine. You can click it off. Um But I just wanna show you all of the options that you have. So the first is the co I'm sorry. Could you, could you show me again how you got to that last screen? Yes. So I'll go back a couple of steps just in case anybody else is a little bit confused on how I got here in the main menu. In the top left hand corner, I navigated down to the people tab and then in the people tab all the way over to the right. The gear icon is how I selected what I wanted on in this page and then you click save and everything has been turned on here. So the first icon is the accommodations. Um So those ones we just spoke on earlier as far as um speech stream being turned on all the time limiting the number of questions per multiple choice um across the board for the students, all four of those are going to show the teacher right here. So I don't have any um accommodations as far as this user. So I'm actually gonna go in and turn an accommodation on really quick so we can see what that looks like. I'll turn them all on. Ok. So now that I have an accommodation set for this user as a teacher, I can click in the people tab and be able to see what those accommodations are. So accommodations for this student and then they have everything turned on and then they'll just give you notifications of those. Um And then Sophia did update me via lita since her microphone is not working, all epic courses are continuous. So I will continue the training with just speaking on continuous courses to not confuse you. So sorry about that before, but everything will be automatically paced out for the students. So based on their enrollment start and end date, everything will pay for them. So that is true. If you're given early access as a teacher and you don't have the exact enrollment dates as a student, it'll be a little bit different in the calendar just keeping that in mind. Um But next to the accommodations you can see the overall score the student has and let's say this right. Thinker student was enrolled in four different courses. They will actually populate four different times and the course that you're looking at will be listed right underneath their name. So for this specific course, this is their score and amount of time they spent there, I can see their understanding, interest and effort level. If they completed their heart, heart icon and the date it was changed and then scrolling over, I can see the progress and mastery. The online indicator is my personal favorite. This will show me any time a student is logged in at the exact same time as me. And then you also have the pace and performance indicated by a green yellow or red dot So this student's pace is on schedule, but their performance is currently failing in the courses. And then you can see any badges and anything that any badges they earned, anything today that they submitted any failed assignments or late as well and then the end date for this student. So this is the quickest way to come and see. The last date that the student has to submit is December 28th 2022 for this course and then back up in the left hand corner to the main menu underneath the people. Tab is our customer support link. So this is where you can come and click. This will bring you right to a new tab and this is where you can either provide feedback, report, an issue or a bug or submit a help ticket. Um So we actually also have access to your Epic quick start guide, which I'm gonna open really quickly, which has been beautifully updated by LITA. Um But everything in here is specific to Epic and bright thinker. So any questions that you may have, it can easily be found in here and you can click control, find and just type in anything that you need to find and it will update here for you. I'm not saying that we are not here to help you with any additional questions. It's just a quick guide to help you. Should you need it. And I'm sure Leah can provide that link if anybody doesn't have it. And then back in the main menu underneath the customer support tab, we're actually gonna skip over clipboard for today. It's a little bit more advanced. Um but I'm gonna click on the more reports option. So this will allow you to pull a PDF version of any of these reports. So we have a student daily activity of progress and a grade details. So I'll show you an example of what that looks like the student daily Activity report. It's gonna show you time stamps of everywhere. The student was logged into the platform and how long and then the grade details report will give you a quick overview of the course that the students in. So a course grade their progress and then all of the grades that they have earned thus far. And again, those can be found in your more reports. Tab lastly, you have access to that student resources identical to the students on their side. Should you need it? And then your any courses you're enrolled in will populate in the bottom left hand corner as well with a color co ordination. I'm gonna click back on the home icon and now we're gonna focus on the course card. So yours similar to the student, but you have extra access. So you'll still have a course card with the image coordinating to each course, the course title as well. And then you have the activities icon, your grade book, the reports for each course, which is different from the more reports tab. You also have the people tab from here, which is a more in depth look of the people tab. So the one from your main menu is gonna encompass all of the students. This one is just for this course and then you also have the editor. So I'm gonna click on the play button first is very similar to the student. This is where you come and you can use the pencil icon to edit the landing page. So you can put anything you want here, you can change this daily, weekly, monthly, leave it the entire year, whatever is best for you and then scrolling down, you'll be able to access the activities just as a student does. So for example, if you wanted to come in here and view this eighth grade language, arts activity, you can see it exactly as the students see it. But even further in the top right hand corner, you can see that you're viewing ads yourself if you click here and the first drop down is view ads. This allows you to select a specific student. So I know that my student has already completed it. I'm gonna select, ok. Now I can see the score, they see I can go down to their submission. I'm able to see exactly what they have submitted. I can see that they have a retake available to them and I can even view their grade details as well. So this is the quickest way you'll be able to confirm a few different things without having to log in with credentials of a student or ask them on their end. You'll be able to just see right from here. I'm gonna use the back arrow in the top left hand corner to be brought back to the main page. And then this is just where you'll come. If you wanna do anything in the course such as the students, I'm gonna use the main menu in the top left hand corner. And now that I have selected this specific course, you'll notice my menu changed again. So this is the sub menu just for this course, the same icons we saw on the course card on the main page. So I'm gonna click down to the grade book. There's a couple cool features in here in the top right hand corner, you have a gear similar to how you have in the people tab. This is where you can select what you'd like to see in your grade book so you can choose user name. The last time the students logged in minutes spent in the course accommodations, um any progress or enrollment status and then any footers that you want. So if there's missing or low scores, anything like that and then at the very bottom, you'll have a box titled tools. This will allow you to export to a different course. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course. It's not gonna show me any other courses, but you'll have a list of other courses with check boxes and you can export the same settings you just chose here to all of your other courses. So you don't have to click into the grade book settings for each of your courses and change all of the settings. It'll just across the board, change for you. And then anytime you make changes, you wanna click save here and everything will apply. So I see that same accommodations flag I saw in the people tab, you can click there and view what those accommodations that student has their score per activity. And then in the top right hand corner next to the gear icon, once to the right is your lightning bolt which enables quick editing. This allows you to click any cell in the grade book, whether it has already earned a score been provided by you or is blank and you can enter in a score right from here. So you type in the score and click enter, you also can enter in an X and that will automatically excuse the assignment. So when someone asked earlier, if you can excuse an assignment for one student, but not all of the everyone in the course, this will be the quickest way, especially if you only have a couple assignments that you're trying to excuse for the student. This will allow you to go in and excuse and then you'll wanna make sure to turn that lightning bolt off so that you can go back in and not be affecting the score. Should you not want to anymore? Next to the lightning bolt is a tool. Um A wrench icon when clicked on this will allow you to export your scores. Should you need them in a CS V file? So it's just an Excel spreadsheet. I'll go ahead and export it so we can see what it looks like. Should you need the scores externally? It'll just show you that quickly for you outside of here. I'm gonna click and back into the grade book. So this is where you can do a couple different things. If you click into any scores already earned, this will show you the same tab as the needs grading tab we saw earlier. So you can come and adjust grades as you had before. You can edit your templates and then you can view with the submission history and the score activity from here if it is something that was automatically graded, so I'll go into the quiz, you'll be able to see all the answers. So you had not provided a score for this. This is automatically graded. Um but you do have the ability to change the score. So should, for whatever reason you decide that this student should earn court points for the justice question. You can go in and adjust the points for that question. It'll automatically update the score and you will need to click submit if you wanna save that score and then you'll notice the updates already for you. Another really cool thing in the grade book is if you click on the actual title of each of the activities on the click on quiz two, this will bring me into the stats. So if I had multiple students, it would list them all here the last time they logged in their status and score. But if I click over to analytics on the top, right, then I can scroll and see how the students answered. So again, I only have one student in here. But this will give me class statistics, 100% of this class answered the question wrong. This is the correct answer and so on, you can see 100% answered correctly. So if I decide that the students were not fairly questioned on this quiz, and I want to remove the question from score, I can do that here. And that will automatically give scoring back to each of the students that got the answer incorrect. So then if I use the back arrow, we can see the student did get that question incorrect. So now their score went up even higher automatically without me having to do anything else. Does anyone have any questions in regards to the grade book, how to change anything, anything like that? Perfect. So I'm gonna click back on the main menu in the top left hand corner underneath the grade book is the reports tab. These are all per course and will pull as a CS V file. So none of these are gonna be the PDF that would be in the more reports on the main menu. Um but this will allow you to pull a, a report on the grade book or the student in regards to performance on all of their courses or just in specific courses. Um Should you need any reports externally and then back in the menu menu underneath the reports is again another people tab, but this one is unique to this course. So it's only going to show you the students enrolled in this course and you'll notice I don't have all the options again just because it's a completely different people tab. I would need to go into that gear icon in the top right hand corner and select what I'd like to see on this people tab. But in the main menu, the last option when in a course is the editor. So this is how you're gonna come and see a lot of different things for bright thinker in the bottom left hand corner, you'll see a carrot right here to expand the left panel right now. I'm just in a course for actually, I have a meeting. But let me go back out, I'm just in a demo. So I actually don't have any standards aligned, but I'm gonna go into an Oklahoma course. So you can see what that would look like. So let's just pull up fourth grade El A. So when you're in the editor, let's say this is your actual course. You'll use that expansion arrow and then all of the standards that align with fourth grade El A for Oklahoma will be right here. But then when you open each unit, you'll be able to see what is covered for activity. So thats gonna be how you view standards within the course itself again in the editor and then you just expand on the left hand side to view, but I'm gonna go back really quick to the Doma demo. And then within each course, when you want to view something in the activity list, you'll need to open that unit folder with the carrot button and then that's how you'll see those activities in order to view correct questions. There's two ways you can do that in writing, thinker. So with any activities that have automatic grading like this, 4th, 8th grade, El A, I'm gonna use that pencil icon all the way to the right. And that will allow me to access all of the details and I'll click over to the questions tab and these are all the correct answers. Another way to view the correct answers on the exit out of here is it will be listed right beneath it. So if it's an upload, that isn't unique to a student answer, it's not gonna have 100 different possibilities of an answer. For example, math, it'll just have one or two. depending on the content, you will have an answer key listed right below. You can see this in the activities page as well actually. Um But when you're in the editor, you will go all the way over to the right using that triple dots and click preview. And this will allow you to preview the correct answer sheet for that activity. So this is an example of an activity, the student would upload work. There's only one possible right answer. So you'll have that answer key. When grading, I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. So again, the two different ways is either if it's already automatically graded and it has the answers in the platform, you use that pencil icon to go to the questions tab or if it has the answer key right beneath it, you'll use the triple dots all the way over to the right and preview underneath there. So all the way over to the right, you have three different icons. The first is an eyeball. So this will automatically excuse that assignment for everyone enrolled in the course. So let's say you wanted to hide the entire unit, the unit is closed here. So then I could just click the eyeball. And when I spanned the unit, everything within the unit is going to be hidden from the students. If you uncheck that eyeball, everything is then revealed again. So the benefit of the eyeball is if half the students have worked in there and half have not, if you hide the activity, everything will be taken out of the grade book, the students will no longer be able to see it, they'll not be required to work. But if you reveal it at any point, then all of those scores are able to come back. So that's why we recommend using the eyeball instead of deleting because it's kind of a safety net for you. But then you can also hide just the lessons within here or you can hide just one quiz. Um But keeping in mind any of the eyeballs here will hide from everyone in the enrolled in the course. So all students then next to the eyeball icon is that pencil editor outside of the questions tab, this is where you can see the settings. So all the settings across the board have been set for Epic. Um These are not Epic settings, these are just my demo course settings. Um But the number of temps is already there for you. Everything across the board has been submits this activity. I know last year there were some issues. If you're a returning teacher that students weren't able to move forward, it was making you grade things, we've changed that across the board. So students should be able to submit and move forward regardless of the score they received regardless if there's anything to grade or not. Um And then the passing score has been set to 60 as well. So everything can be found in that pencil icon to the right of the eyeball and then all the way over to the right of there is the triple dots. This will allow you to preview the activity. You can also move up or down or to a different unit. Should you need to, you can duplicate the activity as well or you can copy it to your library. So when you click copy to my library on the right hand side. If this isn't already expanded, you'll have another Carrot here to expand and the icon all the way over to the right is my library and you'll notice that copied in right here. The benefit is that we'll stay with you as a user. So if you would want to use this in a different course, at any point in time, you'll always have that activity with you, especially if you customize it from scratch or you need a completely different activity, you can copy it to your library and then that allows you to click and drag anywhere you'd like to have it. Um I have a quick question. Um And I'm sure you, you probably already said this. So I apologize but um when you click the pencil and then you can edit those settings and you can edit like how many attempts and stuff. What um this is all standard. So like is our default gonna be that they'll have two attempts. Um So let me go in. It is going to be the default for you, but the ones that we were looking at were not already epic settings. These are though. So let me go in here. So actually for lessons, the students have unlimited attempts for epic. But yes, this is where you would go to see the default settings that were already set um And or change them. Should you need to? Ok. So we're giving students unlimited attempts on assignments on lessons category. Yes, on the lessons. Ok, thanks. Yep. And then um further in there with that epic quick start guide again, if you do not have access to it, I'm sure lita already put the link in the chat. Um But at the very bottom is where all the settings are. So if you wanted to come and, and I think these are already updated. Yes. So they said changing to 60% for the school year. Um But everything in here is the settings that have already been applied by default to your courses. So that's at the very bottom of the quick start guide. Ok. And where is the quick start guide? One more time? I'm gonna a bookmark it. That's OK. I actually don't have the link to provide but lita if you don't mind putting that in the chat, I think she already did. Yeah. So if you see the chat of the zoom that we're in. Lita provided it in there, I also included it on the epic one bright thinker channel. Perfect. Thank you Lida. OK. So let me exit back out of there. Um So that is how you can move things around from the far, right, the triple dots, you're able to move things around copper library. Again, we highly recommend delete, not deleting, not to know. Um But you can also click and drag. So let me open a full instructional unit so we can see um keeping in mind if I click and drag this qui quiz two to be before quiz one, everything is meant to be in sequential order for bright thinker. So everything in quiz two encompasses less than 45 and six or whatever was prior to it. So if I go down here less quiz three is in company encompassing 78 and nine. So if I move it before those, the students are gonna be quizzed on things they might not have ever seen. So just keep that in mind when you're moving things around and editing and adding in your own things. Um and then at the very bottom left hand corner, the add activity. So it's kind of hard to see. Um but it's the very last option on your syllabus, you can click add activity and then anything in the first 3rd and 4th quadrants. So the L shape at the bottom will be blank. So you can add in an assessment and activity file attachment, youtube video and it will not contain anything in regards to bright thinker. So that's how you can um customize your own activities, add in flash cards, a journal, anything you like here. But then in the top right hand corner where it says library, you will be able to access your master courses. So you'll click open on that file. It'll take a minute because it's actually opening every single course that bright thinker offers. So let's say you are teaching fourth grade science and you want to supplement some third grade science and you can open this uh course, you can open any of the units that you wanna view and you can even preview the lesson before adding it in. So you'll scroll through, make sure this is the lesson you wanna add in. Then you'll click add to cart. It's not gonna cost any money. It's just the titling system they used. You'll have to click the cart button in the top right hand corner and then you'll always wanna click link. The difference is that link will link it back to the master so that any updates we make, it'll still come through to yours. All of the images will come through and all of the video as well as well. Um And the way that you can ensure that it was actually linked in is you'll see that little link icon. So actually all of these have it because I linked them in versus if it was already in your course, it does not have that little link icon thing. Um But then that will come in and you can click and drag that wherever you should need it. And then let's say you already have a lesson to. You'll wanna click on the pencil icon and you can change the title and then it'll look as if it was always there for the student. The only thing indication that it has come from a different grade level is state specific courses. Oklahoma. Third grade history, it'll actually show that it says third grade history in the lesson itself. That's something that can't be changed. Um And then all of the K through two courses have little videos throughout and they actually have a title with the grade level in there. But other than that, the title of the actual lesson um within the lesson itself for third through fifth grade outside of Oklahoma, it's not going to tell them that this came from a lower grade level or a higher grade level, whatever you're going from, I'm gonna click back out of here. So that is pretty much everything within the editor syllabus section. But then you'll notice in the top there's a couple different tabs. So I'm gonna click over to weights. This is where you can view the category weights. So again, I'm gonna use actually a different course, for example, because mine's not a great one. Um But you'll be able to see how the course is waited. So you have lessons, quizzes, practice as a unit test and then you'll even be able to open those and see what is encompassing between those. So you can ensure that you know that that lesson is 25% of their overall grade versus this unit test is 50. Um These are not epic settings. These are my demo ones. Again, let me go and see what epics are. Oh, actually they are. Yep. Epic uses the same one. So it's 2525 0 50 for lessons, quizzes, practices and human tests. And then next to that, we have the activity list. So this is within the editor. Let me close. I'm actually gonna get out of here. So I don't actually change anything in our master. Um But in the activity list, this is where you can come and filter so you can type in quiz. Um You can type in lesson anything you want to change all at one time. Um And just keeping in mind that when you type in lesson, that's also gonna populate the answer key and things like that. So just be aware of what's populating on that list, but I'll do a quiz for an easy example and then you can check box the box at the very top right hand corner and that will check everything on for you. And then in the top right where that pencil icon is to bulk edit, that will allow you to do a couple different things in bulk. So if it's grayed out, that's not allowing you to do that in bulk, just because a specific there might be one or that whole activity type is not allowing you to do it in bulk for whatever reason. But if that check box lets you check it on, then this is how you can quickly do a couple different things in the platform. So who the activity is visible to that is the eyeball icon. So this is hiding, if you change to teachers only or teachers and observers, it will hide from all of the students. So it's automatically excusing for all of the students at one time, everything that you checked on, you can also change the location. So if you wanna put all of these quizzes to one folder and move everything at one time, you can do that. You can also change the passing score quickly from here. Again, it's set to 60 for epic. But if you want to, if there's a couple quizzes that were off and you wanna make sure they're all 60 you can do that here. Um assessment password. If you want to require the students to enter a password before they take the assessment. Again, this is going to encompass everything that you check on for. So it would be required to be across the board. And then you can also change the number of attempts for quiz. It's currently two, but you can put in custom and change the amount here as well. You'd wanna click the check box confirming that you understand it's permanent update and then that will automatically update all of the items that you checked on there for you. Um Also from this tab, you can preview, so using that triple dots, you'll, you're able to preview this assessment, should you want to before you edit it and then all the way over to the right is group settings. So this was a question that someone had in regards to how to hide maybe an entire unit from one student instead of everybody at the same time. So the lightning bolt in the grade book that we spoke on earlier is the quickest way to excuse one or a few activities from one student or a couple students. Um depending on what you're doing. But if you need to hide an entire unit or a couple units, that might be a little conti time consuming in the grade book. So you can create groupings um within the group settings, you would need to click the wrench icon in the top right hand corner and down to manage groupings and this will allow you to add a group. So for example, I'm just going to put start dates here. So I'm gonna have a few students that are starting at different dates and I might wanna hide some things from them. So the group creation method, I'm gonna do a fixed number of groups because I want there to specifically be two groups. But you can also do a target number of students per group. And then you can select how many students are in groups and that'll based off of how many groups there are. Um And then the group assignment I always select none because I want to choose which students go into which groups. But you can depending on which types of groups you're creating, select random round robin alphabetical the same or different by performance and, or um by the different quarters. Um top or bottom, things like that. So I'm gonna click generate with none. And so then it's automatically gonna give me an, a title right here in the top right hand corner where you have the edit groups with the pencil, you can change this title that it automatically gave you. So I'm gonna title this August, my students that are starting in August and then I'm actually gonna have some more students starting later. So I'll use this little people with the plus button to add a group and then again, I can edit that name and let's say these students start in September. Perfect. So I'm gonna put my student in one group. If for whatever reason, the type of groups that you're determining, you can check off this box and allow your student to be encompassed in both groups. Um But I just want one. So then I'll click save and you'll assign all your students to whichever group you need. And now I have my start date groups. So I'm gonna click the back arrow and then you'll notice you're choosing your grouping. So if you have multiple groups, you can select which one you're affecting right now and then where you're at and then view by either the property, the activity itself, which is the group or the groups will align on the right hand side. So I like to be in property. It's the least confusing for me personally. And then you can either you can change the visibility. So this is only for my students starting in August and this is only for my students starting in September and which groups I put them in. So now I can go in and I'm actually only in the core content, but I'll go back up to the full course. I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in September or I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in August. That way you can hide multiple units, multiple activities from specific groups of students and you don't have to do it from your main page, hiding it from everyone. And I know we went through that rather quickly. We do have a PDF walking through every step and what everything means. And of course, if you have any questions and there's interest in the need of an advanced workshop, we can always do that as well. But I'm gonna go back to my questions tab that you all had um on questions that you asked. And then Sophia, if there's anything in the chat that's not in here, please let me know. Um I, I have a quick question on the groups. Is that something that you said we'll talk more about in the advanced class? Yes. OK. And we have a PDF as well. That kind of gives like a description in depth of every option that you can select. And also this year we're gonna talk about um during office hours uh at the beginning of the year, Megan and Sophia have agreed to join us the first week um on one of the days. So if you have questions or as you guys are getting into it with students and have questions, you can join us as well. But then also um throughout the year, we're going to have specific skills that kind of go along with that time of year uh that we will highlight and um do a video tutorials on as well during office hours. Yes. And the benefit of office hours that we've done in the past is it gives us the opportunity that we only um have one teacher in the, we have the ability to only have one teacher in the zoom meeting at one time and we don't record those. So that way if you have a specific question and you need to share your screen with student data, something's going on with your specific student, we can walk through that and look at your screen together um outside of a group setting where we can't share student data. OK. So I'll just start from the top. One of the questions that was asked is how can we edit calendar pacing for the to do list but not affect the course and date to prevent the course from expiring. Um So the only way to edit the to do list is if you're in a range course mode and that allows you to edit all end dates. But the difference with that is it doesn't give um pacing for the students. And so all of the courses for Epic right now are currently in continuous. So you would not be able to edit those to do estate um outside of changing their enrollment and dates, which is I know was a part of the question said not to. So, but if you do change the enrollment starter and date, that will obviously change the pacing for the student, um I might need a little bit clarification on the next question, but I will go off what I think you're asking and then if you're in the zoom call, let go ahead and let me know if I'm incorrect. But the next question is, can parents slash students change from their app if they want to work ahead? So Epic actually doesn't um for lack of better terms, gate students. So you can work as far ahead as you want and they actually don't even have to work in sequential order. So the students are able to work wherever whenever, as far ahead as they want. That was from a question who from someone who said she wasn't able to make it. Ok. Hopefully you are watching the video back and then if you have another question um or I didn't answer that correctly, please just let Lita or myself know and we can further discuss that. And then the next question was where can I hide things from student view? We covered that in the course editor with the eyeball icon. Even further, you can also hide things from students using the lightning bolt in the grade book with the X and enter and that will excuse it from a specific student. Um How can I change the number of attempts on quizzes, practices or exams? Um That's what we covered earlier, either by the pencil icon in the settings or in that activity list of the editor where you can do multiple things at one time and then same thing with the past threshold, it's gonna be in those settings or in the bulk editing feature. Will the K through two have social studies and science? Um We do provide social studies and science on the bright thinker side from K through two. It might just be that lita and the team are working on them. So you might not see them in the demo just yet, but we do offer them. Um And then can you show us how students take notes? We did cover that in the student side. But if you are still confused on that or have a question, please let me know is there a specific writing course for fourth through eighth to match PS grade books? Lita you might need to help me with that one. I'm not sure what a PS grade book is. The PS is Power School. Um, got it. Yeah, we're doing the, the talking back and forth between, uh, bright thinker and power school to automatically load the grades. So they have to have the same settings and the same forces. Got it. Ok. But I think four through eight we just have English. Correct. Yes. Mhm. As far as what brand thinker offers? Yes. And then is there a general supply list? And that was already answered, they will be shared on the bright thinker channel of epic one. I did wanna mention some of the supply lists as far as we know what you have access to might not be updated just because they have updated all of those courses as of this year. Um So if you're a teacher looking for a supply list, let me go back into the platform at the top of I closed it out. Let me go back in really quick. At the top of any of your courses, you have the ability to view the supply list, the teacher guides, anything like that. So for a K through two course, when you're in the activities, you'll have course resources as a teacher, this one has a pacing guide and then underneath each unit will have the teacher guide and a unit workbook for the students to be able to print everything they need. Should they need it. But in that teacher guide for K through two is where you can find the supply list in here. Um If they have any that's needed and then they also give you supplemental material. Should you wanna add anything outside of what is already covered? And then for those older grade levels, I'll pull up an example. We'll go to fre map. I don't think that fifth grade math will have a supply list, but anything that is needed at the top will be in a PDF for you. Um So this is gonna let you know the course manipulatives needed um throughout the course. And then I know for like some of those higher level courses like biology, they also have course resources at the top. So um teacher guidelines with, with or without the lab manual and then if there's any principles, those will also be within the unit as well. So right within the course, it'll hold that supply list or anything that the students need. Um So we recommend definitely going into the course itself once you have access to them to ensure that's everything that's updated for your specific courses. Um But we are working to update those supply list that you have access to Rita. Ok. And I have access to those courses, so I should be able to pull those. Correct. Absolutely. Mhm. Ok. Um And then one other thing too is last year Lindsay went in and found the, um, the novels that are required for each of the, the uh classes and she put together a tablet that has access to those novels as well. How wonderful. That is awesome. Um, the, yes, the required reading list. I think you have access to this one later, but this will list out everything that's externally required as far as a novel in each grade level and where it's used in each unit as well. Um Let me see where we left off. Is there an upload limit? So I took note of that. I don't believe that there is especially not what the students would be uploading. Um But again, I'll check with Buzz RL MS just to make sure um lita before our advanced workshop, if you have time, let's schedule a time so that we can discuss the admin level permissions that teachers have. Um Just because no one is currently enrolled in courses. So I wasn't able to see that and I didn't want to misanswer anything. Ok. Ok. Awesome. The next question was about how many activities per subject can students expect a week? So again, that's gonna be dependent on their start and end date. As far as the continuous course, it'll automatically pace everything out for them. But if there is a pacing guide at the top of the course for K through two or externally for these other courses, that'll help you just get an idea of what's due and how much is due and then how can the teacher see what standards are covered that's gonna be in that editor. But of course, if you have any questions on how to get back there, let me know and I'll show that again. Sophia, was there any questions in the chat that were not covered in the spreadsheet or what we just discussed? No, I believe you covered it all. Ok. Awesome. Did anybody else have any remaining questions? I have. Oh, go ahead. Ok, real quick. Um, I just added a question. I don't even know if you can see it yet, but are we able to get a copy of that required reading list? Like the books that are required? Yeah. Um, lita, I will send an email over to you and then however you want to make that available. I'll let that be up to Epic. Ok. Thanks. And thank you. Of course. I think someone else had a question at the same time. It, was that the same one or do you have a different one? Uh, yeah, I just kind of maybe wanted your input or some, maybe some other, uh, if there's any other special education, uh, Epic teachers. I've got kind of mixed reviews from teachers who have used. Right. Thinker in the past. Um, some of them are like, it's overwhelming that the additional, uh, like supplies and stuff that they'll need, you know, offline in the curriculum and then some people, um, are like, no, it's usually just like basic stuff that's laying around the house, like for science experiments or for other projects and different subjects. Um I'm primarily gonna be using this for my K through eighth grade uh classes. So, um, did you have any, any thoughts on that? I do. Yes, I do. So, we have gotten that feedback from a lot outside of just epic. And this year was one of the major changes that the curriculum team has gone in and updated the courses and I know they're just gonna continue to be updating them. Um But they have gone in and made more accessible um labs. So let me go in here and show you Sophia. Do you remember the specific courses that they made changes to? I don't have the list on hand. I don't. Exactly, but I can check on my side also. Ok, let me see if I can find an example. Let's talk about them. Ok. So they've gone in, I think it was the higher grade levels in eighth grade, which is not helping you specifically. I'm sorry about that. But I, they might have changed eighth grade as well. Um But I know that they're going in and they're making more virtual labs, more things accessible to students that are um at home, not using the labs specifically in a classroom. Um But if you still see any remaining labs, you are more than welcome to hide them and if you have other labs that you'd like to use, please feel free to do that. But I know that the curriculum team is going in and they're updating some of those so that they are more accessible because there are a few that require things like um a balance beam that students might not have access to or a microscope and different things like that. So, ok, that was my kind of my follow up thought there was maybe to just omit it if it was too complicated and that won't have too big of an impact on. I mean, it'll have an impact but not too big of an impact on their grade or. Well, I guess if you admit it, it won't have any impact on their grade but correct, but it wouldn't be hindering them from learning anything for like a specific quiz or la um test or anything like that. All the labs are separate. So the quizzes will just cover the lessons themselves and then the practice and unit test will cover the quizzes and um lessons. OK. Good, good to know. And it's really easy to going through the editor to add a dry lab too if you wanted to. Um So if you have like a video like on youtube, that maybe corresponds to what the lab was, you can upload that with some questions that they can then do in lieu of the lab that's listed there. OK. Good idea. In that advanced workshop, we'll be covering more in depth on the different types of activities. You can create how to do those groupings, more in depth, how everything applies to each other. So in the meantime, from this um meeting to the next, if you have any questions for LITA or you're like, I really wanna learn more advanced on this. Please let us know and we'll make sure to cover that in the next training and we'll keep the spreadsheet open. So if you uh go away and come back with some more questions, you can update that spreadsheet and we'll definitely keep looking at that for uh the next training as well. Awesome. I just wanted to give a couple of seconds to make sure nobody had any other questions, but it seems like they've all been answered. So me and Lida will meet together before our next meeting and make sure that I'm aware of all of the settings that you'll have access to as far as um in regards to your administrative training or your administrative application so that I can fully answer all your questions. We'll go in more in depth as far as um the different types of activities you can create in epic specifics. And then as long as everybody has access to that epic quick start guide, I think that will be very beneficial to you. All the required reading actually might be right within that quickstart guide if I remember correctly but um I will send that in an email to LITA and then she will inform you on where that is available. But thank you for all your time today. It has been a pleasure and yes, le to put in the chat. The next meeting is Wednesday, August 10th and I have one, just one note about that August 10th. I believe that is a professional development epic professional development day. Ok. Does that mean you all have a lot of other trainings that day as well? Yeah, we have to travel to Oklahoma City that day, but the way they do it now, I think it's just by teams. I'm not sure if it's everyone. Uh Luta, do you know, will we just watch the recording if, if that's the case? Yes, I'll definitely make sure everything's recorded and available and if you wanted to, if you've got questions that you want us to cover and you're not able to go, you can always add up to that spreadsheet and we'll make sure that we cover it in, in the course as well. Ok. Awesome. Thank you for the input. I had no idea. So, yes, the next meeting would be August 10th at 1 p.m. If you're welcome. If you're able to join, we would love to have you. But of course, if not, we'll report it again and make sure you get that. That is all I have to share for you today. Lida. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? Um No, I just thank you guys for joining us and having these great questions and conversations. It's definitely we wanna make sure it's tailored for what you guys need. So awesome. Thank you so much.\"), (1867, 495, 3431, \"Have on Epic. So Lita started the recording. I'm just gonna reexplain for those that are not here today. And my name is Megan. I'm a part of bright thinkers, professional development team. We're gonna be walking through the student's application as far as what they can submit, what they're able to see on their side, all of the different features within Epic. And then we'll also look at a teacher's end and everything that you have a accessible through Epic, you all have a specific role. And so especially if you are a returning teacher and you notice something or you have a question about something, please don't hesitate to take your microphone off or throw something in the chat and just let us know specific Epic things. Um And then of course, if you have any questions that are regarding Epic specific leader will be throughout the chat as well. Um So Lena mentioned that y'all have a spreadsheet that was shared with us, which is questions for bright thinker. Um And it looks like yes, I'm still sharing my screen so you're able to see it. And these are just a few of the questions that came in. So we're actually gonna walk through the demo first because it's just basics of what it looks like and then we'll come back to the questions. So if you have any, please throw those in the chat or for Sophia or Lita and then you can also add to that spreadsheet and I should get updates. Um, but if not, if you don't see your question updated, just let me know at the end. All righty. So this is what it looks like for anyone in bright thinker when they click log in. Um As a teacher, you might see a couple different permission sets, you should as an epic teacher have the option as an administrator or a teacher. Mine says student because I'm enrolled as a student. Um So we're gonna start on that side when you're in the course. I'm actually gonna change my color really quick. I like it at blue. It's less distracting for me. Um But I know y'all's color is orange. So when we start as a student logging into the platform in the top left hand corner, it will highlight that the student is on their courses tab, they also have the option to click over to the to do list and this will show them anything past due at the beginning and then the next seven calendar days due from there. And I just wanted to remind as well as we're walking through here. Please do not hesitate to take off your microphone or talk in the chat and ask any questions as we're moving along in the platform. So these are all quick links for those students. They can click right into here and actually access that lesson. You'll notice that it's not showing the lesson for the student just because there's an activity due before this one and this one is just the getting started video. So we'll talk a little bit more into that in depth, but I'm gonna stay on the to do list for now. So these are all quick links. The student can work right from here. It will tell them the due date and most of the courses in epic are continuous courses, which means that the course will automatically pace out for the students giving them targeted due dates. So they're not hard set dates. These are just going to pace out depending when the student needs to end the course. By the last thing on the top, on these tabs that the student can click on is their activity stream. This is going to be a notification center for the students. So this is where they can come to see any feedback left by a teacher. If they have a new score updated, anything the student would need to be notified of as well. You can see click click links here. So any time you see a blue hyperlink as a student, you can click right in there and it'll either give you the feedback for the new score you earned. And then if I were to click on one of these titles that would bring me right into that lesson or quiz, I'm gonna click back over to my courses tab on the left hand side in order to navigate back to my courses. So this is exactly what it looks like, right? When they logged in, they'll always see the updated day and then the announcements to the right. So anytime a administrator at the top level, meaning lita or someone with an epic at a higher level has posted an announcement for everybody to see teachers and students. Or if you have as a teacher have posted an announcement, the student will be notified here and they'll be able to click and be able to see that announcement. It will notify them of who this came from. So my name in the site is Bright Thinker, but this would say the teacher's name who it was given to. So this is the course and then the date it was created and when it expires, you'll notice it automatically brought the student to the communication tab. This is something they can find in their hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. I'm gonna click back. We'll notice that it brought us right down to communication. I'm gonna click back into the home icon and how I got there was that announcements right from the home page. So speaking of that hamburger menu. We're actually gonna walk through there first. So I'm gonna click back up there in the top left hand corner and the first option down from the home icon is the grades for the student. So this is gonna be their overall grades. If they're enrolled in four courses, all four will populate here. They have that quick link to their course. They also have a heart icon. This allows the students to click and drag their understanding interest and effort levels to update their teacher on how they're feeling. And of course, there's four options within each bar and they can come in here and update this as much as they'd like. It will also list any teachers enrolled in the course and then they have two different progress bars when hovered over, it'll tell them the total number in each progress. This one has 43 on the right and this one has 37. The first one is just gradable activities. So anything included in the students final score, the other one is going to include any non gradable activities as well such as coloring pages, objectives, like getting started video, something that the student wouldn't require a grade for, but it's still an active activity they must mark as complete in order to finish the course. They can also view on the top left hand corner where it's highlighted as courses, any of their past courses. So I've been enrolled in quite a bit of past courses, but this is where I can come and see any scores. I previously earned my current status in that course. And then the progress and the time that I spent there, I click back over to the courses tab where the student would be and anytime they see this print icon, they have the ability to print this out. So it'll just give them that summary of the page that they're on. I'm gonna go back in the main menu and underneath here is the notes tab. So this is where students will hold such as a digital notebook. And any time they're in the lesson, they have an ability to take a permanent note where they can take notes on any of the content. They're learning to remind themselves of anything such as if they had a physical notebook in a in person class, just gives them the ability to come back here and have access to anything. They took notes while learning a lesson back in that main menu underneath the notes tab is the communication that's where we were brought earlier from the announcements notification. They can click through and see any announcements that has been posted by a teacher and or admin back in that main menu underneath the communication is gonna be the calendar again with those continuous courses, it will pace out for the student so they can come here and click anywhere they see the color coordinate dot with each course, anything due for that course, any blackout dates will also populate for the student and it will notify them that nothing is due on those days. So that's gonna be any holidays assessed by your administrators and already input into the main domain for you. But when the student is enrolled in multiple courses, they'll have different courses listed beneath with all of the different color dots for them. And these are also quick links. So if the student wanted to work right from their calendar, they could click right in here and begin working for the day. I'm gonna click back in the top left hand corner and down to student resources. This is the last option that a student has in their main menu. It's all of the frequently asked questions by students in the platform, especially if they're brand new to bright thinker all via video. But then at the very bottom, we also have a PDF option depending on the student's preference. Teachers and administrators also have this tab in their main menu. Should you need it? Um Just so you can help direct the students if they get a little lost in the platform. Lastly, underneath all of the main options, we then have a dark gray bar and all of the courses that the students enrolled in so that they can click right from here and begin working in their course. Should they want to from the main menu? I'm gonna use that home icon. And then that way we can look at what a course card is. So we call this rectangle of course card. It includes an image to coordinate with the course that the students enrolled in as well as the course title. And then these dates right here are gonna show unique to the student. The first and last day they can submit work in the course. Once they actually begin working, they'll have a current score populate here. And then the progress bar will actually also darken as they move along in the course. And then at the very bottom, we have a play button that will bring them right into the activities or the bar graph icon will bring them to their grades specific to this course. So we're gonna click on that play button and then the student will automatically see a few things here. So all of those same course details from the main page, but then to the right, they will be able to see their score right here once it populates, I haven't begun working. So I don't have one yet. The great icon again here. And then the eyeball feature allows the student to click and hide their score. So if they had a score previously right here, it'll just disappear as there's nothing there. It's not gonna change their grade in any way. It's actually just going to hide it from them if they're discouraged in any way or they just don't want to see their sport at this time. And then underneath they, they have a more in depth progress. So they're able to see by percentage and one hovered over the exact amount out of total that they have completed as far as activities in this course underneath, there is going to be the welcome page or the landing page. This is specific to each teacher. So once we switch over to the teacher, we'll show you how you can customize this. It's utilized in many different ways across the board. You can use this as a static announcement. You can include a Zoom link, any youtube videos, any text and images that you'd like to make unique to your course, just what you whatever you'd like the students to see as soon as they log into their course and then scrolling down, the student will then see the full entire course, all one through 10 units. If it's a core course under that activities page to the right. They have another quick snapshot of their to do list just for this course. And then they also have course links. These are all unique to this course as well. They can be included by the teacher as extra resources or anything you should want to show the student. When clicked on, it's just going to populate a new tab. We used our bright thinker site as an example. But again, you can use this for extra resources for math, reading anything you'd like, I'm gonna click back over to the activities and then the student can either start at the up next activity at the very top or they can open a unit folder and begin working at the first activity there. The getting started video is going to be in all of the courses for the student. It's just a quick walk through of the platform in case the student has never been a bright thinker before, they would click mark this activity as complete in the bottom left hand corner and then they would be able to move to the next activity by scrolling to the right hand side. Once here, this is actually going to show the next unit uh just a quick preview of what's coming up because we haven't yet begun working in this unit folder. So I'll click on that first activity. And in here, we've actually up included an upload example for fourth grade science. So this is a science journal activity requesting that the student create a cover page for their science journal and then a table of contents and all of the safety rules encompassing here. So as a student after I have finished my work, I have a couple different ways that I can upload in the platform. You can either click right into this text box and it will populate a ton of different options for the students. One being this picture icon that allows you to insert an image right from your device. So you can either click and drag an image right here. You can upload by URL or using this um camera icon. You can capture right from your device. If you have a webcam applicable, then the student also has the option to insert a video or audio. They can text right within the box, oops or they can use the plus button in the big blue circle in the bottom right hand corner allowing them to attach a file right from their device. So there's many different ways that the students can upload work. I'm gonna use your course list as an example and then I'll upload there. Once the student has uploaded, they can confirm before submitting their work that this is what they intended to upload. If they are not trying to submit this for their work, they clicked on the wrong activity, they can simply remove before they submit and select the correct image instead. But I like what I have. So I'm going to submit my work and then a few things will change for the student here. It's going to notify them. They have successfully submitted the assignment and the button now changes to resubmit my work into instead of submit. So is there a limit for the size of the file that they can upload? Um We, I would have to actually look into that. Lita let me take a note of that. We haven't run into any issues where students have tried to upload it too big of a file. Um I'm sure there is a limit but it's probably greater than anything a student would try to be submitting. That's a great question though. I'm gonna follow up on that just in case. All right. So that's how a student would submit work. And then if you scroll back just a little bit to the top, you can now see that the status has changed to completed slash submitted. And they'll see this little paper icon. Anytime a student sees this paper icon also in the top right hand corner in the platform, that means that there's either a portion of the activity or the entire activity requires something to be graded by the teacher. So they do not have the full grade yet. It's not an automatic submission by the platform. So they're waiting on a grade in here in order to move to the next activity, they can either use the toggle arrows in the top left hand corner or scroll to the bottom and use the next activity button in the bottom right hand corner from here. This is an example from first grade social studies. So it's gonna look a little bit different than those older grade levels for K through two, if we have any K through two teachers in here. Um This is just going to show you an overview how the difference the students have in that they'll learn just a little bit of the content and then answer those questions here instead of on the older grade levels, it's actually going to all encompass on one page and all of the content will be at the top and then they'll scroll to the bottom and review section in the bottom. So this was intended hopefully to hold that focus of the students as they're learning and cause less distractions instead of having it all on one page. And you will notice this is a good thing to take note of. Um these videos are not required to be watched. So if I was a student and I got to this last page and I decided I don't want to watch the video, I can click next um that they are able to watch that video if they would like none of the videos in Bright Finger are going to exceed three minutes. That is because they're intended to assist with learning but not teach the lessons themselves. So I'm gonna click next. Once the student hits this review page, they will see a check mark in the bottom right hand corner of each question, ensuring they have answered all of the questions, I'll click submit in the bottom right hand corner and then it'll give the student one last chance. So just make sure they don't wanna go back and check any questions before submitting, but I'm ok. So I'm gonna submit and then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, I automatically have earned a grade for this. That is because there was nothing open ended or essay, nothing to upload. So the teachers are not required to provide a grade before the student sees their answers or I'm sorry before they see their score. So if the student either can click jump to submission up here in the top left hand corner or they can scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll just bring them down here. There is a section called view grade details and this is where the student is able to see a quick snapshot of everything entitled in their course. So their score, the status is now completed, the targeted due date versus the date they submitted as well as the active amount of time they worked on that lesson before clicking submit. They can also then click over to the questions tab and the lower grade level students will have to click through in order to see their questions per number. Um But this is where they can come and see what they answered and the question score and you'll notice that this is actually exactly what an epic student sees um because I have changed all the settings to match. And so the student will see their answer and the score after the first submission, I'm gonna go back. They also have a submission history. It's just a quick snapshot for the student to be able to see if they submit again, then they'll see the second version here with the unique details of that second submission. So I'm gonna go back really quick since it's a first grade and resubmit my work so that you can see what happens after the second attempt. Um The students will always have this retake button available that to them for anything encompassing in the lessons category, which means lessons, activities, practice not included in the practice test, project skills and they have an unlimited number of attempts with epic. So they can click retake here in the bottom right hand corner and the activity will look as if this unit had never submitted. So they would go back through, provide a new answer or the same answer depending on their first round. And then oops, I missed a couple there. I think I skipped over number three. Yeah. All righty. And then once I click submit here, my new score will pop in the top right hand corner. So when I go down to my submission area and my view my grade details in the submission history, I can now see the 1st and 2nd version and the scores I earned the 1st and 2nd time. I'm gonna click back on the X air in the X in the top left hand corner. And then I'm gonna talk all to the next activity from here as the students are working in the platform. They also will have a couple different options to help assist as they're learning. So in the top right hand corner, you'll notice in the toolbar, we have a highlighter is the first option. Now, depending on which device you're on, it will allow you to either just drag over and that will highlight some devices require you to drag and click enter. Um So just be aware of that as students are working in the platform, the highlighter can be utilized in the content itself or in the review section. So this is a great example of how K through two is a little bit different than those older grade levels. This one came from an eighth grade course. So you'll notice how everything is on one page with the vocabulary at the top, the content itself and then the review section at the very bottom, they also have an eliminator to the right of the highlighter. This is going to give that visual process of elimination on multiple choice questions. So when hovering over, they'll see that little X and this will allow the student to visually cross out any answers, they are sure are wrong. The student accidentally clicks on one of the correct answers. No big deal at all. They can either just click that right back off or if they select that answer choice, it will take it off for them to the right of the answer eliminated. They will have the print feature. This is printing prior to submission. So they will be able to work on paper should they need to. Um but they would still be required to go back in and answer digitally on the platform to the right of the print feature. Then we have text to speech which will open up a full panel of options. So I'll go to the top so we can look at a couple of these options. You have the pointer finger which will allow the student to select where they would like the platform to begin reading. An assumption is a statement that is accepted. They also have the play button that will read from the very top of the um lesson itself and read up to 1000 words. They would then need to use the point your finger to continue. Should it exceed past those 1000 words past that we have the stop and pause button and then the translator. So this can do anything from a sentence to a word to a phrase to a paragraph. Um I'll just do one word here and then we can click the translator button up in the top right hand corner and this will translate the word for them. It looks like it's clicking on the wrong one. Let me try that again. So now let me check my settings really quick. Sorry about that. So mine's translating from English to Spanish. Let me try a fool. Freeze here. There we go. So it's gonna translate to the language specified in the settings which we'll get into in just a minute and it will read out for up to 18 of the most common languages. Some of them will only translate the text itself. I next to the translator is going to be a dictionary. So it will give a definition of a word or phrase highlighted. We then also have a picture icon to go along with all of the words in the platform. Next to that will be the screen mask, which is one of my personal favorites. This will allow the student to focus as they're reading through the platform. I used to do this with a bookmark on actual textbook. So it's nice to see this in a digital platform as well. And then last but not least we have the magnifier which coordinates with the pointer icon and will magnify the words as it reads to the students. Emotional appeals often use loaded language or last icon next to that is actually a highlighter. So very similar to the one that we have within the platform already. But this will actually give a couple different colors which is very useful in English or some of those higher level grade levels that need to annotate or use different colors. Um So you can just highlight over where you need to and click the color you'd like to use and then you'll notice the gear icon. This will allow you in the general settings to change the voice speed, the text highlighter color, the magnifier size as well as the speech mode. And then we have the translation button. This is where you can select which language it's translating from English to another language. And you'll notice this little um microphone or loud icon that just lets you know that it's actually going to speak that language to the student. Otherwise it will only translate the text to them. Then we also have screen tools. So if you'd like to change the reading light color, so this is just specifically for the reading mask, so I'll change it just so we can see what it looks like. And the student actually is able to open that screen mask and then change what it looks like. So they can decide actually that's not what I actually wanted there. Um And then they can do anything to their preference here and then should they not like anything, they can reset it back to the default. And we do have a PDF explaining everything that I just went through in detail. Should you need to share that with a student or go back and research your steps as you're walking through it on your own, any time you see the paper, airplane icon that's going to be communication form for the student. So as long as the teacher and the student both have an email within the platform, they will be able to send a message to this, the teacher keeping in mind this is going to go to every teacher enrolled in the platform. Um but they can ask a question right from here and it will send straight to the teacher's inbox of whatever email is specified in their profile last. But not least we have that notes icon, sticky note at the very top. Anytime you see it in the student tools that's gonna be a permanent note and it allows the student to take a note and it will save in that digital um notebook that we saw earlier in the notes tab of the main menu. So they can um either copy and paste into the platform of the notes or they can type right within here and then it'll time stamp it for them, tell them where it came from and then they can click right to their notes from here as well if they'd like to. But I'm gonna click through the questions at the bottom. Um Just so we can move on to the next activity and you can see what this looks like. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to take off your microphone or throw them in the chat. And Sophia will either answer them or let us know and we can talk through them as well. Can you delete um activities or lessons if you needed to? Absolutely. Sorry. Go ahead to modify for a student. Yes, absolutely. So we can go in a little bit in depth of it, specifically what Epic prefers as well. But once we get to the teacher's side, I'll show you the editor and you have freedom to hide activities. And so that will essentially excuse for all of the students that'll take it out of their preview. The only reason we recommend to not delete is just because especially if students had already begun working in the platform and it will delete all of the scores they previously earned. But that's a great question. All righty. So you all will notice um we had a few automatic grading options at the top of the activity. But then we also have some open end questions. We just wanted to put this in here so we can show you what it would look like for a student. So they will see that same icon indicating that something needs to be graded by a teacher and they will not be able to see a score until that is given by the teacher, but they can still see the review section. So everything they provided an answer for and then the text box at the very bottom um for the ones that had the and now last year lita I don't know if it's just on my side. I know you were asking a question but you were cutting out quite a bit. So I wasn't able to hear what it was. Yeah, there, there's some classes that have the guided notes, I can remember what they're called. Are they available this year or is that not till next year? Yes. So the accommodated courses are what you're referring to. I believe those are actually only going to have a reduced number of questions per ques quizzes practices and unit test. So they are available. Um Those are completely separate courses that would need to be added in. Um but they will be containing five questions across all quizzes and then 10 questions a across all practice and unit tests. Thank you, of course. All right. So at the sa the bottom, all those same options are gonna be here in order to view the grade details, see the targeted duty and when it was submitted and then they have that retake button available to them. I'm gonna click the next activity from here and this is actually going to be an example for once we get over to the teacher side. So I'm actually gonna skip this lesson and move on. I messed up. I forgot to allow myself to move on. So let me go ahead and submit this really quick and then I will be able to show you a quiz. All righty. So Epic does only allow two attempts per quiz for students. So it doesn't mean that the student can never take it past the two attempts. This is just prior to teacher intervention. So as a teacher, you'll always be able to go in and allow additional retries past those two attempts. But this is what the student will automatically receive. So when they click start, they will need to submit um require an answer per question and they will have to submit all at once. They don't have the ability to answer this question, leave and come back. Anytime a student leaves the assessment, they get kicked out via internet or issues or anything else that happens, the platform will. So let's say the student only answered this first question, the platform will submit for them, but it will never submit an answer for them. So it'll just all be marked blank. So they'll see the blank in the review section and then there'll be a um everything will be answered or marked as incorrect as far as the blank answers. So you'll be able to confirm, ok, there was probably an internet issue or they backed out of the quiz before they were done. The platform will never select an answer for the student. So I'll quickly go through and click so that you all can see the difference of what a student can see for the first admission versus the second. Um But as we'd asked earlier, there is something that we call an accommodated course offering this year. So it's brand new. Um And with those, all of the quizzes will only have five questions versus how you see here. This quiz has. I believe it's about 20 yeah, 20 questions So we're gonna click next. All of those are available. So I'm gonna click submit. So after I submit, there's no questions to display here. Um I got a 50% automatically and then I can view my grade details from here. I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. And then now everything that I have provided a submission for, I can see that green check mark indicating I've completed that activity, close that out and then this is just a full instructional unit so that you could see what it would look like outside of our examples. So this is third grade science unit two. It's gonna have about three lessons until it hits that first quiz. All of the activities, labs following pages will be sp sprinkled throughout the unit itself and then at the very bottom, they'll have a practice test and new unit test before they reach that next unit. Very similar. This is English one. Obviously, the grades are drastically different. Um But the flow of the course is about the same. So I'm gonna click back on my main menu in the top left hand corner. Now that I'm in a course, I have a different sub menu you'll notice. So I can click into my activities or grades from here because I'm already in this specific course. So the grades for each course, this is where a student can come see their overall score. There are different percentages for progress. And then if they scroll down to the bottom, they'll be able to see each line item submitted versus targeted due due date, the status and the score here. They also in the top left hand corner, have a dashboard, they can click on and then I'll just give a quick overview as well as the activity, which is a almost the far right, but about the middle and this will show the student exactly how long when they started working in each activity and then the total amount of time spent in this course, click back on that grades and then the main menu in the top left hand corner, they can either use these toggles, um icons in the top to navigate back to that regular menu or they can use that arrow to be able to see everything from here. So now that I took notes in that course, they populate here for me and I can actually click right back into the course I was working on. We use that main menu to go back to the student application. And then the last thing I'd like to show you on the student side is in the top right hand corner. The student's name will populate here again. Mine is just right thinker in the platform, they can click and get a couple of different options from here. Choose theme is gonna be the second one. This is where they can come and change their color theme. Now, of course, this can change at any time throughout the school year. If administrators at the top level of the domain decide they don't want students to do this, there's a couple of things they can turn on and off. Um But lady can correct me if I'm wrong. I believe the students currently have the ability to change the color and they also can choose their color scheme, meaning if they use the drop down option, they can change to a dark color scheme. So I'll do an obvious different color, like green and then the color will change everything such as their banners, their menu, anything that coordinates and then the dark color scheme have now changed everything that was once a light gray or a white color to a darker color. Um So this helps a lot with students that have headaches or issues with being on a computer for a long extended amount of time. Um But they definitely don't have to turn that on if they don't want to Megan walls just to show them how they share the calendar with their parents lito you're cutting out again for me how they view the calendar for their parents. Is that what you said? Well, I know that last year, the calendar Google calendar so their parents can see when things are due. Understood. Yes. So the students actually have the ability to go to their calendar. So I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner again down to the calendar icon and they will see these arrows in a circle and this allows them to sync and it will give them information on how to sync with their Google calendar. So it'll give all the due dates straight to their Google calendar. The only thing is they will not be able to click right from their Google calendar into the lesson. It doesn't um flow quite that well yet. Um But it will just show up the due dates in their Google calendar. So they're able to see it in both places. Um Teacher, I knew that this was really helpful. This would have been really helpful for my parents. I don't know what's due. I don't know when we was everybody able to hear lita on that one. No, I think you're sounds cutting out for everybody lita, but I was about to, I was able to piece it together. I think she was just intending that this is very useful for the students with Epic and the parents being able to see that calendar that the stu I guess, do the parents have access on their side to see their Google calendar maybe. And so it's a lot easier for them to be able to see that instead of having the students log in and showing them everywhere that everything's due. Yes. And you should be able to uh make that link of the calendar and the, that calendar in there. Um, as well. I lost little pieces, but I think I fully understand what you're saying. They're able to connect the calendars. So, yes, just that, those two arrows in a circle that allows them to see the options of how they'll sync those calendars. It's pretty easy. I've done it on my side. It gives you all the information right here and then they can connect those on their end. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you on the student application again where their name is in the top right hand corner, clicking down to see the first option is settings as a student. This will be all of the user details that were given to me once I was created as a user. But on the right hand side, I can put in any email or mobile number that I'd like with the coordinating carrier. So we see this a lot for parents and they can be notified of any of the following student notifications. So they would input their email and or mobile number, select their carrier and then come down here and they can choose either text or email depending on the notification. And then either daily or weekly of when the enrollment status changes, their grade drops below passing if they submitted an activity. Um someone replies to a discussion post. This is more in the high school level courses, not really in the younger grade. Levels. Um But if they're ever awarded a badge or they receive a score or feedback. So this is a great way to immediately connect with the parent's email and or number and just get notified of these few options here. And then the students also have the option to select from the avatar list. Should they want to pick an image for their profile and then they would just click save and refresh their browser to update anything that they had changed before we move on over to the teacher application? Did anybody have any questions of what we have covered or have not as far as the student application, you may have said this, but can they access um their activities from their calendar? Uh kind of like the to do list? Are they actually able to access from the calendar as well? Yes, absolutely. So if they select a day that actually has something to do with that color dot Anything they highlight over, they'll be able to click right in there and be able to work right from the calendar. And I will know um I don't have anything double due right now. But if they had multiple activities for one course, they would just have a little carrot button here and they would just click to expand and then they can click on each specific activity from there. OK. I have a, I have a question. Yes, ma'am. Um Is there like a standard or does it vary by grade level like this? Right. Thinker. Try to give students two activities a week per subject. Um, or does it just fluctuate depending on subject? And then, uh, the, the part where you showed where t where that you can sign up a parent's email address? J what's your, I'm sorry? Um, where you can set up the kid, the parents email address? Is that something that teachers can set up for them or would without having to log in through the parent portal? I mean, the student portal. Uh No, ma'am. So unfortunately, the notification settings will only be per user. So they would have to do that in their own settings per student. Um But they're very quick to access. So as soon as the student logs in, they can just click right from their name to the settings and then it's all right here for them. I was wondering if there was a way to lock that once you put in a email or a phone number. So the student couldn't go in and remove it. There's not. So it gives w freedom just for the ability. Should they put the wrong one in or they need to update it? It's there for them. Um But then back to your first question, Nadia, uh as far as pacing for the students, um can I ask which grade level you're teaching? Uh all, all grades? Sure. That's usually the answer for epic teachers. I just wanted to ask. Um Just because as of actually today, um the K through two courses have been given, let me go in here and find it so we can look at the same time. So if you're teaching K through two in the activities as a teacher, you'll see this course resource folder at the very top, you'll notice it's automatically hidden from the students. Should you want to show anything to the students you'll need to go in and allow students to see that. Um But within here, they have given an optional pacing guide. So this will help assist walking through the platform and knowing when things should be due. Um This is just kind of a basis should you need it? But if you're using a continuous course, it will pace out for the student. So with the continuous course, it's unique to each student. Of course, if one student starts in August and another student starts in September and they're still gonna take the entire course, they're gonna have a few more things due. Um But it really depends usually with the grades three through 12, it seems to be about one activity per day. But again, it's really dependent on the subject matter and what needs to be completed and things like that. Is it easy to modify those assignments for our fed kids? Like reduce questions or reduce answer choices? Yes, absolutely. So not on the teacher end and it might depend on what your uh um abilities within the administrator application are. So we'll look at those together once we switch over to the teacher side. Um but there's four accommodations that an administrator can set to each user. So with that, let me go over here. So when you have access to the users tab at the very bottom of the details, this is the four accommodations that can be set per user and this is across all of their courses. So never automatically assign zeros that's not going to be on anything by default. That's if a teacher goes into their course and decides they want to automatically assign zeros after past due activities, this student wouldn't be affected. You can also ignore any time limits on assessments. Should there be any also always allow speech stream that has been turned on across the board for epic? But should a teacher want to turn it off per course or per activity, then the student will still have access and then you can also limit the number of options on multiple choice questions. So if I put two here, then this student would only ever see two options across all multiple choice questions. But the another option that just became new available this year is those accommodated courses which will reduce those number of questions across all quizzes and practice tests and unit tests for students. Ok. This, that's fantastic. Um Can you just tell me one more time how you got here. And so this is just, you're just modifying this for Aaron Sullivan, right? So if I had 2/5 graders, one could have these accommodations and the other could go without them. Correct. Yes, ma'am. These are unique to each user. Um I didn't explain how I got here just because I wanted to make sure with lita that y'all had the ability to do this or is this something that you'll have to request by? Epic? Y'all do have specific teacher admin level permissions. Um But just because the school year ended, I wasn't ab actually able to see exactly what y'all have permissions on. Um And with, I'm not able to share my screen right now and show just because I would be showing student data if I were to go into y'all's actual site. So in your administrative settings, if you have the ability, you would just access. Um So right when you log in, you get the option of an admin or a teacher. If you accidentally click on teacher or you're already working in the teacher platform, you can use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner and that will allow you to switch over from admin to teacher if you're enrolled in as a student, that's how you'd switch to a student as well. So you'll want to be in the admin app and then you'll use that main menu and click down to the users tab and these are all fake students. I'm still in the training site. Um But you would click on the user id of your student and then scroll to the bottom and it's all right there for you. The only reason I say this is, I believe the last time that this was asked, y'all didn't have access to it so you can view it when it's here, but everything is grayed out. I don't know if that's been changed or not or if you all have access to it, but if you don't and it's all grayed out, you would just request that from Lida and, or another administrator. It's not lita um and they can come in here and add these accommodations per user for you. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I'm gonna switch back to the student app really quick. Did anyone else have any remaining questions before we switched over to the teacher's side? Megan? I wanted to mention, did you want to show the calendar how they can filter per day, week and month? Absolutely. That's a great one, Sophia. So I'm gonna go back to the calendar icon. Uh I'm sorry, calendar tab in the main menu. Um What Sophia was referring to is that if a student was on a specific day. So right now it's just gonna show the day that I'm clicking on. But if I come up here in the right hand corner where it labels the day, I can switch down to a week. So then if I'm just on this week, it'll still show me that Friday due date. If I click into this week, it'll show me everything due for this week or I can even show myself an entire month. That way the student doesn't have to be on the day and click into each day in order to see everything. Do. Thank you, Sophia. Of course, we have one more question from Andrea. Can we omit an activity for specific students and keep it for others? Yes, absolutely. So we'll just go ahead and switch over to the teacher side. A lot of the questions I think y'all are asking even prior to the training were in regards to the editor. So we'll go in there and look in that and then you all can see all of the different options of what you have for students. I'm gonna flick right back really quick. Is this where you were looking? Sophia was on the Yes and the chat. OK, perfect. I just wanted to make sure there was no questions in regards to the student application before I moved on student application looks good. All right. So again, in order to switch over to a different permission set from admin teacher student, you would use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner next to your name and then click over to switch. Um I forgot that I didn't enroll myself as a teacher So I'm actually going to log in as a teacher that I enrolled in the course. So one second, early credit. 223. Ok. All right. So this is very similar to what yours should look like. You should have admin or teacher. I'm gonna click into the teacher side and you'll notice everything looks very similar on the teacher's application that's intended so that if the students ever get lost or you need help with anything, nothing looks foreign to you. Everything is the same across the board, especially when you switch over to the administrative application as well. So I know that y'all had a lot of questions in the editor in order to get there. I'm gonna cover a couple of steps first. I just wanna make sure y'all didn't think I was forgetting about you. Um But right when you log in as a teacher, you'll still have that date here. And then um what's really great about this platform is that you'll have the needs grading right on your home page for you. So you'll have a notification of how many you have left to grade. You'll notice it's a three. Even if I click in here, I don't provide a grade for anything and I click right back out. That three is gonna remain there for me until I provide a grade for each of those three submissions. That way you don't ever have to get confused if you graded something or not it's always gonna remind you right here. You also have that announcements tab as a teacher that'll bring you to communication tab where you'll notice that there's any new announcements provided by an admin or you or another teacher created a new announcement. Um Only the teachers that are enrolled in the same courses of you that will is what you'll be notified of. So you won't be notified of other teachers that aren't in your courses. So I'm gonna click on that needs grading tab. And on the left hand side, you'll be able to see the three submissions here. And I wanted to show you the difference between these. So the first one is that first upload, I uploaded. If you remember where we showed the difference between the text or if you could use right from your device or use the upload and I chose the upload. So this is what you see as a teacher, you'll see the student's name, the course it came from, the activity is actually a hyperlink so that you'll be able to click right in there and see what the students saw as they were submitting. And then you'll also have the targeted versus submitted date scrolling down. You'll be able to see the student attachments and it keeps it all in one clean box for you. And then at the very bottom, anytime you see comments with a gray box, this is what the student also provided in the text box and then at the very bottom is a rubric provided for you. So you can actually typewrite within here grading per um section. And then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, it automatically calculates for me on the activity itself, you'll notice it's highlighted on content, clicking over to score and activity history is where I can see how many times the student submitted or I'm sorry, this is actually how many times the student visited the activity with a time stamp. But then the submission history is where you'll see that how many times they actually submitted the activity. And then all the way over to the right is class statistics. This is only applicable when more than one student has submitted and when it's in has a portion of automatic grading. So we'll look at one of those in a little bit. Um But all the way over to the right, this is where you can provide a score for the student. So I actually use the rubrics at the bottom and I'd like to keep my score. So I'm just gonna click submit score and then in the on the right hand side, you'll notice that that score populates for the student. So a seven out of eight was an 87.5%. Now, if I use this refresh in the top right hand corner, that'll refresh my list and anything that I've already graded will take out for me. So it can clear up some of that clutter. But let's say that it didn't have a rubric. So any, this is a great example of anything that's open ended, including with some of the automatic grading. So if I scroll throughout here, I can see what the student answered and what they got correct based on those automatic grading questions. But then anything that I need to grade will come to the top. So I can either use those points section where I can provide a grade and it will automatically calculate the rest of the score for me based on what the student answered or I can use this section in the top right hand corner. I can allow full credit which will give 100%. Keeping in mind it's not 100% just for these two questions. I need to grade. It's for the whole activity. So it's superseding anything they already provided as a grade. You can also allow no credit or clear out the score. You can revert to calculated, which is gonna give me that calculated score based on what they earned. You can also excuse which will take this out of the final scoring for the student's grade. They'll no longer be required to have this a part of their grade. It will excuse in the grade book and then they will no longer see it on their side. You can allow a retry again. This is only necessary should they exceed their amount that they had. So for lessons, quizzes, practices and unit test, there's a different amount that they have, but the lessons are unlimited. So you'll never need a quick allow retry for unlimited. But for the quizzes, they have two. So if they need that third additional retry, you can provide that here. You'll also then have the option to override complete. This will accept that failing score in the grade book. Should there be a reason that the student is not allowed to move forward with Epic? They should be able to move forward within the platform regardless. Um But should you ever run into that issue? You can always click override complete and then that will allow them to move on. And then at the very bottom in the right hand panel, you'll see that very familiar text box where you can insert an image video or audio as well as any emojis or text. And this will leave feedback to the t to the student and they'll see that in their notification center. So I'll click submit score and then again, I'll see that score provided and you'll also see that text box icon, the click down to my last submission. And so this is where you'll see an example. If the student just types a period or a dot exclamation point and clicks enter, you'll see that in the comments. So the comments is anything that the student has provided as an answer, you'll be able to click over to the score and activity history as well as the submission again. And then all the way over to the right underneath the feedback box, you also have the option to edit templates. So this is templates for feedback, if you click edit, that will allow you to create a template. So I'm gonna make this one for if the student did a great job in here and then you'll click done and now you have that template. So when I exit back out, instead of having to type into each students, the same feedback, I can just click right on that template and submit a score. So you'll notice you can't leave feedback unless you've also provided a score and that will populate once you provide a score at the top and then at the very bottom underneath templates, you also have returned attachments. So if you need to upload a file to attach with their feedback to the student, you can do that here as well as create a private note for yourself. So it'll remind you it is that it is hidden from the student. Should you need to remind yourself of anything here? And then you would just click submit score and again, that student would earn their score. Does anyone have any questions in regards to providing a grade for anything uploaded or um provided by the student? I had a really quick question. It was on the lesson just previous to this one that you um are showing, I think you um how to say it, but the questions weren't in order like the ones that you had to actually gray rather than multiple choice. Um You were able to pull those to the top. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So let me go back and then can you share that again? Yes. So it's gonna look a little bit different since I already submitted the score. But anytime you see something in the needs grading tab and the students have a combination where something is automatically graded by the platform, let's say eight out of the 10 questions. But then those two questions required, a teacher answer those two will always come back to the top. Ok? So they'll always ok. All right. Very good. So anytime you're in that needs grading tab, these two questions will be at the top for you. So you don't have to go search through the questions to find out which ones they'll be. Ok. Thank you. I was thinking that that was the setting of some type but ok. Very good. No, it makes it easy for you. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. So back in the teacher app, we were in that needs grading tab. I graded everything so you can use that main menu and you'll notice that it brings you down to the Needs grading. It's just another way to get there, but I'm gonna click on the home icon to get back to the main page next to the needs. Grading to the right is the announcements tab. This is where you can come as a teacher, you'll notice it brings you straight to the communication again. It's just that quick link from your home page. So you don't have to go to the main menu. Should you not want to? Um But in the top right hand corner, you'll have this speech bubble. So it has three lines and when hovered over it says new announcement, I just zoomed in. So I'm gonna go back out a little bit so it looks normal. Um But you'll click on that new announcement and this is where you can choose. So I'm only enrolled as a teacher in one course. But if you're enrolled in more than one, which I'm sure you are, you'll have all of your courses listed here and then you can check on the check boxes for which courses you'd like this announcement to be. So you can do it for one course, for five, for 10, for all three. It just depends on what you'd like and then you'll have a start and end date or you can display it indefinitely. So you forever and then you can, it does require a subject and then that same text box. So you can include any images that you have a youtube video, any text or emoji emojis here and then you can even edit the text if you'd like, make it bigger, change the color and then you would click post in the top right hand corner and then you'll notice because I created this announcement, I can edit this announcement or delete it because these announcements were not my own. I don't have the ability to edit or delete them, but you can also always click through here and edit any ones that you've created at any time or delete them. And then you'll also notice in the top right hand corner you have that paper icon. I heard a little noise. I wanted to make sure that wasn't anybody asking a question. I don't know if it's just me hearing the noises or not, but I don't usually work with Zoom. So I'm not sure if that's like someone raising their hand or asking a question. But let me know on my side. So I think you think Sophia, I was just hearing like little bells. I don't know. OK. But anyways, so there's that little paper airplane that allows you to send mail to your students. Or if you scroll, you can select a specific student enrolled in that course. Again, the student and yourself would need to have an email in your details page of your profile, not the notification that's separate. And then um you would need to re it requires a subject and then you can send a copy to yourself as well if you'd like. And this will send straight to the students email inbox. And then I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner to go back to my home icon again. So those were all the quick links right from your page. And then as a teacher in the top right hand corner, you have managed courses which is a little double sheet of paper. And the first drop down option is to order your courses. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course, but the more courses you have, they'll populate here and you can click and drag and reorder the courses so that you can select which courses populate at the top for you. So if you have a, let's say English courses that you need to provide more grades in or some other courses that you need to be more active in, you can bring them all to the top because I know y'all are enrolled in quite a bit of courses sometimes and then scrolling through here could be time consuming. So you can order those forces from that first icon in the top right hand corner. You can also view past courses from here at the very bottom. Should you ever need to? So you still have all the same icons and you can click right into that course and view anything you need. And then lastly, you also have the ability to view slash delete courses. Um So again, we highly highly recommend never deleting anything in brighter because you never know if that's gonna delete all the scores, the grade book, anything that you need in there. Um But this is where you can just hide the course from your title. So let's say that you're still enrolled for another month, but that was little excessive for you. You didn't need it for another month and you just don't no longer want it on your page. You can just hide that from yourself. And then when you go to your home page, it's just no longer showing for you. So let's say you had 10 horses and you wanna hide five of them from yourself so that they're no longer cluttering your page. You can do that and you can always come back and unhide it from yourself as well. All the way over to the right where your name is as a teacher, you can click down and you'll have the same settings. So you also have a notification preferences very similar to the student email and or mobile number, but then you would scroll to your teacher notifications and you have the options to be notified of when a student submits something. So this is actually gonna be when a student submits anything. So it's not just any open ended or essay that require you to grade. We have put that as feedback to buzz, which is our learning management system we use um that holds the bright thinker content, but we've requested that, that be separated. So that's an option. But as of right now, this is just any time a student submits something. So now that um if a student submits an automatically graded assignment, you'll still be notified of that. Just keeping that in mind and then anytime a student's grade drops be passing or if a student's enrollment status changes. So with those three options, we highly recommend to either use email or if you specifically have T Mobile, then it's ok. But some of the other carriers, we've gotten feedback like cricket or I can't think of the other one. So via chime in if you can, but those actually notify you with separate text messages. So every single time that it's submitted, you'll get a new number, texting you. So your inbox will be full and it's just not the best sometimes. But with T Mobile, we've heard feedback and with emails, it'll all come as one text message. So uh for lack of better terms, it's one number that it comes from. So you get separate texts within one number, but you won't be bombarded with 500 different threads of texts. Um Outside of that, you also have the option to upload an image. So the students don't have this option in their avatar, you can click the plus button and choose a picture right from your profile, right from your device. So you can choose a personal picture of yourself or a picture of your dog, anything you wanna include, um, or you can choose an avatar just as the students do and then anytime you change anything in your settings, you'll wanna click save and refresh to allow those to take place. And then that'll bring you back to your main page in your main window. As a teacher in the top left hand corner, you'll have that needs grading tab, same exact from the one on the main page. You'll also have notes as a teacher very similar to the students. If you take notes in the lessons or anytime you see that notes icon, you can come back here for reference. Underneath. There is a communication that is where we were brought earlier with the announcements. It's the same page and then the calendar as a teacher also shows you anything that's due. Please keep in mind this will not be identical to the student unless your enrollment dates are identical in a continuous course. Meaning if a student isn't enrolled until August, but you have early access in July, your due dates will not line up with the students. It's gonna take your starting in date and line everything out then and again, that's only for a continuous course. So if you have a range course and you are set to set the due dates, then those will be identical to the students. Um But outside of that, everything is very similar, they are quick links, you can go to as a teacher and then you can switch between day, week and month back underneath the main page. You have a new tab that the students do not, which is the people tab. So this is going to show everyone enrolled in every single course that you have. So this will give a quick snapshot of everyone that you have access to as a student in the top right hand corner. The gear icon is where I recommend you go first. This will allow you to select what you view in the people tab. I like to turn everything on and then I click save and it's gonna give you quite a bit of options. So if you don't need everything in here, that's totally fine. You can click it off. Um But I just wanna show you all of the options that you have. So the first is the co I'm sorry. Could you, could you show me again how you got to that last screen? Yes. So I'll go back a couple of steps just in case anybody else is a little bit confused on how I got here in the main menu. In the top left hand corner, I navigated down to the people tab and then in the people tab all the way over to the right. The gear icon is how I selected what I wanted on in this page and then you click save and everything has been turned on here. So the first icon is the accommodations. Um So those ones we just spoke on earlier as far as um speech stream being turned on all the time limiting the number of questions per multiple choice um across the board for the students, all four of those are going to show the teacher right here. So I don't have any um accommodations as far as this user. So I'm actually gonna go in and turn an accommodation on really quick so we can see what that looks like. I'll turn them all on. Ok. So now that I have an accommodation set for this user as a teacher, I can click in the people tab and be able to see what those accommodations are. So accommodations for this student and then they have everything turned on and then they'll just give you notifications of those. Um And then Sophia did update me via lita since her microphone is not working, all epic courses are continuous. So I will continue the training with just speaking on continuous courses to not confuse you. So sorry about that before, but everything will be automatically paced out for the students. So based on their enrollment start and end date, everything will pay for them. So that is true. If you're given early access as a teacher and you don't have the exact enrollment dates as a student, it'll be a little bit different in the calendar just keeping that in mind. Um But next to the accommodations you can see the overall score the student has and let's say this right. Thinker student was enrolled in four different courses. They will actually populate four different times and the course that you're looking at will be listed right underneath their name. So for this specific course, this is their score and amount of time they spent there, I can see their understanding, interest and effort level. If they completed their heart, heart icon and the date it was changed and then scrolling over, I can see the progress and mastery. The online indicator is my personal favorite. This will show me any time a student is logged in at the exact same time as me. And then you also have the pace and performance indicated by a green yellow or red dot So this student's pace is on schedule, but their performance is currently failing in the courses. And then you can see any badges and anything that any badges they earned, anything today that they submitted any failed assignments or late as well and then the end date for this student. So this is the quickest way to come and see. The last date that the student has to submit is December 28th 2022 for this course and then back up in the left hand corner to the main menu underneath the people. Tab is our customer support link. So this is where you can come and click. This will bring you right to a new tab and this is where you can either provide feedback, report, an issue or a bug or submit a help ticket. Um So we actually also have access to your Epic quick start guide, which I'm gonna open really quickly, which has been beautifully updated by LITA. Um But everything in here is specific to Epic and bright thinker. So any questions that you may have, it can easily be found in here and you can click control, find and just type in anything that you need to find and it will update here for you. I'm not saying that we are not here to help you with any additional questions. It's just a quick guide to help you. Should you need it. And I'm sure Leah can provide that link if anybody doesn't have it. And then back in the main menu underneath the customer support tab, we're actually gonna skip over clipboard for today. It's a little bit more advanced. Um but I'm gonna click on the more reports option. So this will allow you to pull a PDF version of any of these reports. So we have a student daily activity of progress and a grade details. So I'll show you an example of what that looks like the student daily Activity report. It's gonna show you time stamps of everywhere. The student was logged into the platform and how long and then the grade details report will give you a quick overview of the course that the students in. So a course grade their progress and then all of the grades that they have earned thus far. And again, those can be found in your more reports. Tab lastly, you have access to that student resources identical to the students on their side. Should you need it? And then your any courses you're enrolled in will populate in the bottom left hand corner as well with a color co ordination. I'm gonna click back on the home icon and now we're gonna focus on the course card. So yours similar to the student, but you have extra access. So you'll still have a course card with the image coordinating to each course, the course title as well. And then you have the activities icon, your grade book, the reports for each course, which is different from the more reports tab. You also have the people tab from here, which is a more in depth look of the people tab. So the one from your main menu is gonna encompass all of the students. This one is just for this course and then you also have the editor. So I'm gonna click on the play button first is very similar to the student. This is where you come and you can use the pencil icon to edit the landing page. So you can put anything you want here, you can change this daily, weekly, monthly, leave it the entire year, whatever is best for you and then scrolling down, you'll be able to access the activities just as a student does. So for example, if you wanted to come in here and view this eighth grade language, arts activity, you can see it exactly as the students see it. But even further in the top right hand corner, you can see that you're viewing ads yourself if you click here and the first drop down is view ads. This allows you to select a specific student. So I know that my student has already completed it. I'm gonna select, ok. Now I can see the score, they see I can go down to their submission. I'm able to see exactly what they have submitted. I can see that they have a retake available to them and I can even view their grade details as well. So this is the quickest way you'll be able to confirm a few different things without having to log in with credentials of a student or ask them on their end. You'll be able to just see right from here. I'm gonna use the back arrow in the top left hand corner to be brought back to the main page. And then this is just where you'll come. If you wanna do anything in the course such as the students, I'm gonna use the main menu in the top left hand corner. And now that I have selected this specific course, you'll notice my menu changed again. So this is the sub menu just for this course, the same icons we saw on the course card on the main page. So I'm gonna click down to the grade book. There's a couple cool features in here in the top right hand corner, you have a gear similar to how you have in the people tab. This is where you can select what you'd like to see in your grade book so you can choose user name. The last time the students logged in minutes spent in the course accommodations, um any progress or enrollment status and then any footers that you want. So if there's missing or low scores, anything like that and then at the very bottom, you'll have a box titled tools. This will allow you to export to a different course. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course. It's not gonna show me any other courses, but you'll have a list of other courses with check boxes and you can export the same settings you just chose here to all of your other courses. So you don't have to click into the grade book settings for each of your courses and change all of the settings. It'll just across the board, change for you. And then anytime you make changes, you wanna click save here and everything will apply. So I see that same accommodations flag I saw in the people tab, you can click there and view what those accommodations that student has their score per activity. And then in the top right hand corner next to the gear icon, once to the right is your lightning bolt which enables quick editing. This allows you to click any cell in the grade book, whether it has already earned a score been provided by you or is blank and you can enter in a score right from here. So you type in the score and click enter, you also can enter in an X and that will automatically excuse the assignment. So when someone asked earlier, if you can excuse an assignment for one student, but not all of the everyone in the course, this will be the quickest way, especially if you only have a couple assignments that you're trying to excuse for the student. This will allow you to go in and excuse and then you'll wanna make sure to turn that lightning bolt off so that you can go back in and not be affecting the score. Should you not want to anymore? Next to the lightning bolt is a tool. Um A wrench icon when clicked on this will allow you to export your scores. Should you need them in a CS V file? So it's just an Excel spreadsheet. I'll go ahead and export it so we can see what it looks like. Should you need the scores externally? It'll just show you that quickly for you outside of here. I'm gonna click and back into the grade book. So this is where you can do a couple different things. If you click into any scores already earned, this will show you the same tab as the needs grading tab we saw earlier. So you can come and adjust grades as you had before. You can edit your templates and then you can view with the submission history and the score activity from here if it is something that was automatically graded, so I'll go into the quiz, you'll be able to see all the answers. So you had not provided a score for this. This is automatically graded. Um but you do have the ability to change the score. So should, for whatever reason you decide that this student should earn court points for the justice question. You can go in and adjust the points for that question. It'll automatically update the score and you will need to click submit if you wanna save that score and then you'll notice the updates already for you. Another really cool thing in the grade book is if you click on the actual title of each of the activities on the click on quiz two, this will bring me into the stats. So if I had multiple students, it would list them all here the last time they logged in their status and score. But if I click over to analytics on the top, right, then I can scroll and see how the students answered. So again, I only have one student in here. But this will give me class statistics, 100% of this class answered the question wrong. This is the correct answer and so on, you can see 100% answered correctly. So if I decide that the students were not fairly questioned on this quiz, and I want to remove the question from score, I can do that here. And that will automatically give scoring back to each of the students that got the answer incorrect. So then if I use the back arrow, we can see the student did get that question incorrect. So now their score went up even higher automatically without me having to do anything else. Does anyone have any questions in regards to the grade book, how to change anything, anything like that? Perfect. So I'm gonna click back on the main menu in the top left hand corner underneath the grade book is the reports tab. These are all per course and will pull as a CS V file. So none of these are gonna be the PDF that would be in the more reports on the main menu. Um but this will allow you to pull a, a report on the grade book or the student in regards to performance on all of their courses or just in specific courses. Um Should you need any reports externally and then back in the menu menu underneath the reports is again another people tab, but this one is unique to this course. So it's only going to show you the students enrolled in this course and you'll notice I don't have all the options again just because it's a completely different people tab. I would need to go into that gear icon in the top right hand corner and select what I'd like to see on this people tab. But in the main menu, the last option when in a course is the editor. So this is how you're gonna come and see a lot of different things for bright thinker in the bottom left hand corner, you'll see a carrot right here to expand the left panel right now. I'm just in a course for actually, I have a meeting. But let me go back out, I'm just in a demo. So I actually don't have any standards aligned, but I'm gonna go into an Oklahoma course. So you can see what that would look like. So let's just pull up fourth grade El A. So when you're in the editor, let's say this is your actual course. You'll use that expansion arrow and then all of the standards that align with fourth grade El A for Oklahoma will be right here. But then when you open each unit, you'll be able to see what is covered for activity. So thats gonna be how you view standards within the course itself again in the editor and then you just expand on the left hand side to view, but I'm gonna go back really quick to the Doma demo. And then within each course, when you want to view something in the activity list, you'll need to open that unit folder with the carrot button and then that's how you'll see those activities in order to view correct questions. There's two ways you can do that in writing, thinker. So with any activities that have automatic grading like this, 4th, 8th grade, El A, I'm gonna use that pencil icon all the way to the right. And that will allow me to access all of the details and I'll click over to the questions tab and these are all the correct answers. Another way to view the correct answers on the exit out of here is it will be listed right beneath it. So if it's an upload, that isn't unique to a student answer, it's not gonna have 100 different possibilities of an answer. For example, math, it'll just have one or two. depending on the content, you will have an answer key listed right below. You can see this in the activities page as well actually. Um But when you're in the editor, you will go all the way over to the right using that triple dots and click preview. And this will allow you to preview the correct answer sheet for that activity. So this is an example of an activity, the student would upload work. There's only one possible right answer. So you'll have that answer key. When grading, I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. So again, the two different ways is either if it's already automatically graded and it has the answers in the platform, you use that pencil icon to go to the questions tab or if it has the answer key right beneath it, you'll use the triple dots all the way over to the right and preview underneath there. So all the way over to the right, you have three different icons. The first is an eyeball. So this will automatically excuse that assignment for everyone enrolled in the course. So let's say you wanted to hide the entire unit, the unit is closed here. So then I could just click the eyeball. And when I spanned the unit, everything within the unit is going to be hidden from the students. If you uncheck that eyeball, everything is then revealed again. So the benefit of the eyeball is if half the students have worked in there and half have not, if you hide the activity, everything will be taken out of the grade book, the students will no longer be able to see it, they'll not be required to work. But if you reveal it at any point, then all of those scores are able to come back. So that's why we recommend using the eyeball instead of deleting because it's kind of a safety net for you. But then you can also hide just the lessons within here or you can hide just one quiz. Um But keeping in mind any of the eyeballs here will hide from everyone in the enrolled in the course. So all students then next to the eyeball icon is that pencil editor outside of the questions tab, this is where you can see the settings. So all the settings across the board have been set for Epic. Um These are not Epic settings, these are just my demo course settings. Um But the number of temps is already there for you. Everything across the board has been submits this activity. I know last year there were some issues. If you're a returning teacher that students weren't able to move forward, it was making you grade things, we've changed that across the board. So students should be able to submit and move forward regardless of the score they received regardless if there's anything to grade or not. Um And then the passing score has been set to 60 as well. So everything can be found in that pencil icon to the right of the eyeball and then all the way over to the right of there is the triple dots. This will allow you to preview the activity. You can also move up or down or to a different unit. Should you need to, you can duplicate the activity as well or you can copy it to your library. So when you click copy to my library on the right hand side. If this isn't already expanded, you'll have another Carrot here to expand and the icon all the way over to the right is my library and you'll notice that copied in right here. The benefit is that we'll stay with you as a user. So if you would want to use this in a different course, at any point in time, you'll always have that activity with you, especially if you customize it from scratch or you need a completely different activity, you can copy it to your library and then that allows you to click and drag anywhere you'd like to have it. Um I have a quick question. Um And I'm sure you, you probably already said this. So I apologize but um when you click the pencil and then you can edit those settings and you can edit like how many attempts and stuff. What um this is all standard. So like is our default gonna be that they'll have two attempts. Um So let me go in. It is going to be the default for you, but the ones that we were looking at were not already epic settings. These are though. So let me go in here. So actually for lessons, the students have unlimited attempts for epic. But yes, this is where you would go to see the default settings that were already set um And or change them. Should you need to? Ok. So we're giving students unlimited attempts on assignments on lessons category. Yes, on the lessons. Ok, thanks. Yep. And then um further in there with that epic quick start guide again, if you do not have access to it, I'm sure lita already put the link in the chat. Um But at the very bottom is where all the settings are. So if you wanted to come and, and I think these are already updated. Yes. So they said changing to 60% for the school year. Um But everything in here is the settings that have already been applied by default to your courses. So that's at the very bottom of the quick start guide. Ok. And where is the quick start guide? One more time? I'm gonna a bookmark it. That's OK. I actually don't have the link to provide but lita if you don't mind putting that in the chat, I think she already did. Yeah. So if you see the chat of the zoom that we're in. Lita provided it in there, I also included it on the epic one bright thinker channel. Perfect. Thank you Lida. OK. So let me exit back out of there. Um So that is how you can move things around from the far, right, the triple dots, you're able to move things around copper library. Again, we highly recommend delete, not deleting, not to know. Um But you can also click and drag. So let me open a full instructional unit so we can see um keeping in mind if I click and drag this qui quiz two to be before quiz one, everything is meant to be in sequential order for bright thinker. So everything in quiz two encompasses less than 45 and six or whatever was prior to it. So if I go down here less quiz three is in company encompassing 78 and nine. So if I move it before those, the students are gonna be quizzed on things they might not have ever seen. So just keep that in mind when you're moving things around and editing and adding in your own things. Um and then at the very bottom left hand corner, the add activity. So it's kind of hard to see. Um but it's the very last option on your syllabus, you can click add activity and then anything in the first 3rd and 4th quadrants. So the L shape at the bottom will be blank. So you can add in an assessment and activity file attachment, youtube video and it will not contain anything in regards to bright thinker. So that's how you can um customize your own activities, add in flash cards, a journal, anything you like here. But then in the top right hand corner where it says library, you will be able to access your master courses. So you'll click open on that file. It'll take a minute because it's actually opening every single course that bright thinker offers. So let's say you are teaching fourth grade science and you want to supplement some third grade science and you can open this uh course, you can open any of the units that you wanna view and you can even preview the lesson before adding it in. So you'll scroll through, make sure this is the lesson you wanna add in. Then you'll click add to cart. It's not gonna cost any money. It's just the titling system they used. You'll have to click the cart button in the top right hand corner and then you'll always wanna click link. The difference is that link will link it back to the master so that any updates we make, it'll still come through to yours. All of the images will come through and all of the video as well as well. Um And the way that you can ensure that it was actually linked in is you'll see that little link icon. So actually all of these have it because I linked them in versus if it was already in your course, it does not have that little link icon thing. Um But then that will come in and you can click and drag that wherever you should need it. And then let's say you already have a lesson to. You'll wanna click on the pencil icon and you can change the title and then it'll look as if it was always there for the student. The only thing indication that it has come from a different grade level is state specific courses. Oklahoma. Third grade history, it'll actually show that it says third grade history in the lesson itself. That's something that can't be changed. Um And then all of the K through two courses have little videos throughout and they actually have a title with the grade level in there. But other than that, the title of the actual lesson um within the lesson itself for third through fifth grade outside of Oklahoma, it's not going to tell them that this came from a lower grade level or a higher grade level, whatever you're going from, I'm gonna click back out of here. So that is pretty much everything within the editor syllabus section. But then you'll notice in the top there's a couple different tabs. So I'm gonna click over to weights. This is where you can view the category weights. So again, I'm gonna use actually a different course, for example, because mine's not a great one. Um But you'll be able to see how the course is waited. So you have lessons, quizzes, practice as a unit test and then you'll even be able to open those and see what is encompassing between those. So you can ensure that you know that that lesson is 25% of their overall grade versus this unit test is 50. Um These are not epic settings. These are my demo ones. Again, let me go and see what epics are. Oh, actually they are. Yep. Epic uses the same one. So it's 2525 0 50 for lessons, quizzes, practices and human tests. And then next to that, we have the activity list. So this is within the editor. Let me close. I'm actually gonna get out of here. So I don't actually change anything in our master. Um But in the activity list, this is where you can come and filter so you can type in quiz. Um You can type in lesson anything you want to change all at one time. Um And just keeping in mind that when you type in lesson, that's also gonna populate the answer key and things like that. So just be aware of what's populating on that list, but I'll do a quiz for an easy example and then you can check box the box at the very top right hand corner and that will check everything on for you. And then in the top right where that pencil icon is to bulk edit, that will allow you to do a couple different things in bulk. So if it's grayed out, that's not allowing you to do that in bulk, just because a specific there might be one or that whole activity type is not allowing you to do it in bulk for whatever reason. But if that check box lets you check it on, then this is how you can quickly do a couple different things in the platform. So who the activity is visible to that is the eyeball icon. So this is hiding, if you change to teachers only or teachers and observers, it will hide from all of the students. So it's automatically excusing for all of the students at one time, everything that you checked on, you can also change the location. So if you wanna put all of these quizzes to one folder and move everything at one time, you can do that. You can also change the passing score quickly from here. Again, it's set to 60 for epic. But if you want to, if there's a couple quizzes that were off and you wanna make sure they're all 60 you can do that here. Um assessment password. If you want to require the students to enter a password before they take the assessment. Again, this is going to encompass everything that you check on for. So it would be required to be across the board. And then you can also change the number of attempts for quiz. It's currently two, but you can put in custom and change the amount here as well. You'd wanna click the check box confirming that you understand it's permanent update and then that will automatically update all of the items that you checked on there for you. Um Also from this tab, you can preview, so using that triple dots, you'll, you're able to preview this assessment, should you want to before you edit it and then all the way over to the right is group settings. So this was a question that someone had in regards to how to hide maybe an entire unit from one student instead of everybody at the same time. So the lightning bolt in the grade book that we spoke on earlier is the quickest way to excuse one or a few activities from one student or a couple students. Um depending on what you're doing. But if you need to hide an entire unit or a couple units, that might be a little conti time consuming in the grade book. So you can create groupings um within the group settings, you would need to click the wrench icon in the top right hand corner and down to manage groupings and this will allow you to add a group. So for example, I'm just going to put start dates here. So I'm gonna have a few students that are starting at different dates and I might wanna hide some things from them. So the group creation method, I'm gonna do a fixed number of groups because I want there to specifically be two groups. But you can also do a target number of students per group. And then you can select how many students are in groups and that'll based off of how many groups there are. Um And then the group assignment I always select none because I want to choose which students go into which groups. But you can depending on which types of groups you're creating, select random round robin alphabetical the same or different by performance and, or um by the different quarters. Um top or bottom, things like that. So I'm gonna click generate with none. And so then it's automatically gonna give me an, a title right here in the top right hand corner where you have the edit groups with the pencil, you can change this title that it automatically gave you. So I'm gonna title this August, my students that are starting in August and then I'm actually gonna have some more students starting later. So I'll use this little people with the plus button to add a group and then again, I can edit that name and let's say these students start in September. Perfect. So I'm gonna put my student in one group. If for whatever reason, the type of groups that you're determining, you can check off this box and allow your student to be encompassed in both groups. Um But I just want one. So then I'll click save and you'll assign all your students to whichever group you need. And now I have my start date groups. So I'm gonna click the back arrow and then you'll notice you're choosing your grouping. So if you have multiple groups, you can select which one you're affecting right now and then where you're at and then view by either the property, the activity itself, which is the group or the groups will align on the right hand side. So I like to be in property. It's the least confusing for me personally. And then you can either you can change the visibility. So this is only for my students starting in August and this is only for my students starting in September and which groups I put them in. So now I can go in and I'm actually only in the core content, but I'll go back up to the full course. I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in September or I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in August. That way you can hide multiple units, multiple activities from specific groups of students and you don't have to do it from your main page, hiding it from everyone. And I know we went through that rather quickly. We do have a PDF walking through every step and what everything means. And of course, if you have any questions and there's interest in the need of an advanced workshop, we can always do that as well. But I'm gonna go back to my questions tab that you all had um on questions that you asked. And then Sophia, if there's anything in the chat that's not in here, please let me know. Um I, I have a quick question on the groups. Is that something that you said we'll talk more about in the advanced class? Yes. OK. And we have a PDF as well. That kind of gives like a description in depth of every option that you can select. And also this year we're gonna talk about um during office hours uh at the beginning of the year, Megan and Sophia have agreed to join us the first week um on one of the days. So if you have questions or as you guys are getting into it with students and have questions, you can join us as well. But then also um throughout the year, we're going to have specific skills that kind of go along with that time of year uh that we will highlight and um do a video tutorials on as well during office hours. Yes. And the benefit of office hours that we've done in the past is it gives us the opportunity that we only um have one teacher in the, we have the ability to only have one teacher in the zoom meeting at one time and we don't record those. So that way if you have a specific question and you need to share your screen with student data, something's going on with your specific student, we can walk through that and look at your screen together um outside of a group setting where we can't share student data. OK. So I'll just start from the top. One of the questions that was asked is how can we edit calendar pacing for the to do list but not affect the course and date to prevent the course from expiring. Um So the only way to edit the to do list is if you're in a range course mode and that allows you to edit all end dates. But the difference with that is it doesn't give um pacing for the students. And so all of the courses for Epic right now are currently in continuous. So you would not be able to edit those to do estate um outside of changing their enrollment and dates, which is I know was a part of the question said not to. So, but if you do change the enrollment starter and date, that will obviously change the pacing for the student, um I might need a little bit clarification on the next question, but I will go off what I think you're asking and then if you're in the zoom call, let go ahead and let me know if I'm incorrect. But the next question is, can parents slash students change from their app if they want to work ahead? So Epic actually doesn't um for lack of better terms, gate students. So you can work as far ahead as you want and they actually don't even have to work in sequential order. So the students are able to work wherever whenever, as far ahead as they want. That was from a question who from someone who said she wasn't able to make it. Ok. Hopefully you are watching the video back and then if you have another question um or I didn't answer that correctly, please just let Lita or myself know and we can further discuss that. And then the next question was where can I hide things from student view? We covered that in the course editor with the eyeball icon. Even further, you can also hide things from students using the lightning bolt in the grade book with the X and enter and that will excuse it from a specific student. Um How can I change the number of attempts on quizzes, practices or exams? Um That's what we covered earlier, either by the pencil icon in the settings or in that activity list of the editor where you can do multiple things at one time and then same thing with the past threshold, it's gonna be in those settings or in the bulk editing feature. Will the K through two have social studies and science? Um We do provide social studies and science on the bright thinker side from K through two. It might just be that lita and the team are working on them. So you might not see them in the demo just yet, but we do offer them. Um And then can you show us how students take notes? We did cover that in the student side. But if you are still confused on that or have a question, please let me know is there a specific writing course for fourth through eighth to match PS grade books? Lita you might need to help me with that one. I'm not sure what a PS grade book is. The PS is Power School. Um, got it. Yeah, we're doing the, the talking back and forth between, uh, bright thinker and power school to automatically load the grades. So they have to have the same settings and the same forces. Got it. Ok. But I think four through eight we just have English. Correct. Yes. Mhm. As far as what brand thinker offers? Yes. And then is there a general supply list? And that was already answered, they will be shared on the bright thinker channel of epic one. I did wanna mention some of the supply lists as far as we know what you have access to might not be updated just because they have updated all of those courses as of this year. Um So if you're a teacher looking for a supply list, let me go back into the platform at the top of I closed it out. Let me go back in really quick. At the top of any of your courses, you have the ability to view the supply list, the teacher guides, anything like that. So for a K through two course, when you're in the activities, you'll have course resources as a teacher, this one has a pacing guide and then underneath each unit will have the teacher guide and a unit workbook for the students to be able to print everything they need. Should they need it. But in that teacher guide for K through two is where you can find the supply list in here. Um If they have any that's needed and then they also give you supplemental material. Should you wanna add anything outside of what is already covered? And then for those older grade levels, I'll pull up an example. We'll go to fre map. I don't think that fifth grade math will have a supply list, but anything that is needed at the top will be in a PDF for you. Um So this is gonna let you know the course manipulatives needed um throughout the course. And then I know for like some of those higher level courses like biology, they also have course resources at the top. So um teacher guidelines with, with or without the lab manual and then if there's any principles, those will also be within the unit as well. So right within the course, it'll hold that supply list or anything that the students need. Um So we recommend definitely going into the course itself once you have access to them to ensure that's everything that's updated for your specific courses. Um But we are working to update those supply list that you have access to Rita. Ok. And I have access to those courses, so I should be able to pull those. Correct. Absolutely. Mhm. Ok. Um And then one other thing too is last year Lindsay went in and found the, um, the novels that are required for each of the, the uh classes and she put together a tablet that has access to those novels as well. How wonderful. That is awesome. Um, the, yes, the required reading list. I think you have access to this one later, but this will list out everything that's externally required as far as a novel in each grade level and where it's used in each unit as well. Um Let me see where we left off. Is there an upload limit? So I took note of that. I don't believe that there is especially not what the students would be uploading. Um But again, I'll check with Buzz RL MS just to make sure um lita before our advanced workshop, if you have time, let's schedule a time so that we can discuss the admin level permissions that teachers have. Um Just because no one is currently enrolled in courses. So I wasn't able to see that and I didn't want to misanswer anything. Ok. Ok. Awesome. The next question was about how many activities per subject can students expect a week? So again, that's gonna be dependent on their start and end date. As far as the continuous course, it'll automatically pace everything out for them. But if there is a pacing guide at the top of the course for K through two or externally for these other courses, that'll help you just get an idea of what's due and how much is due and then how can the teacher see what standards are covered that's gonna be in that editor. But of course, if you have any questions on how to get back there, let me know and I'll show that again. Sophia, was there any questions in the chat that were not covered in the spreadsheet or what we just discussed? No, I believe you covered it all. Ok. Awesome. Did anybody else have any remaining questions? I have. Oh, go ahead. Ok, real quick. Um, I just added a question. I don't even know if you can see it yet, but are we able to get a copy of that required reading list? Like the books that are required? Yeah. Um, lita, I will send an email over to you and then however you want to make that available. I'll let that be up to Epic. Ok. Thanks. And thank you. Of course. I think someone else had a question at the same time. It, was that the same one or do you have a different one? Uh, yeah, I just kind of maybe wanted your input or some, maybe some other, uh, if there's any other special education, uh, Epic teachers. I've got kind of mixed reviews from teachers who have used. Right. Thinker in the past. Um, some of them are like, it's overwhelming that the additional, uh, like supplies and stuff that they'll need, you know, offline in the curriculum and then some people, um, are like, no, it's usually just like basic stuff that's laying around the house, like for science experiments or for other projects and different subjects. Um I'm primarily gonna be using this for my K through eighth grade uh classes. So, um, did you have any, any thoughts on that? I do. Yes, I do. So, we have gotten that feedback from a lot outside of just epic. And this year was one of the major changes that the curriculum team has gone in and updated the courses and I know they're just gonna continue to be updating them. Um But they have gone in and made more accessible um labs. So let me go in here and show you Sophia. Do you remember the specific courses that they made changes to? I don't have the list on hand. I don't. Exactly, but I can check on my side also. Ok, let me see if I can find an example. Let's talk about them. Ok. So they've gone in, I think it was the higher grade levels in eighth grade, which is not helping you specifically. I'm sorry about that. But I, they might have changed eighth grade as well. Um But I know that they're going in and they're making more virtual labs, more things accessible to students that are um at home, not using the labs specifically in a classroom. Um But if you still see any remaining labs, you are more than welcome to hide them and if you have other labs that you'd like to use, please feel free to do that. But I know that the curriculum team is going in and they're updating some of those so that they are more accessible because there are a few that require things like um a balance beam that students might not have access to or a microscope and different things like that. So, ok, that was my kind of my follow up thought there was maybe to just omit it if it was too complicated and that won't have too big of an impact on. I mean, it'll have an impact but not too big of an impact on their grade or. Well, I guess if you admit it, it won't have any impact on their grade but correct, but it wouldn't be hindering them from learning anything for like a specific quiz or la um test or anything like that. All the labs are separate. So the quizzes will just cover the lessons themselves and then the practice and unit test will cover the quizzes and um lessons. OK. Good, good to know. And it's really easy to going through the editor to add a dry lab too if you wanted to. Um So if you have like a video like on youtube, that maybe corresponds to what the lab was, you can upload that with some questions that they can then do in lieu of the lab that's listed there. OK. Good idea. In that advanced workshop, we'll be covering more in depth on the different types of activities. You can create how to do those groupings, more in depth, how everything applies to each other. So in the meantime, from this um meeting to the next, if you have any questions for LITA or you're like, I really wanna learn more advanced on this. Please let us know and we'll make sure to cover that in the next training and we'll keep the spreadsheet open. So if you uh go away and come back with some more questions, you can update that spreadsheet and we'll definitely keep looking at that for uh the next training as well. Awesome. I just wanted to give a couple of seconds to make sure nobody had any other questions, but it seems like they've all been answered. So me and Lida will meet together before our next meeting and make sure that I'm aware of all of the settings that you'll have access to as far as um in regards to your administrative training or your administrative application so that I can fully answer all your questions. We'll go in more in depth as far as um the different types of activities you can create in epic specifics. And then as long as everybody has access to that epic quick start guide, I think that will be very beneficial to you. All the required reading actually might be right within that quickstart guide if I remember correctly but um I will send that in an email to LITA and then she will inform you on where that is available. But thank you for all your time today. It has been a pleasure and yes, le to put in the chat. The next meeting is Wednesday, August 10th and I have one, just one note about that August 10th. I believe that is a professional development epic professional development day. Ok. Does that mean you all have a lot of other trainings that day as well? Yeah, we have to travel to Oklahoma City that day, but the way they do it now, I think it's just by teams. I'm not sure if it's everyone. Uh Luta, do you know, will we just watch the recording if, if that's the case? Yes, I'll definitely make sure everything's recorded and available and if you wanted to, if you've got questions that you want us to cover and you're not able to go, you can always add up to that spreadsheet and we'll make sure that we cover it in, in the course as well. Ok. Awesome. Thank you for the input. I had no idea. So, yes, the next meeting would be August 10th at 1 p.m. If you're welcome. If you're able to join, we would love to have you. But of course, if not, we'll report it again and make sure you get that. That is all I have to share for you today. Lida. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? Um No, I just thank you guys for joining us and having these great questions and conversations. It's definitely we wanna make sure it's tailored for what you guys need. So awesome. Thank you so much.\"), (1869, 495, 3431, \"Have on Epic. So Lita started the recording. I'm just gonna reexplain for those that are not here today. And my name is Megan. I'm a part of bright thinkers, professional development team. We're gonna be walking through the student's application as far as what they can submit, what they're able to see on their side, all of the different features within Epic. And then we'll also look at a teacher's end and everything that you have a accessible through Epic, you all have a specific role. And so especially if you are a returning teacher and you notice something or you have a question about something, please don't hesitate to take your microphone off or throw something in the chat and just let us know specific Epic things. Um And then of course, if you have any questions that are regarding Epic specific leader will be throughout the chat as well. Um So Lena mentioned that y'all have a spreadsheet that was shared with us, which is questions for bright thinker. Um And it looks like yes, I'm still sharing my screen so you're able to see it. And these are just a few of the questions that came in. So we're actually gonna walk through the demo first because it's just basics of what it looks like and then we'll come back to the questions. So if you have any, please throw those in the chat or for Sophia or Lita and then you can also add to that spreadsheet and I should get updates. Um, but if not, if you don't see your question updated, just let me know at the end. All righty. So this is what it looks like for anyone in bright thinker when they click log in. Um As a teacher, you might see a couple different permission sets, you should as an epic teacher have the option as an administrator or a teacher. Mine says student because I'm enrolled as a student. Um So we're gonna start on that side when you're in the course. I'm actually gonna change my color really quick. I like it at blue. It's less distracting for me. Um But I know y'all's color is orange. So when we start as a student logging into the platform in the top left hand corner, it will highlight that the student is on their courses tab, they also have the option to click over to the to do list and this will show them anything past due at the beginning and then the next seven calendar days due from there. And I just wanted to remind as well as we're walking through here. Please do not hesitate to take off your microphone or talk in the chat and ask any questions as we're moving along in the platform. So these are all quick links for those students. They can click right into here and actually access that lesson. You'll notice that it's not showing the lesson for the student just because there's an activity due before this one and this one is just the getting started video. So we'll talk a little bit more into that in depth, but I'm gonna stay on the to do list for now. So these are all quick links. The student can work right from here. It will tell them the due date and most of the courses in epic are continuous courses, which means that the course will automatically pace out for the students giving them targeted due dates. So they're not hard set dates. These are just going to pace out depending when the student needs to end the course. By the last thing on the top, on these tabs that the student can click on is their activity stream. This is going to be a notification center for the students. So this is where they can come to see any feedback left by a teacher. If they have a new score updated, anything the student would need to be notified of as well. You can see click click links here. So any time you see a blue hyperlink as a student, you can click right in there and it'll either give you the feedback for the new score you earned. And then if I were to click on one of these titles that would bring me right into that lesson or quiz, I'm gonna click back over to my courses tab on the left hand side in order to navigate back to my courses. So this is exactly what it looks like, right? When they logged in, they'll always see the updated day and then the announcements to the right. So anytime a administrator at the top level, meaning lita or someone with an epic at a higher level has posted an announcement for everybody to see teachers and students. Or if you have as a teacher have posted an announcement, the student will be notified here and they'll be able to click and be able to see that announcement. It will notify them of who this came from. So my name in the site is Bright Thinker, but this would say the teacher's name who it was given to. So this is the course and then the date it was created and when it expires, you'll notice it automatically brought the student to the communication tab. This is something they can find in their hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. I'm gonna click back. We'll notice that it brought us right down to communication. I'm gonna click back into the home icon and how I got there was that announcements right from the home page. So speaking of that hamburger menu. We're actually gonna walk through there first. So I'm gonna click back up there in the top left hand corner and the first option down from the home icon is the grades for the student. So this is gonna be their overall grades. If they're enrolled in four courses, all four will populate here. They have that quick link to their course. They also have a heart icon. This allows the students to click and drag their understanding interest and effort levels to update their teacher on how they're feeling. And of course, there's four options within each bar and they can come in here and update this as much as they'd like. It will also list any teachers enrolled in the course and then they have two different progress bars when hovered over, it'll tell them the total number in each progress. This one has 43 on the right and this one has 37. The first one is just gradable activities. So anything included in the students final score, the other one is going to include any non gradable activities as well such as coloring pages, objectives, like getting started video, something that the student wouldn't require a grade for, but it's still an active activity they must mark as complete in order to finish the course. They can also view on the top left hand corner where it's highlighted as courses, any of their past courses. So I've been enrolled in quite a bit of past courses, but this is where I can come and see any scores. I previously earned my current status in that course. And then the progress and the time that I spent there, I click back over to the courses tab where the student would be and anytime they see this print icon, they have the ability to print this out. So it'll just give them that summary of the page that they're on. I'm gonna go back in the main menu and underneath here is the notes tab. So this is where students will hold such as a digital notebook. And any time they're in the lesson, they have an ability to take a permanent note where they can take notes on any of the content. They're learning to remind themselves of anything such as if they had a physical notebook in a in person class, just gives them the ability to come back here and have access to anything. They took notes while learning a lesson back in that main menu underneath the notes tab is the communication that's where we were brought earlier from the announcements notification. They can click through and see any announcements that has been posted by a teacher and or admin back in that main menu underneath the communication is gonna be the calendar again with those continuous courses, it will pace out for the student so they can come here and click anywhere they see the color coordinate dot with each course, anything due for that course, any blackout dates will also populate for the student and it will notify them that nothing is due on those days. So that's gonna be any holidays assessed by your administrators and already input into the main domain for you. But when the student is enrolled in multiple courses, they'll have different courses listed beneath with all of the different color dots for them. And these are also quick links. So if the student wanted to work right from their calendar, they could click right in here and begin working for the day. I'm gonna click back in the top left hand corner and down to student resources. This is the last option that a student has in their main menu. It's all of the frequently asked questions by students in the platform, especially if they're brand new to bright thinker all via video. But then at the very bottom, we also have a PDF option depending on the student's preference. Teachers and administrators also have this tab in their main menu. Should you need it? Um Just so you can help direct the students if they get a little lost in the platform. Lastly, underneath all of the main options, we then have a dark gray bar and all of the courses that the students enrolled in so that they can click right from here and begin working in their course. Should they want to from the main menu? I'm gonna use that home icon. And then that way we can look at what a course card is. So we call this rectangle of course card. It includes an image to coordinate with the course that the students enrolled in as well as the course title. And then these dates right here are gonna show unique to the student. The first and last day they can submit work in the course. Once they actually begin working, they'll have a current score populate here. And then the progress bar will actually also darken as they move along in the course. And then at the very bottom, we have a play button that will bring them right into the activities or the bar graph icon will bring them to their grades specific to this course. So we're gonna click on that play button and then the student will automatically see a few things here. So all of those same course details from the main page, but then to the right, they will be able to see their score right here once it populates, I haven't begun working. So I don't have one yet. The great icon again here. And then the eyeball feature allows the student to click and hide their score. So if they had a score previously right here, it'll just disappear as there's nothing there. It's not gonna change their grade in any way. It's actually just going to hide it from them if they're discouraged in any way or they just don't want to see their sport at this time. And then underneath they, they have a more in depth progress. So they're able to see by percentage and one hovered over the exact amount out of total that they have completed as far as activities in this course underneath, there is going to be the welcome page or the landing page. This is specific to each teacher. So once we switch over to the teacher, we'll show you how you can customize this. It's utilized in many different ways across the board. You can use this as a static announcement. You can include a Zoom link, any youtube videos, any text and images that you'd like to make unique to your course, just what you whatever you'd like the students to see as soon as they log into their course and then scrolling down, the student will then see the full entire course, all one through 10 units. If it's a core course under that activities page to the right. They have another quick snapshot of their to do list just for this course. And then they also have course links. These are all unique to this course as well. They can be included by the teacher as extra resources or anything you should want to show the student. When clicked on, it's just going to populate a new tab. We used our bright thinker site as an example. But again, you can use this for extra resources for math, reading anything you'd like, I'm gonna click back over to the activities and then the student can either start at the up next activity at the very top or they can open a unit folder and begin working at the first activity there. The getting started video is going to be in all of the courses for the student. It's just a quick walk through of the platform in case the student has never been a bright thinker before, they would click mark this activity as complete in the bottom left hand corner and then they would be able to move to the next activity by scrolling to the right hand side. Once here, this is actually going to show the next unit uh just a quick preview of what's coming up because we haven't yet begun working in this unit folder. So I'll click on that first activity. And in here, we've actually up included an upload example for fourth grade science. So this is a science journal activity requesting that the student create a cover page for their science journal and then a table of contents and all of the safety rules encompassing here. So as a student after I have finished my work, I have a couple different ways that I can upload in the platform. You can either click right into this text box and it will populate a ton of different options for the students. One being this picture icon that allows you to insert an image right from your device. So you can either click and drag an image right here. You can upload by URL or using this um camera icon. You can capture right from your device. If you have a webcam applicable, then the student also has the option to insert a video or audio. They can text right within the box, oops or they can use the plus button in the big blue circle in the bottom right hand corner allowing them to attach a file right from their device. So there's many different ways that the students can upload work. I'm gonna use your course list as an example and then I'll upload there. Once the student has uploaded, they can confirm before submitting their work that this is what they intended to upload. If they are not trying to submit this for their work, they clicked on the wrong activity, they can simply remove before they submit and select the correct image instead. But I like what I have. So I'm going to submit my work and then a few things will change for the student here. It's going to notify them. They have successfully submitted the assignment and the button now changes to resubmit my work into instead of submit. So is there a limit for the size of the file that they can upload? Um We, I would have to actually look into that. Lita let me take a note of that. We haven't run into any issues where students have tried to upload it too big of a file. Um I'm sure there is a limit but it's probably greater than anything a student would try to be submitting. That's a great question though. I'm gonna follow up on that just in case. All right. So that's how a student would submit work. And then if you scroll back just a little bit to the top, you can now see that the status has changed to completed slash submitted. And they'll see this little paper icon. Anytime a student sees this paper icon also in the top right hand corner in the platform, that means that there's either a portion of the activity or the entire activity requires something to be graded by the teacher. So they do not have the full grade yet. It's not an automatic submission by the platform. So they're waiting on a grade in here in order to move to the next activity, they can either use the toggle arrows in the top left hand corner or scroll to the bottom and use the next activity button in the bottom right hand corner from here. This is an example from first grade social studies. So it's gonna look a little bit different than those older grade levels for K through two, if we have any K through two teachers in here. Um This is just going to show you an overview how the difference the students have in that they'll learn just a little bit of the content and then answer those questions here instead of on the older grade levels, it's actually going to all encompass on one page and all of the content will be at the top and then they'll scroll to the bottom and review section in the bottom. So this was intended hopefully to hold that focus of the students as they're learning and cause less distractions instead of having it all on one page. And you will notice this is a good thing to take note of. Um these videos are not required to be watched. So if I was a student and I got to this last page and I decided I don't want to watch the video, I can click next um that they are able to watch that video if they would like none of the videos in Bright Finger are going to exceed three minutes. That is because they're intended to assist with learning but not teach the lessons themselves. So I'm gonna click next. Once the student hits this review page, they will see a check mark in the bottom right hand corner of each question, ensuring they have answered all of the questions, I'll click submit in the bottom right hand corner and then it'll give the student one last chance. So just make sure they don't wanna go back and check any questions before submitting, but I'm ok. So I'm gonna submit and then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, I automatically have earned a grade for this. That is because there was nothing open ended or essay, nothing to upload. So the teachers are not required to provide a grade before the student sees their answers or I'm sorry before they see their score. So if the student either can click jump to submission up here in the top left hand corner or they can scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll just bring them down here. There is a section called view grade details and this is where the student is able to see a quick snapshot of everything entitled in their course. So their score, the status is now completed, the targeted due date versus the date they submitted as well as the active amount of time they worked on that lesson before clicking submit. They can also then click over to the questions tab and the lower grade level students will have to click through in order to see their questions per number. Um But this is where they can come and see what they answered and the question score and you'll notice that this is actually exactly what an epic student sees um because I have changed all the settings to match. And so the student will see their answer and the score after the first submission, I'm gonna go back. They also have a submission history. It's just a quick snapshot for the student to be able to see if they submit again, then they'll see the second version here with the unique details of that second submission. So I'm gonna go back really quick since it's a first grade and resubmit my work so that you can see what happens after the second attempt. Um The students will always have this retake button available that to them for anything encompassing in the lessons category, which means lessons, activities, practice not included in the practice test, project skills and they have an unlimited number of attempts with epic. So they can click retake here in the bottom right hand corner and the activity will look as if this unit had never submitted. So they would go back through, provide a new answer or the same answer depending on their first round. And then oops, I missed a couple there. I think I skipped over number three. Yeah. All righty. And then once I click submit here, my new score will pop in the top right hand corner. So when I go down to my submission area and my view my grade details in the submission history, I can now see the 1st and 2nd version and the scores I earned the 1st and 2nd time. I'm gonna click back on the X air in the X in the top left hand corner. And then I'm gonna talk all to the next activity from here as the students are working in the platform. They also will have a couple different options to help assist as they're learning. So in the top right hand corner, you'll notice in the toolbar, we have a highlighter is the first option. Now, depending on which device you're on, it will allow you to either just drag over and that will highlight some devices require you to drag and click enter. Um So just be aware of that as students are working in the platform, the highlighter can be utilized in the content itself or in the review section. So this is a great example of how K through two is a little bit different than those older grade levels. This one came from an eighth grade course. So you'll notice how everything is on one page with the vocabulary at the top, the content itself and then the review section at the very bottom, they also have an eliminator to the right of the highlighter. This is going to give that visual process of elimination on multiple choice questions. So when hovering over, they'll see that little X and this will allow the student to visually cross out any answers, they are sure are wrong. The student accidentally clicks on one of the correct answers. No big deal at all. They can either just click that right back off or if they select that answer choice, it will take it off for them to the right of the answer eliminated. They will have the print feature. This is printing prior to submission. So they will be able to work on paper should they need to. Um but they would still be required to go back in and answer digitally on the platform to the right of the print feature. Then we have text to speech which will open up a full panel of options. So I'll go to the top so we can look at a couple of these options. You have the pointer finger which will allow the student to select where they would like the platform to begin reading. An assumption is a statement that is accepted. They also have the play button that will read from the very top of the um lesson itself and read up to 1000 words. They would then need to use the point your finger to continue. Should it exceed past those 1000 words past that we have the stop and pause button and then the translator. So this can do anything from a sentence to a word to a phrase to a paragraph. Um I'll just do one word here and then we can click the translator button up in the top right hand corner and this will translate the word for them. It looks like it's clicking on the wrong one. Let me try that again. So now let me check my settings really quick. Sorry about that. So mine's translating from English to Spanish. Let me try a fool. Freeze here. There we go. So it's gonna translate to the language specified in the settings which we'll get into in just a minute and it will read out for up to 18 of the most common languages. Some of them will only translate the text itself. I next to the translator is going to be a dictionary. So it will give a definition of a word or phrase highlighted. We then also have a picture icon to go along with all of the words in the platform. Next to that will be the screen mask, which is one of my personal favorites. This will allow the student to focus as they're reading through the platform. I used to do this with a bookmark on actual textbook. So it's nice to see this in a digital platform as well. And then last but not least we have the magnifier which coordinates with the pointer icon and will magnify the words as it reads to the students. Emotional appeals often use loaded language or last icon next to that is actually a highlighter. So very similar to the one that we have within the platform already. But this will actually give a couple different colors which is very useful in English or some of those higher level grade levels that need to annotate or use different colors. Um So you can just highlight over where you need to and click the color you'd like to use and then you'll notice the gear icon. This will allow you in the general settings to change the voice speed, the text highlighter color, the magnifier size as well as the speech mode. And then we have the translation button. This is where you can select which language it's translating from English to another language. And you'll notice this little um microphone or loud icon that just lets you know that it's actually going to speak that language to the student. Otherwise it will only translate the text to them. Then we also have screen tools. So if you'd like to change the reading light color, so this is just specifically for the reading mask, so I'll change it just so we can see what it looks like. And the student actually is able to open that screen mask and then change what it looks like. So they can decide actually that's not what I actually wanted there. Um And then they can do anything to their preference here and then should they not like anything, they can reset it back to the default. And we do have a PDF explaining everything that I just went through in detail. Should you need to share that with a student or go back and research your steps as you're walking through it on your own, any time you see the paper, airplane icon that's going to be communication form for the student. So as long as the teacher and the student both have an email within the platform, they will be able to send a message to this, the teacher keeping in mind this is going to go to every teacher enrolled in the platform. Um but they can ask a question right from here and it will send straight to the teacher's inbox of whatever email is specified in their profile last. But not least we have that notes icon, sticky note at the very top. Anytime you see it in the student tools that's gonna be a permanent note and it allows the student to take a note and it will save in that digital um notebook that we saw earlier in the notes tab of the main menu. So they can um either copy and paste into the platform of the notes or they can type right within here and then it'll time stamp it for them, tell them where it came from and then they can click right to their notes from here as well if they'd like to. But I'm gonna click through the questions at the bottom. Um Just so we can move on to the next activity and you can see what this looks like. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to take off your microphone or throw them in the chat. And Sophia will either answer them or let us know and we can talk through them as well. Can you delete um activities or lessons if you needed to? Absolutely. Sorry. Go ahead to modify for a student. Yes, absolutely. So we can go in a little bit in depth of it, specifically what Epic prefers as well. But once we get to the teacher's side, I'll show you the editor and you have freedom to hide activities. And so that will essentially excuse for all of the students that'll take it out of their preview. The only reason we recommend to not delete is just because especially if students had already begun working in the platform and it will delete all of the scores they previously earned. But that's a great question. All righty. So you all will notice um we had a few automatic grading options at the top of the activity. But then we also have some open end questions. We just wanted to put this in here so we can show you what it would look like for a student. So they will see that same icon indicating that something needs to be graded by a teacher and they will not be able to see a score until that is given by the teacher, but they can still see the review section. So everything they provided an answer for and then the text box at the very bottom um for the ones that had the and now last year lita I don't know if it's just on my side. I know you were asking a question but you were cutting out quite a bit. So I wasn't able to hear what it was. Yeah, there, there's some classes that have the guided notes, I can remember what they're called. Are they available this year or is that not till next year? Yes. So the accommodated courses are what you're referring to. I believe those are actually only going to have a reduced number of questions per ques quizzes practices and unit test. So they are available. Um Those are completely separate courses that would need to be added in. Um but they will be containing five questions across all quizzes and then 10 questions a across all practice and unit tests. Thank you, of course. All right. So at the sa the bottom, all those same options are gonna be here in order to view the grade details, see the targeted duty and when it was submitted and then they have that retake button available to them. I'm gonna click the next activity from here and this is actually going to be an example for once we get over to the teacher side. So I'm actually gonna skip this lesson and move on. I messed up. I forgot to allow myself to move on. So let me go ahead and submit this really quick and then I will be able to show you a quiz. All righty. So Epic does only allow two attempts per quiz for students. So it doesn't mean that the student can never take it past the two attempts. This is just prior to teacher intervention. So as a teacher, you'll always be able to go in and allow additional retries past those two attempts. But this is what the student will automatically receive. So when they click start, they will need to submit um require an answer per question and they will have to submit all at once. They don't have the ability to answer this question, leave and come back. Anytime a student leaves the assessment, they get kicked out via internet or issues or anything else that happens, the platform will. So let's say the student only answered this first question, the platform will submit for them, but it will never submit an answer for them. So it'll just all be marked blank. So they'll see the blank in the review section and then there'll be a um everything will be answered or marked as incorrect as far as the blank answers. So you'll be able to confirm, ok, there was probably an internet issue or they backed out of the quiz before they were done. The platform will never select an answer for the student. So I'll quickly go through and click so that you all can see the difference of what a student can see for the first admission versus the second. Um But as we'd asked earlier, there is something that we call an accommodated course offering this year. So it's brand new. Um And with those, all of the quizzes will only have five questions versus how you see here. This quiz has. I believe it's about 20 yeah, 20 questions So we're gonna click next. All of those are available. So I'm gonna click submit. So after I submit, there's no questions to display here. Um I got a 50% automatically and then I can view my grade details from here. I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. And then now everything that I have provided a submission for, I can see that green check mark indicating I've completed that activity, close that out and then this is just a full instructional unit so that you could see what it would look like outside of our examples. So this is third grade science unit two. It's gonna have about three lessons until it hits that first quiz. All of the activities, labs following pages will be sp sprinkled throughout the unit itself and then at the very bottom, they'll have a practice test and new unit test before they reach that next unit. Very similar. This is English one. Obviously, the grades are drastically different. Um But the flow of the course is about the same. So I'm gonna click back on my main menu in the top left hand corner. Now that I'm in a course, I have a different sub menu you'll notice. So I can click into my activities or grades from here because I'm already in this specific course. So the grades for each course, this is where a student can come see their overall score. There are different percentages for progress. And then if they scroll down to the bottom, they'll be able to see each line item submitted versus targeted due due date, the status and the score here. They also in the top left hand corner, have a dashboard, they can click on and then I'll just give a quick overview as well as the activity, which is a almost the far right, but about the middle and this will show the student exactly how long when they started working in each activity and then the total amount of time spent in this course, click back on that grades and then the main menu in the top left hand corner, they can either use these toggles, um icons in the top to navigate back to that regular menu or they can use that arrow to be able to see everything from here. So now that I took notes in that course, they populate here for me and I can actually click right back into the course I was working on. We use that main menu to go back to the student application. And then the last thing I'd like to show you on the student side is in the top right hand corner. The student's name will populate here again. Mine is just right thinker in the platform, they can click and get a couple of different options from here. Choose theme is gonna be the second one. This is where they can come and change their color theme. Now, of course, this can change at any time throughout the school year. If administrators at the top level of the domain decide they don't want students to do this, there's a couple of things they can turn on and off. Um But lady can correct me if I'm wrong. I believe the students currently have the ability to change the color and they also can choose their color scheme, meaning if they use the drop down option, they can change to a dark color scheme. So I'll do an obvious different color, like green and then the color will change everything such as their banners, their menu, anything that coordinates and then the dark color scheme have now changed everything that was once a light gray or a white color to a darker color. Um So this helps a lot with students that have headaches or issues with being on a computer for a long extended amount of time. Um But they definitely don't have to turn that on if they don't want to Megan walls just to show them how they share the calendar with their parents lito you're cutting out again for me how they view the calendar for their parents. Is that what you said? Well, I know that last year, the calendar Google calendar so their parents can see when things are due. Understood. Yes. So the students actually have the ability to go to their calendar. So I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner again down to the calendar icon and they will see these arrows in a circle and this allows them to sync and it will give them information on how to sync with their Google calendar. So it'll give all the due dates straight to their Google calendar. The only thing is they will not be able to click right from their Google calendar into the lesson. It doesn't um flow quite that well yet. Um But it will just show up the due dates in their Google calendar. So they're able to see it in both places. Um Teacher, I knew that this was really helpful. This would have been really helpful for my parents. I don't know what's due. I don't know when we was everybody able to hear lita on that one. No, I think you're sounds cutting out for everybody lita, but I was about to, I was able to piece it together. I think she was just intending that this is very useful for the students with Epic and the parents being able to see that calendar that the stu I guess, do the parents have access on their side to see their Google calendar maybe. And so it's a lot easier for them to be able to see that instead of having the students log in and showing them everywhere that everything's due. Yes. And you should be able to uh make that link of the calendar and the, that calendar in there. Um, as well. I lost little pieces, but I think I fully understand what you're saying. They're able to connect the calendars. So, yes, just that, those two arrows in a circle that allows them to see the options of how they'll sync those calendars. It's pretty easy. I've done it on my side. It gives you all the information right here and then they can connect those on their end. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you on the student application again where their name is in the top right hand corner, clicking down to see the first option is settings as a student. This will be all of the user details that were given to me once I was created as a user. But on the right hand side, I can put in any email or mobile number that I'd like with the coordinating carrier. So we see this a lot for parents and they can be notified of any of the following student notifications. So they would input their email and or mobile number, select their carrier and then come down here and they can choose either text or email depending on the notification. And then either daily or weekly of when the enrollment status changes, their grade drops below passing if they submitted an activity. Um someone replies to a discussion post. This is more in the high school level courses, not really in the younger grade. Levels. Um But if they're ever awarded a badge or they receive a score or feedback. So this is a great way to immediately connect with the parent's email and or number and just get notified of these few options here. And then the students also have the option to select from the avatar list. Should they want to pick an image for their profile and then they would just click save and refresh their browser to update anything that they had changed before we move on over to the teacher application? Did anybody have any questions of what we have covered or have not as far as the student application, you may have said this, but can they access um their activities from their calendar? Uh kind of like the to do list? Are they actually able to access from the calendar as well? Yes, absolutely. So if they select a day that actually has something to do with that color dot Anything they highlight over, they'll be able to click right in there and be able to work right from the calendar. And I will know um I don't have anything double due right now. But if they had multiple activities for one course, they would just have a little carrot button here and they would just click to expand and then they can click on each specific activity from there. OK. I have a, I have a question. Yes, ma'am. Um Is there like a standard or does it vary by grade level like this? Right. Thinker. Try to give students two activities a week per subject. Um, or does it just fluctuate depending on subject? And then, uh, the, the part where you showed where t where that you can sign up a parent's email address? J what's your, I'm sorry? Um, where you can set up the kid, the parents email address? Is that something that teachers can set up for them or would without having to log in through the parent portal? I mean, the student portal. Uh No, ma'am. So unfortunately, the notification settings will only be per user. So they would have to do that in their own settings per student. Um But they're very quick to access. So as soon as the student logs in, they can just click right from their name to the settings and then it's all right here for them. I was wondering if there was a way to lock that once you put in a email or a phone number. So the student couldn't go in and remove it. There's not. So it gives w freedom just for the ability. Should they put the wrong one in or they need to update it? It's there for them. Um But then back to your first question, Nadia, uh as far as pacing for the students, um can I ask which grade level you're teaching? Uh all, all grades? Sure. That's usually the answer for epic teachers. I just wanted to ask. Um Just because as of actually today, um the K through two courses have been given, let me go in here and find it so we can look at the same time. So if you're teaching K through two in the activities as a teacher, you'll see this course resource folder at the very top, you'll notice it's automatically hidden from the students. Should you want to show anything to the students you'll need to go in and allow students to see that. Um But within here, they have given an optional pacing guide. So this will help assist walking through the platform and knowing when things should be due. Um This is just kind of a basis should you need it? But if you're using a continuous course, it will pace out for the student. So with the continuous course, it's unique to each student. Of course, if one student starts in August and another student starts in September and they're still gonna take the entire course, they're gonna have a few more things due. Um But it really depends usually with the grades three through 12, it seems to be about one activity per day. But again, it's really dependent on the subject matter and what needs to be completed and things like that. Is it easy to modify those assignments for our fed kids? Like reduce questions or reduce answer choices? Yes, absolutely. So not on the teacher end and it might depend on what your uh um abilities within the administrator application are. So we'll look at those together once we switch over to the teacher side. Um but there's four accommodations that an administrator can set to each user. So with that, let me go over here. So when you have access to the users tab at the very bottom of the details, this is the four accommodations that can be set per user and this is across all of their courses. So never automatically assign zeros that's not going to be on anything by default. That's if a teacher goes into their course and decides they want to automatically assign zeros after past due activities, this student wouldn't be affected. You can also ignore any time limits on assessments. Should there be any also always allow speech stream that has been turned on across the board for epic? But should a teacher want to turn it off per course or per activity, then the student will still have access and then you can also limit the number of options on multiple choice questions. So if I put two here, then this student would only ever see two options across all multiple choice questions. But the another option that just became new available this year is those accommodated courses which will reduce those number of questions across all quizzes and practice tests and unit tests for students. Ok. This, that's fantastic. Um Can you just tell me one more time how you got here. And so this is just, you're just modifying this for Aaron Sullivan, right? So if I had 2/5 graders, one could have these accommodations and the other could go without them. Correct. Yes, ma'am. These are unique to each user. Um I didn't explain how I got here just because I wanted to make sure with lita that y'all had the ability to do this or is this something that you'll have to request by? Epic? Y'all do have specific teacher admin level permissions. Um But just because the school year ended, I wasn't ab actually able to see exactly what y'all have permissions on. Um And with, I'm not able to share my screen right now and show just because I would be showing student data if I were to go into y'all's actual site. So in your administrative settings, if you have the ability, you would just access. Um So right when you log in, you get the option of an admin or a teacher. If you accidentally click on teacher or you're already working in the teacher platform, you can use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner and that will allow you to switch over from admin to teacher if you're enrolled in as a student, that's how you'd switch to a student as well. So you'll want to be in the admin app and then you'll use that main menu and click down to the users tab and these are all fake students. I'm still in the training site. Um But you would click on the user id of your student and then scroll to the bottom and it's all right there for you. The only reason I say this is, I believe the last time that this was asked, y'all didn't have access to it so you can view it when it's here, but everything is grayed out. I don't know if that's been changed or not or if you all have access to it, but if you don't and it's all grayed out, you would just request that from Lida and, or another administrator. It's not lita um and they can come in here and add these accommodations per user for you. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I'm gonna switch back to the student app really quick. Did anyone else have any remaining questions before we switched over to the teacher's side? Megan? I wanted to mention, did you want to show the calendar how they can filter per day, week and month? Absolutely. That's a great one, Sophia. So I'm gonna go back to the calendar icon. Uh I'm sorry, calendar tab in the main menu. Um What Sophia was referring to is that if a student was on a specific day. So right now it's just gonna show the day that I'm clicking on. But if I come up here in the right hand corner where it labels the day, I can switch down to a week. So then if I'm just on this week, it'll still show me that Friday due date. If I click into this week, it'll show me everything due for this week or I can even show myself an entire month. That way the student doesn't have to be on the day and click into each day in order to see everything. Do. Thank you, Sophia. Of course, we have one more question from Andrea. Can we omit an activity for specific students and keep it for others? Yes, absolutely. So we'll just go ahead and switch over to the teacher side. A lot of the questions I think y'all are asking even prior to the training were in regards to the editor. So we'll go in there and look in that and then you all can see all of the different options of what you have for students. I'm gonna flick right back really quick. Is this where you were looking? Sophia was on the Yes and the chat. OK, perfect. I just wanted to make sure there was no questions in regards to the student application before I moved on student application looks good. All right. So again, in order to switch over to a different permission set from admin teacher student, you would use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner next to your name and then click over to switch. Um I forgot that I didn't enroll myself as a teacher So I'm actually going to log in as a teacher that I enrolled in the course. So one second, early credit. 223. Ok. All right. So this is very similar to what yours should look like. You should have admin or teacher. I'm gonna click into the teacher side and you'll notice everything looks very similar on the teacher's application that's intended so that if the students ever get lost or you need help with anything, nothing looks foreign to you. Everything is the same across the board, especially when you switch over to the administrative application as well. So I know that y'all had a lot of questions in the editor in order to get there. I'm gonna cover a couple of steps first. I just wanna make sure y'all didn't think I was forgetting about you. Um But right when you log in as a teacher, you'll still have that date here. And then um what's really great about this platform is that you'll have the needs grading right on your home page for you. So you'll have a notification of how many you have left to grade. You'll notice it's a three. Even if I click in here, I don't provide a grade for anything and I click right back out. That three is gonna remain there for me until I provide a grade for each of those three submissions. That way you don't ever have to get confused if you graded something or not it's always gonna remind you right here. You also have that announcements tab as a teacher that'll bring you to communication tab where you'll notice that there's any new announcements provided by an admin or you or another teacher created a new announcement. Um Only the teachers that are enrolled in the same courses of you that will is what you'll be notified of. So you won't be notified of other teachers that aren't in your courses. So I'm gonna click on that needs grading tab. And on the left hand side, you'll be able to see the three submissions here. And I wanted to show you the difference between these. So the first one is that first upload, I uploaded. If you remember where we showed the difference between the text or if you could use right from your device or use the upload and I chose the upload. So this is what you see as a teacher, you'll see the student's name, the course it came from, the activity is actually a hyperlink so that you'll be able to click right in there and see what the students saw as they were submitting. And then you'll also have the targeted versus submitted date scrolling down. You'll be able to see the student attachments and it keeps it all in one clean box for you. And then at the very bottom, anytime you see comments with a gray box, this is what the student also provided in the text box and then at the very bottom is a rubric provided for you. So you can actually typewrite within here grading per um section. And then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, it automatically calculates for me on the activity itself, you'll notice it's highlighted on content, clicking over to score and activity history is where I can see how many times the student submitted or I'm sorry, this is actually how many times the student visited the activity with a time stamp. But then the submission history is where you'll see that how many times they actually submitted the activity. And then all the way over to the right is class statistics. This is only applicable when more than one student has submitted and when it's in has a portion of automatic grading. So we'll look at one of those in a little bit. Um But all the way over to the right, this is where you can provide a score for the student. So I actually use the rubrics at the bottom and I'd like to keep my score. So I'm just gonna click submit score and then in the on the right hand side, you'll notice that that score populates for the student. So a seven out of eight was an 87.5%. Now, if I use this refresh in the top right hand corner, that'll refresh my list and anything that I've already graded will take out for me. So it can clear up some of that clutter. But let's say that it didn't have a rubric. So any, this is a great example of anything that's open ended, including with some of the automatic grading. So if I scroll throughout here, I can see what the student answered and what they got correct based on those automatic grading questions. But then anything that I need to grade will come to the top. So I can either use those points section where I can provide a grade and it will automatically calculate the rest of the score for me based on what the student answered or I can use this section in the top right hand corner. I can allow full credit which will give 100%. Keeping in mind it's not 100% just for these two questions. I need to grade. It's for the whole activity. So it's superseding anything they already provided as a grade. You can also allow no credit or clear out the score. You can revert to calculated, which is gonna give me that calculated score based on what they earned. You can also excuse which will take this out of the final scoring for the student's grade. They'll no longer be required to have this a part of their grade. It will excuse in the grade book and then they will no longer see it on their side. You can allow a retry again. This is only necessary should they exceed their amount that they had. So for lessons, quizzes, practices and unit test, there's a different amount that they have, but the lessons are unlimited. So you'll never need a quick allow retry for unlimited. But for the quizzes, they have two. So if they need that third additional retry, you can provide that here. You'll also then have the option to override complete. This will accept that failing score in the grade book. Should there be a reason that the student is not allowed to move forward with Epic? They should be able to move forward within the platform regardless. Um But should you ever run into that issue? You can always click override complete and then that will allow them to move on. And then at the very bottom in the right hand panel, you'll see that very familiar text box where you can insert an image video or audio as well as any emojis or text. And this will leave feedback to the t to the student and they'll see that in their notification center. So I'll click submit score and then again, I'll see that score provided and you'll also see that text box icon, the click down to my last submission. And so this is where you'll see an example. If the student just types a period or a dot exclamation point and clicks enter, you'll see that in the comments. So the comments is anything that the student has provided as an answer, you'll be able to click over to the score and activity history as well as the submission again. And then all the way over to the right underneath the feedback box, you also have the option to edit templates. So this is templates for feedback, if you click edit, that will allow you to create a template. So I'm gonna make this one for if the student did a great job in here and then you'll click done and now you have that template. So when I exit back out, instead of having to type into each students, the same feedback, I can just click right on that template and submit a score. So you'll notice you can't leave feedback unless you've also provided a score and that will populate once you provide a score at the top and then at the very bottom underneath templates, you also have returned attachments. So if you need to upload a file to attach with their feedback to the student, you can do that here as well as create a private note for yourself. So it'll remind you it is that it is hidden from the student. Should you need to remind yourself of anything here? And then you would just click submit score and again, that student would earn their score. Does anyone have any questions in regards to providing a grade for anything uploaded or um provided by the student? I had a really quick question. It was on the lesson just previous to this one that you um are showing, I think you um how to say it, but the questions weren't in order like the ones that you had to actually gray rather than multiple choice. Um You were able to pull those to the top. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So let me go back and then can you share that again? Yes. So it's gonna look a little bit different since I already submitted the score. But anytime you see something in the needs grading tab and the students have a combination where something is automatically graded by the platform, let's say eight out of the 10 questions. But then those two questions required, a teacher answer those two will always come back to the top. Ok? So they'll always ok. All right. Very good. So anytime you're in that needs grading tab, these two questions will be at the top for you. So you don't have to go search through the questions to find out which ones they'll be. Ok. Thank you. I was thinking that that was the setting of some type but ok. Very good. No, it makes it easy for you. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. So back in the teacher app, we were in that needs grading tab. I graded everything so you can use that main menu and you'll notice that it brings you down to the Needs grading. It's just another way to get there, but I'm gonna click on the home icon to get back to the main page next to the needs. Grading to the right is the announcements tab. This is where you can come as a teacher, you'll notice it brings you straight to the communication again. It's just that quick link from your home page. So you don't have to go to the main menu. Should you not want to? Um But in the top right hand corner, you'll have this speech bubble. So it has three lines and when hovered over it says new announcement, I just zoomed in. So I'm gonna go back out a little bit so it looks normal. Um But you'll click on that new announcement and this is where you can choose. So I'm only enrolled as a teacher in one course. But if you're enrolled in more than one, which I'm sure you are, you'll have all of your courses listed here and then you can check on the check boxes for which courses you'd like this announcement to be. So you can do it for one course, for five, for 10, for all three. It just depends on what you'd like and then you'll have a start and end date or you can display it indefinitely. So you forever and then you can, it does require a subject and then that same text box. So you can include any images that you have a youtube video, any text or emoji emojis here and then you can even edit the text if you'd like, make it bigger, change the color and then you would click post in the top right hand corner and then you'll notice because I created this announcement, I can edit this announcement or delete it because these announcements were not my own. I don't have the ability to edit or delete them, but you can also always click through here and edit any ones that you've created at any time or delete them. And then you'll also notice in the top right hand corner you have that paper icon. I heard a little noise. I wanted to make sure that wasn't anybody asking a question. I don't know if it's just me hearing the noises or not, but I don't usually work with Zoom. So I'm not sure if that's like someone raising their hand or asking a question. But let me know on my side. So I think you think Sophia, I was just hearing like little bells. I don't know. OK. But anyways, so there's that little paper airplane that allows you to send mail to your students. Or if you scroll, you can select a specific student enrolled in that course. Again, the student and yourself would need to have an email in your details page of your profile, not the notification that's separate. And then um you would need to re it requires a subject and then you can send a copy to yourself as well if you'd like. And this will send straight to the students email inbox. And then I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner to go back to my home icon again. So those were all the quick links right from your page. And then as a teacher in the top right hand corner, you have managed courses which is a little double sheet of paper. And the first drop down option is to order your courses. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course, but the more courses you have, they'll populate here and you can click and drag and reorder the courses so that you can select which courses populate at the top for you. So if you have a, let's say English courses that you need to provide more grades in or some other courses that you need to be more active in, you can bring them all to the top because I know y'all are enrolled in quite a bit of courses sometimes and then scrolling through here could be time consuming. So you can order those forces from that first icon in the top right hand corner. You can also view past courses from here at the very bottom. Should you ever need to? So you still have all the same icons and you can click right into that course and view anything you need. And then lastly, you also have the ability to view slash delete courses. Um So again, we highly highly recommend never deleting anything in brighter because you never know if that's gonna delete all the scores, the grade book, anything that you need in there. Um But this is where you can just hide the course from your title. So let's say that you're still enrolled for another month, but that was little excessive for you. You didn't need it for another month and you just don't no longer want it on your page. You can just hide that from yourself. And then when you go to your home page, it's just no longer showing for you. So let's say you had 10 horses and you wanna hide five of them from yourself so that they're no longer cluttering your page. You can do that and you can always come back and unhide it from yourself as well. All the way over to the right where your name is as a teacher, you can click down and you'll have the same settings. So you also have a notification preferences very similar to the student email and or mobile number, but then you would scroll to your teacher notifications and you have the options to be notified of when a student submits something. So this is actually gonna be when a student submits anything. So it's not just any open ended or essay that require you to grade. We have put that as feedback to buzz, which is our learning management system we use um that holds the bright thinker content, but we've requested that, that be separated. So that's an option. But as of right now, this is just any time a student submits something. So now that um if a student submits an automatically graded assignment, you'll still be notified of that. Just keeping that in mind and then anytime a student's grade drops be passing or if a student's enrollment status changes. So with those three options, we highly recommend to either use email or if you specifically have T Mobile, then it's ok. But some of the other carriers, we've gotten feedback like cricket or I can't think of the other one. So via chime in if you can, but those actually notify you with separate text messages. So every single time that it's submitted, you'll get a new number, texting you. So your inbox will be full and it's just not the best sometimes. But with T Mobile, we've heard feedback and with emails, it'll all come as one text message. So uh for lack of better terms, it's one number that it comes from. So you get separate texts within one number, but you won't be bombarded with 500 different threads of texts. Um Outside of that, you also have the option to upload an image. So the students don't have this option in their avatar, you can click the plus button and choose a picture right from your profile, right from your device. So you can choose a personal picture of yourself or a picture of your dog, anything you wanna include, um, or you can choose an avatar just as the students do and then anytime you change anything in your settings, you'll wanna click save and refresh to allow those to take place. And then that'll bring you back to your main page in your main window. As a teacher in the top left hand corner, you'll have that needs grading tab, same exact from the one on the main page. You'll also have notes as a teacher very similar to the students. If you take notes in the lessons or anytime you see that notes icon, you can come back here for reference. Underneath. There is a communication that is where we were brought earlier with the announcements. It's the same page and then the calendar as a teacher also shows you anything that's due. Please keep in mind this will not be identical to the student unless your enrollment dates are identical in a continuous course. Meaning if a student isn't enrolled until August, but you have early access in July, your due dates will not line up with the students. It's gonna take your starting in date and line everything out then and again, that's only for a continuous course. So if you have a range course and you are set to set the due dates, then those will be identical to the students. Um But outside of that, everything is very similar, they are quick links, you can go to as a teacher and then you can switch between day, week and month back underneath the main page. You have a new tab that the students do not, which is the people tab. So this is going to show everyone enrolled in every single course that you have. So this will give a quick snapshot of everyone that you have access to as a student in the top right hand corner. The gear icon is where I recommend you go first. This will allow you to select what you view in the people tab. I like to turn everything on and then I click save and it's gonna give you quite a bit of options. So if you don't need everything in here, that's totally fine. You can click it off. Um But I just wanna show you all of the options that you have. So the first is the co I'm sorry. Could you, could you show me again how you got to that last screen? Yes. So I'll go back a couple of steps just in case anybody else is a little bit confused on how I got here in the main menu. In the top left hand corner, I navigated down to the people tab and then in the people tab all the way over to the right. The gear icon is how I selected what I wanted on in this page and then you click save and everything has been turned on here. So the first icon is the accommodations. Um So those ones we just spoke on earlier as far as um speech stream being turned on all the time limiting the number of questions per multiple choice um across the board for the students, all four of those are going to show the teacher right here. So I don't have any um accommodations as far as this user. So I'm actually gonna go in and turn an accommodation on really quick so we can see what that looks like. I'll turn them all on. Ok. So now that I have an accommodation set for this user as a teacher, I can click in the people tab and be able to see what those accommodations are. So accommodations for this student and then they have everything turned on and then they'll just give you notifications of those. Um And then Sophia did update me via lita since her microphone is not working, all epic courses are continuous. So I will continue the training with just speaking on continuous courses to not confuse you. So sorry about that before, but everything will be automatically paced out for the students. So based on their enrollment start and end date, everything will pay for them. So that is true. If you're given early access as a teacher and you don't have the exact enrollment dates as a student, it'll be a little bit different in the calendar just keeping that in mind. Um But next to the accommodations you can see the overall score the student has and let's say this right. Thinker student was enrolled in four different courses. They will actually populate four different times and the course that you're looking at will be listed right underneath their name. So for this specific course, this is their score and amount of time they spent there, I can see their understanding, interest and effort level. If they completed their heart, heart icon and the date it was changed and then scrolling over, I can see the progress and mastery. The online indicator is my personal favorite. This will show me any time a student is logged in at the exact same time as me. And then you also have the pace and performance indicated by a green yellow or red dot So this student's pace is on schedule, but their performance is currently failing in the courses. And then you can see any badges and anything that any badges they earned, anything today that they submitted any failed assignments or late as well and then the end date for this student. So this is the quickest way to come and see. The last date that the student has to submit is December 28th 2022 for this course and then back up in the left hand corner to the main menu underneath the people. Tab is our customer support link. So this is where you can come and click. This will bring you right to a new tab and this is where you can either provide feedback, report, an issue or a bug or submit a help ticket. Um So we actually also have access to your Epic quick start guide, which I'm gonna open really quickly, which has been beautifully updated by LITA. Um But everything in here is specific to Epic and bright thinker. So any questions that you may have, it can easily be found in here and you can click control, find and just type in anything that you need to find and it will update here for you. I'm not saying that we are not here to help you with any additional questions. It's just a quick guide to help you. Should you need it. And I'm sure Leah can provide that link if anybody doesn't have it. And then back in the main menu underneath the customer support tab, we're actually gonna skip over clipboard for today. It's a little bit more advanced. Um but I'm gonna click on the more reports option. So this will allow you to pull a PDF version of any of these reports. So we have a student daily activity of progress and a grade details. So I'll show you an example of what that looks like the student daily Activity report. It's gonna show you time stamps of everywhere. The student was logged into the platform and how long and then the grade details report will give you a quick overview of the course that the students in. So a course grade their progress and then all of the grades that they have earned thus far. And again, those can be found in your more reports. Tab lastly, you have access to that student resources identical to the students on their side. Should you need it? And then your any courses you're enrolled in will populate in the bottom left hand corner as well with a color co ordination. I'm gonna click back on the home icon and now we're gonna focus on the course card. So yours similar to the student, but you have extra access. So you'll still have a course card with the image coordinating to each course, the course title as well. And then you have the activities icon, your grade book, the reports for each course, which is different from the more reports tab. You also have the people tab from here, which is a more in depth look of the people tab. So the one from your main menu is gonna encompass all of the students. This one is just for this course and then you also have the editor. So I'm gonna click on the play button first is very similar to the student. This is where you come and you can use the pencil icon to edit the landing page. So you can put anything you want here, you can change this daily, weekly, monthly, leave it the entire year, whatever is best for you and then scrolling down, you'll be able to access the activities just as a student does. So for example, if you wanted to come in here and view this eighth grade language, arts activity, you can see it exactly as the students see it. But even further in the top right hand corner, you can see that you're viewing ads yourself if you click here and the first drop down is view ads. This allows you to select a specific student. So I know that my student has already completed it. I'm gonna select, ok. Now I can see the score, they see I can go down to their submission. I'm able to see exactly what they have submitted. I can see that they have a retake available to them and I can even view their grade details as well. So this is the quickest way you'll be able to confirm a few different things without having to log in with credentials of a student or ask them on their end. You'll be able to just see right from here. I'm gonna use the back arrow in the top left hand corner to be brought back to the main page. And then this is just where you'll come. If you wanna do anything in the course such as the students, I'm gonna use the main menu in the top left hand corner. And now that I have selected this specific course, you'll notice my menu changed again. So this is the sub menu just for this course, the same icons we saw on the course card on the main page. So I'm gonna click down to the grade book. There's a couple cool features in here in the top right hand corner, you have a gear similar to how you have in the people tab. This is where you can select what you'd like to see in your grade book so you can choose user name. The last time the students logged in minutes spent in the course accommodations, um any progress or enrollment status and then any footers that you want. So if there's missing or low scores, anything like that and then at the very bottom, you'll have a box titled tools. This will allow you to export to a different course. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course. It's not gonna show me any other courses, but you'll have a list of other courses with check boxes and you can export the same settings you just chose here to all of your other courses. So you don't have to click into the grade book settings for each of your courses and change all of the settings. It'll just across the board, change for you. And then anytime you make changes, you wanna click save here and everything will apply. So I see that same accommodations flag I saw in the people tab, you can click there and view what those accommodations that student has their score per activity. And then in the top right hand corner next to the gear icon, once to the right is your lightning bolt which enables quick editing. This allows you to click any cell in the grade book, whether it has already earned a score been provided by you or is blank and you can enter in a score right from here. So you type in the score and click enter, you also can enter in an X and that will automatically excuse the assignment. So when someone asked earlier, if you can excuse an assignment for one student, but not all of the everyone in the course, this will be the quickest way, especially if you only have a couple assignments that you're trying to excuse for the student. This will allow you to go in and excuse and then you'll wanna make sure to turn that lightning bolt off so that you can go back in and not be affecting the score. Should you not want to anymore? Next to the lightning bolt is a tool. Um A wrench icon when clicked on this will allow you to export your scores. Should you need them in a CS V file? So it's just an Excel spreadsheet. I'll go ahead and export it so we can see what it looks like. Should you need the scores externally? It'll just show you that quickly for you outside of here. I'm gonna click and back into the grade book. So this is where you can do a couple different things. If you click into any scores already earned, this will show you the same tab as the needs grading tab we saw earlier. So you can come and adjust grades as you had before. You can edit your templates and then you can view with the submission history and the score activity from here if it is something that was automatically graded, so I'll go into the quiz, you'll be able to see all the answers. So you had not provided a score for this. This is automatically graded. Um but you do have the ability to change the score. So should, for whatever reason you decide that this student should earn court points for the justice question. You can go in and adjust the points for that question. It'll automatically update the score and you will need to click submit if you wanna save that score and then you'll notice the updates already for you. Another really cool thing in the grade book is if you click on the actual title of each of the activities on the click on quiz two, this will bring me into the stats. So if I had multiple students, it would list them all here the last time they logged in their status and score. But if I click over to analytics on the top, right, then I can scroll and see how the students answered. So again, I only have one student in here. But this will give me class statistics, 100% of this class answered the question wrong. This is the correct answer and so on, you can see 100% answered correctly. So if I decide that the students were not fairly questioned on this quiz, and I want to remove the question from score, I can do that here. And that will automatically give scoring back to each of the students that got the answer incorrect. So then if I use the back arrow, we can see the student did get that question incorrect. So now their score went up even higher automatically without me having to do anything else. Does anyone have any questions in regards to the grade book, how to change anything, anything like that? Perfect. So I'm gonna click back on the main menu in the top left hand corner underneath the grade book is the reports tab. These are all per course and will pull as a CS V file. So none of these are gonna be the PDF that would be in the more reports on the main menu. Um but this will allow you to pull a, a report on the grade book or the student in regards to performance on all of their courses or just in specific courses. Um Should you need any reports externally and then back in the menu menu underneath the reports is again another people tab, but this one is unique to this course. So it's only going to show you the students enrolled in this course and you'll notice I don't have all the options again just because it's a completely different people tab. I would need to go into that gear icon in the top right hand corner and select what I'd like to see on this people tab. But in the main menu, the last option when in a course is the editor. So this is how you're gonna come and see a lot of different things for bright thinker in the bottom left hand corner, you'll see a carrot right here to expand the left panel right now. I'm just in a course for actually, I have a meeting. But let me go back out, I'm just in a demo. So I actually don't have any standards aligned, but I'm gonna go into an Oklahoma course. So you can see what that would look like. So let's just pull up fourth grade El A. So when you're in the editor, let's say this is your actual course. You'll use that expansion arrow and then all of the standards that align with fourth grade El A for Oklahoma will be right here. But then when you open each unit, you'll be able to see what is covered for activity. So thats gonna be how you view standards within the course itself again in the editor and then you just expand on the left hand side to view, but I'm gonna go back really quick to the Doma demo. And then within each course, when you want to view something in the activity list, you'll need to open that unit folder with the carrot button and then that's how you'll see those activities in order to view correct questions. There's two ways you can do that in writing, thinker. So with any activities that have automatic grading like this, 4th, 8th grade, El A, I'm gonna use that pencil icon all the way to the right. And that will allow me to access all of the details and I'll click over to the questions tab and these are all the correct answers. Another way to view the correct answers on the exit out of here is it will be listed right beneath it. So if it's an upload, that isn't unique to a student answer, it's not gonna have 100 different possibilities of an answer. For example, math, it'll just have one or two. depending on the content, you will have an answer key listed right below. You can see this in the activities page as well actually. Um But when you're in the editor, you will go all the way over to the right using that triple dots and click preview. And this will allow you to preview the correct answer sheet for that activity. So this is an example of an activity, the student would upload work. There's only one possible right answer. So you'll have that answer key. When grading, I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. So again, the two different ways is either if it's already automatically graded and it has the answers in the platform, you use that pencil icon to go to the questions tab or if it has the answer key right beneath it, you'll use the triple dots all the way over to the right and preview underneath there. So all the way over to the right, you have three different icons. The first is an eyeball. So this will automatically excuse that assignment for everyone enrolled in the course. So let's say you wanted to hide the entire unit, the unit is closed here. So then I could just click the eyeball. And when I spanned the unit, everything within the unit is going to be hidden from the students. If you uncheck that eyeball, everything is then revealed again. So the benefit of the eyeball is if half the students have worked in there and half have not, if you hide the activity, everything will be taken out of the grade book, the students will no longer be able to see it, they'll not be required to work. But if you reveal it at any point, then all of those scores are able to come back. So that's why we recommend using the eyeball instead of deleting because it's kind of a safety net for you. But then you can also hide just the lessons within here or you can hide just one quiz. Um But keeping in mind any of the eyeballs here will hide from everyone in the enrolled in the course. So all students then next to the eyeball icon is that pencil editor outside of the questions tab, this is where you can see the settings. So all the settings across the board have been set for Epic. Um These are not Epic settings, these are just my demo course settings. Um But the number of temps is already there for you. Everything across the board has been submits this activity. I know last year there were some issues. If you're a returning teacher that students weren't able to move forward, it was making you grade things, we've changed that across the board. So students should be able to submit and move forward regardless of the score they received regardless if there's anything to grade or not. Um And then the passing score has been set to 60 as well. So everything can be found in that pencil icon to the right of the eyeball and then all the way over to the right of there is the triple dots. This will allow you to preview the activity. You can also move up or down or to a different unit. Should you need to, you can duplicate the activity as well or you can copy it to your library. So when you click copy to my library on the right hand side. If this isn't already expanded, you'll have another Carrot here to expand and the icon all the way over to the right is my library and you'll notice that copied in right here. The benefit is that we'll stay with you as a user. So if you would want to use this in a different course, at any point in time, you'll always have that activity with you, especially if you customize it from scratch or you need a completely different activity, you can copy it to your library and then that allows you to click and drag anywhere you'd like to have it. Um I have a quick question. Um And I'm sure you, you probably already said this. So I apologize but um when you click the pencil and then you can edit those settings and you can edit like how many attempts and stuff. What um this is all standard. So like is our default gonna be that they'll have two attempts. Um So let me go in. It is going to be the default for you, but the ones that we were looking at were not already epic settings. These are though. So let me go in here. So actually for lessons, the students have unlimited attempts for epic. But yes, this is where you would go to see the default settings that were already set um And or change them. Should you need to? Ok. So we're giving students unlimited attempts on assignments on lessons category. Yes, on the lessons. Ok, thanks. Yep. And then um further in there with that epic quick start guide again, if you do not have access to it, I'm sure lita already put the link in the chat. Um But at the very bottom is where all the settings are. So if you wanted to come and, and I think these are already updated. Yes. So they said changing to 60% for the school year. Um But everything in here is the settings that have already been applied by default to your courses. So that's at the very bottom of the quick start guide. Ok. And where is the quick start guide? One more time? I'm gonna a bookmark it. That's OK. I actually don't have the link to provide but lita if you don't mind putting that in the chat, I think she already did. Yeah. So if you see the chat of the zoom that we're in. Lita provided it in there, I also included it on the epic one bright thinker channel. Perfect. Thank you Lida. OK. So let me exit back out of there. Um So that is how you can move things around from the far, right, the triple dots, you're able to move things around copper library. Again, we highly recommend delete, not deleting, not to know. Um But you can also click and drag. So let me open a full instructional unit so we can see um keeping in mind if I click and drag this qui quiz two to be before quiz one, everything is meant to be in sequential order for bright thinker. So everything in quiz two encompasses less than 45 and six or whatever was prior to it. So if I go down here less quiz three is in company encompassing 78 and nine. So if I move it before those, the students are gonna be quizzed on things they might not have ever seen. So just keep that in mind when you're moving things around and editing and adding in your own things. Um and then at the very bottom left hand corner, the add activity. So it's kind of hard to see. Um but it's the very last option on your syllabus, you can click add activity and then anything in the first 3rd and 4th quadrants. So the L shape at the bottom will be blank. So you can add in an assessment and activity file attachment, youtube video and it will not contain anything in regards to bright thinker. So that's how you can um customize your own activities, add in flash cards, a journal, anything you like here. But then in the top right hand corner where it says library, you will be able to access your master courses. So you'll click open on that file. It'll take a minute because it's actually opening every single course that bright thinker offers. So let's say you are teaching fourth grade science and you want to supplement some third grade science and you can open this uh course, you can open any of the units that you wanna view and you can even preview the lesson before adding it in. So you'll scroll through, make sure this is the lesson you wanna add in. Then you'll click add to cart. It's not gonna cost any money. It's just the titling system they used. You'll have to click the cart button in the top right hand corner and then you'll always wanna click link. The difference is that link will link it back to the master so that any updates we make, it'll still come through to yours. All of the images will come through and all of the video as well as well. Um And the way that you can ensure that it was actually linked in is you'll see that little link icon. So actually all of these have it because I linked them in versus if it was already in your course, it does not have that little link icon thing. Um But then that will come in and you can click and drag that wherever you should need it. And then let's say you already have a lesson to. You'll wanna click on the pencil icon and you can change the title and then it'll look as if it was always there for the student. The only thing indication that it has come from a different grade level is state specific courses. Oklahoma. Third grade history, it'll actually show that it says third grade history in the lesson itself. That's something that can't be changed. Um And then all of the K through two courses have little videos throughout and they actually have a title with the grade level in there. But other than that, the title of the actual lesson um within the lesson itself for third through fifth grade outside of Oklahoma, it's not going to tell them that this came from a lower grade level or a higher grade level, whatever you're going from, I'm gonna click back out of here. So that is pretty much everything within the editor syllabus section. But then you'll notice in the top there's a couple different tabs. So I'm gonna click over to weights. This is where you can view the category weights. So again, I'm gonna use actually a different course, for example, because mine's not a great one. Um But you'll be able to see how the course is waited. So you have lessons, quizzes, practice as a unit test and then you'll even be able to open those and see what is encompassing between those. So you can ensure that you know that that lesson is 25% of their overall grade versus this unit test is 50. Um These are not epic settings. These are my demo ones. Again, let me go and see what epics are. Oh, actually they are. Yep. Epic uses the same one. So it's 2525 0 50 for lessons, quizzes, practices and human tests. And then next to that, we have the activity list. So this is within the editor. Let me close. I'm actually gonna get out of here. So I don't actually change anything in our master. Um But in the activity list, this is where you can come and filter so you can type in quiz. Um You can type in lesson anything you want to change all at one time. Um And just keeping in mind that when you type in lesson, that's also gonna populate the answer key and things like that. So just be aware of what's populating on that list, but I'll do a quiz for an easy example and then you can check box the box at the very top right hand corner and that will check everything on for you. And then in the top right where that pencil icon is to bulk edit, that will allow you to do a couple different things in bulk. So if it's grayed out, that's not allowing you to do that in bulk, just because a specific there might be one or that whole activity type is not allowing you to do it in bulk for whatever reason. But if that check box lets you check it on, then this is how you can quickly do a couple different things in the platform. So who the activity is visible to that is the eyeball icon. So this is hiding, if you change to teachers only or teachers and observers, it will hide from all of the students. So it's automatically excusing for all of the students at one time, everything that you checked on, you can also change the location. So if you wanna put all of these quizzes to one folder and move everything at one time, you can do that. You can also change the passing score quickly from here. Again, it's set to 60 for epic. But if you want to, if there's a couple quizzes that were off and you wanna make sure they're all 60 you can do that here. Um assessment password. If you want to require the students to enter a password before they take the assessment. Again, this is going to encompass everything that you check on for. So it would be required to be across the board. And then you can also change the number of attempts for quiz. It's currently two, but you can put in custom and change the amount here as well. You'd wanna click the check box confirming that you understand it's permanent update and then that will automatically update all of the items that you checked on there for you. Um Also from this tab, you can preview, so using that triple dots, you'll, you're able to preview this assessment, should you want to before you edit it and then all the way over to the right is group settings. So this was a question that someone had in regards to how to hide maybe an entire unit from one student instead of everybody at the same time. So the lightning bolt in the grade book that we spoke on earlier is the quickest way to excuse one or a few activities from one student or a couple students. Um depending on what you're doing. But if you need to hide an entire unit or a couple units, that might be a little conti time consuming in the grade book. So you can create groupings um within the group settings, you would need to click the wrench icon in the top right hand corner and down to manage groupings and this will allow you to add a group. So for example, I'm just going to put start dates here. So I'm gonna have a few students that are starting at different dates and I might wanna hide some things from them. So the group creation method, I'm gonna do a fixed number of groups because I want there to specifically be two groups. But you can also do a target number of students per group. And then you can select how many students are in groups and that'll based off of how many groups there are. Um And then the group assignment I always select none because I want to choose which students go into which groups. But you can depending on which types of groups you're creating, select random round robin alphabetical the same or different by performance and, or um by the different quarters. Um top or bottom, things like that. So I'm gonna click generate with none. And so then it's automatically gonna give me an, a title right here in the top right hand corner where you have the edit groups with the pencil, you can change this title that it automatically gave you. So I'm gonna title this August, my students that are starting in August and then I'm actually gonna have some more students starting later. So I'll use this little people with the plus button to add a group and then again, I can edit that name and let's say these students start in September. Perfect. So I'm gonna put my student in one group. If for whatever reason, the type of groups that you're determining, you can check off this box and allow your student to be encompassed in both groups. Um But I just want one. So then I'll click save and you'll assign all your students to whichever group you need. And now I have my start date groups. So I'm gonna click the back arrow and then you'll notice you're choosing your grouping. So if you have multiple groups, you can select which one you're affecting right now and then where you're at and then view by either the property, the activity itself, which is the group or the groups will align on the right hand side. So I like to be in property. It's the least confusing for me personally. And then you can either you can change the visibility. So this is only for my students starting in August and this is only for my students starting in September and which groups I put them in. So now I can go in and I'm actually only in the core content, but I'll go back up to the full course. I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in September or I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in August. That way you can hide multiple units, multiple activities from specific groups of students and you don't have to do it from your main page, hiding it from everyone. And I know we went through that rather quickly. We do have a PDF walking through every step and what everything means. And of course, if you have any questions and there's interest in the need of an advanced workshop, we can always do that as well. But I'm gonna go back to my questions tab that you all had um on questions that you asked. And then Sophia, if there's anything in the chat that's not in here, please let me know. Um I, I have a quick question on the groups. Is that something that you said we'll talk more about in the advanced class? Yes. OK. And we have a PDF as well. That kind of gives like a description in depth of every option that you can select. And also this year we're gonna talk about um during office hours uh at the beginning of the year, Megan and Sophia have agreed to join us the first week um on one of the days. So if you have questions or as you guys are getting into it with students and have questions, you can join us as well. But then also um throughout the year, we're going to have specific skills that kind of go along with that time of year uh that we will highlight and um do a video tutorials on as well during office hours. Yes. And the benefit of office hours that we've done in the past is it gives us the opportunity that we only um have one teacher in the, we have the ability to only have one teacher in the zoom meeting at one time and we don't record those. So that way if you have a specific question and you need to share your screen with student data, something's going on with your specific student, we can walk through that and look at your screen together um outside of a group setting where we can't share student data. OK. So I'll just start from the top. One of the questions that was asked is how can we edit calendar pacing for the to do list but not affect the course and date to prevent the course from expiring. Um So the only way to edit the to do list is if you're in a range course mode and that allows you to edit all end dates. But the difference with that is it doesn't give um pacing for the students. And so all of the courses for Epic right now are currently in continuous. So you would not be able to edit those to do estate um outside of changing their enrollment and dates, which is I know was a part of the question said not to. So, but if you do change the enrollment starter and date, that will obviously change the pacing for the student, um I might need a little bit clarification on the next question, but I will go off what I think you're asking and then if you're in the zoom call, let go ahead and let me know if I'm incorrect. But the next question is, can parents slash students change from their app if they want to work ahead? So Epic actually doesn't um for lack of better terms, gate students. So you can work as far ahead as you want and they actually don't even have to work in sequential order. So the students are able to work wherever whenever, as far ahead as they want. That was from a question who from someone who said she wasn't able to make it. Ok. Hopefully you are watching the video back and then if you have another question um or I didn't answer that correctly, please just let Lita or myself know and we can further discuss that. And then the next question was where can I hide things from student view? We covered that in the course editor with the eyeball icon. Even further, you can also hide things from students using the lightning bolt in the grade book with the X and enter and that will excuse it from a specific student. Um How can I change the number of attempts on quizzes, practices or exams? Um That's what we covered earlier, either by the pencil icon in the settings or in that activity list of the editor where you can do multiple things at one time and then same thing with the past threshold, it's gonna be in those settings or in the bulk editing feature. Will the K through two have social studies and science? Um We do provide social studies and science on the bright thinker side from K through two. It might just be that lita and the team are working on them. So you might not see them in the demo just yet, but we do offer them. Um And then can you show us how students take notes? We did cover that in the student side. But if you are still confused on that or have a question, please let me know is there a specific writing course for fourth through eighth to match PS grade books? Lita you might need to help me with that one. I'm not sure what a PS grade book is. The PS is Power School. Um, got it. Yeah, we're doing the, the talking back and forth between, uh, bright thinker and power school to automatically load the grades. So they have to have the same settings and the same forces. Got it. Ok. But I think four through eight we just have English. Correct. Yes. Mhm. As far as what brand thinker offers? Yes. And then is there a general supply list? And that was already answered, they will be shared on the bright thinker channel of epic one. I did wanna mention some of the supply lists as far as we know what you have access to might not be updated just because they have updated all of those courses as of this year. Um So if you're a teacher looking for a supply list, let me go back into the platform at the top of I closed it out. Let me go back in really quick. At the top of any of your courses, you have the ability to view the supply list, the teacher guides, anything like that. So for a K through two course, when you're in the activities, you'll have course resources as a teacher, this one has a pacing guide and then underneath each unit will have the teacher guide and a unit workbook for the students to be able to print everything they need. Should they need it. But in that teacher guide for K through two is where you can find the supply list in here. Um If they have any that's needed and then they also give you supplemental material. Should you wanna add anything outside of what is already covered? And then for those older grade levels, I'll pull up an example. We'll go to fre map. I don't think that fifth grade math will have a supply list, but anything that is needed at the top will be in a PDF for you. Um So this is gonna let you know the course manipulatives needed um throughout the course. And then I know for like some of those higher level courses like biology, they also have course resources at the top. So um teacher guidelines with, with or without the lab manual and then if there's any principles, those will also be within the unit as well. So right within the course, it'll hold that supply list or anything that the students need. Um So we recommend definitely going into the course itself once you have access to them to ensure that's everything that's updated for your specific courses. Um But we are working to update those supply list that you have access to Rita. Ok. And I have access to those courses, so I should be able to pull those. Correct. Absolutely. Mhm. Ok. Um And then one other thing too is last year Lindsay went in and found the, um, the novels that are required for each of the, the uh classes and she put together a tablet that has access to those novels as well. How wonderful. That is awesome. Um, the, yes, the required reading list. I think you have access to this one later, but this will list out everything that's externally required as far as a novel in each grade level and where it's used in each unit as well. Um Let me see where we left off. Is there an upload limit? So I took note of that. I don't believe that there is especially not what the students would be uploading. Um But again, I'll check with Buzz RL MS just to make sure um lita before our advanced workshop, if you have time, let's schedule a time so that we can discuss the admin level permissions that teachers have. Um Just because no one is currently enrolled in courses. So I wasn't able to see that and I didn't want to misanswer anything. Ok. Ok. Awesome. The next question was about how many activities per subject can students expect a week? So again, that's gonna be dependent on their start and end date. As far as the continuous course, it'll automatically pace everything out for them. But if there is a pacing guide at the top of the course for K through two or externally for these other courses, that'll help you just get an idea of what's due and how much is due and then how can the teacher see what standards are covered that's gonna be in that editor. But of course, if you have any questions on how to get back there, let me know and I'll show that again. Sophia, was there any questions in the chat that were not covered in the spreadsheet or what we just discussed? No, I believe you covered it all. Ok. Awesome. Did anybody else have any remaining questions? I have. Oh, go ahead. Ok, real quick. Um, I just added a question. I don't even know if you can see it yet, but are we able to get a copy of that required reading list? Like the books that are required? Yeah. Um, lita, I will send an email over to you and then however you want to make that available. I'll let that be up to Epic. Ok. Thanks. And thank you. Of course. I think someone else had a question at the same time. It, was that the same one or do you have a different one? Uh, yeah, I just kind of maybe wanted your input or some, maybe some other, uh, if there's any other special education, uh, Epic teachers. I've got kind of mixed reviews from teachers who have used. Right. Thinker in the past. Um, some of them are like, it's overwhelming that the additional, uh, like supplies and stuff that they'll need, you know, offline in the curriculum and then some people, um, are like, no, it's usually just like basic stuff that's laying around the house, like for science experiments or for other projects and different subjects. Um I'm primarily gonna be using this for my K through eighth grade uh classes. So, um, did you have any, any thoughts on that? I do. Yes, I do. So, we have gotten that feedback from a lot outside of just epic. And this year was one of the major changes that the curriculum team has gone in and updated the courses and I know they're just gonna continue to be updating them. Um But they have gone in and made more accessible um labs. So let me go in here and show you Sophia. Do you remember the specific courses that they made changes to? I don't have the list on hand. I don't. Exactly, but I can check on my side also. Ok, let me see if I can find an example. Let's talk about them. Ok. So they've gone in, I think it was the higher grade levels in eighth grade, which is not helping you specifically. I'm sorry about that. But I, they might have changed eighth grade as well. Um But I know that they're going in and they're making more virtual labs, more things accessible to students that are um at home, not using the labs specifically in a classroom. Um But if you still see any remaining labs, you are more than welcome to hide them and if you have other labs that you'd like to use, please feel free to do that. But I know that the curriculum team is going in and they're updating some of those so that they are more accessible because there are a few that require things like um a balance beam that students might not have access to or a microscope and different things like that. So, ok, that was my kind of my follow up thought there was maybe to just omit it if it was too complicated and that won't have too big of an impact on. I mean, it'll have an impact but not too big of an impact on their grade or. Well, I guess if you admit it, it won't have any impact on their grade but correct, but it wouldn't be hindering them from learning anything for like a specific quiz or la um test or anything like that. All the labs are separate. So the quizzes will just cover the lessons themselves and then the practice and unit test will cover the quizzes and um lessons. OK. Good, good to know. And it's really easy to going through the editor to add a dry lab too if you wanted to. Um So if you have like a video like on youtube, that maybe corresponds to what the lab was, you can upload that with some questions that they can then do in lieu of the lab that's listed there. OK. Good idea. In that advanced workshop, we'll be covering more in depth on the different types of activities. You can create how to do those groupings, more in depth, how everything applies to each other. So in the meantime, from this um meeting to the next, if you have any questions for LITA or you're like, I really wanna learn more advanced on this. Please let us know and we'll make sure to cover that in the next training and we'll keep the spreadsheet open. So if you uh go away and come back with some more questions, you can update that spreadsheet and we'll definitely keep looking at that for uh the next training as well. Awesome. I just wanted to give a couple of seconds to make sure nobody had any other questions, but it seems like they've all been answered. So me and Lida will meet together before our next meeting and make sure that I'm aware of all of the settings that you'll have access to as far as um in regards to your administrative training or your administrative application so that I can fully answer all your questions. We'll go in more in depth as far as um the different types of activities you can create in epic specifics. And then as long as everybody has access to that epic quick start guide, I think that will be very beneficial to you. All the required reading actually might be right within that quickstart guide if I remember correctly but um I will send that in an email to LITA and then she will inform you on where that is available. But thank you for all your time today. It has been a pleasure and yes, le to put in the chat. The next meeting is Wednesday, August 10th and I have one, just one note about that August 10th. I believe that is a professional development epic professional development day. Ok. Does that mean you all have a lot of other trainings that day as well? Yeah, we have to travel to Oklahoma City that day, but the way they do it now, I think it's just by teams. I'm not sure if it's everyone. Uh Luta, do you know, will we just watch the recording if, if that's the case? Yes, I'll definitely make sure everything's recorded and available and if you wanted to, if you've got questions that you want us to cover and you're not able to go, you can always add up to that spreadsheet and we'll make sure that we cover it in, in the course as well. Ok. Awesome. Thank you for the input. I had no idea. So, yes, the next meeting would be August 10th at 1 p.m. If you're welcome. If you're able to join, we would love to have you. But of course, if not, we'll report it again and make sure you get that. That is all I have to share for you today. Lida. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? Um No, I just thank you guys for joining us and having these great questions and conversations. It's definitely we wanna make sure it's tailored for what you guys need. So awesome. Thank you so much.\"), (1870, 495, 3431, \"Have on Epic. So Lita started the recording. I'm just gonna reexplain for those that are not here today. And my name is Megan. I'm a part of bright thinkers, professional development team. We're gonna be walking through the student's application as far as what they can submit, what they're able to see on their side, all of the different features within Epic. And then we'll also look at a teacher's end and everything that you have a accessible through Epic, you all have a specific role. And so especially if you are a returning teacher and you notice something or you have a question about something, please don't hesitate to take your microphone off or throw something in the chat and just let us know specific Epic things. Um And then of course, if you have any questions that are regarding Epic specific leader will be throughout the chat as well. Um So Lena mentioned that y'all have a spreadsheet that was shared with us, which is questions for bright thinker. Um And it looks like yes, I'm still sharing my screen so you're able to see it. And these are just a few of the questions that came in. So we're actually gonna walk through the demo first because it's just basics of what it looks like and then we'll come back to the questions. So if you have any, please throw those in the chat or for Sophia or Lita and then you can also add to that spreadsheet and I should get updates. Um, but if not, if you don't see your question updated, just let me know at the end. All righty. So this is what it looks like for anyone in bright thinker when they click log in. Um As a teacher, you might see a couple different permission sets, you should as an epic teacher have the option as an administrator or a teacher. Mine says student because I'm enrolled as a student. Um So we're gonna start on that side when you're in the course. I'm actually gonna change my color really quick. I like it at blue. It's less distracting for me. Um But I know y'all's color is orange. So when we start as a student logging into the platform in the top left hand corner, it will highlight that the student is on their courses tab, they also have the option to click over to the to do list and this will show them anything past due at the beginning and then the next seven calendar days due from there. And I just wanted to remind as well as we're walking through here. Please do not hesitate to take off your microphone or talk in the chat and ask any questions as we're moving along in the platform. So these are all quick links for those students. They can click right into here and actually access that lesson. You'll notice that it's not showing the lesson for the student just because there's an activity due before this one and this one is just the getting started video. So we'll talk a little bit more into that in depth, but I'm gonna stay on the to do list for now. So these are all quick links. The student can work right from here. It will tell them the due date and most of the courses in epic are continuous courses, which means that the course will automatically pace out for the students giving them targeted due dates. So they're not hard set dates. These are just going to pace out depending when the student needs to end the course. By the last thing on the top, on these tabs that the student can click on is their activity stream. This is going to be a notification center for the students. So this is where they can come to see any feedback left by a teacher. If they have a new score updated, anything the student would need to be notified of as well. You can see click click links here. So any time you see a blue hyperlink as a student, you can click right in there and it'll either give you the feedback for the new score you earned. And then if I were to click on one of these titles that would bring me right into that lesson or quiz, I'm gonna click back over to my courses tab on the left hand side in order to navigate back to my courses. So this is exactly what it looks like, right? When they logged in, they'll always see the updated day and then the announcements to the right. So anytime a administrator at the top level, meaning lita or someone with an epic at a higher level has posted an announcement for everybody to see teachers and students. Or if you have as a teacher have posted an announcement, the student will be notified here and they'll be able to click and be able to see that announcement. It will notify them of who this came from. So my name in the site is Bright Thinker, but this would say the teacher's name who it was given to. So this is the course and then the date it was created and when it expires, you'll notice it automatically brought the student to the communication tab. This is something they can find in their hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. I'm gonna click back. We'll notice that it brought us right down to communication. I'm gonna click back into the home icon and how I got there was that announcements right from the home page. So speaking of that hamburger menu. We're actually gonna walk through there first. So I'm gonna click back up there in the top left hand corner and the first option down from the home icon is the grades for the student. So this is gonna be their overall grades. If they're enrolled in four courses, all four will populate here. They have that quick link to their course. They also have a heart icon. This allows the students to click and drag their understanding interest and effort levels to update their teacher on how they're feeling. And of course, there's four options within each bar and they can come in here and update this as much as they'd like. It will also list any teachers enrolled in the course and then they have two different progress bars when hovered over, it'll tell them the total number in each progress. This one has 43 on the right and this one has 37. The first one is just gradable activities. So anything included in the students final score, the other one is going to include any non gradable activities as well such as coloring pages, objectives, like getting started video, something that the student wouldn't require a grade for, but it's still an active activity they must mark as complete in order to finish the course. They can also view on the top left hand corner where it's highlighted as courses, any of their past courses. So I've been enrolled in quite a bit of past courses, but this is where I can come and see any scores. I previously earned my current status in that course. And then the progress and the time that I spent there, I click back over to the courses tab where the student would be and anytime they see this print icon, they have the ability to print this out. So it'll just give them that summary of the page that they're on. I'm gonna go back in the main menu and underneath here is the notes tab. So this is where students will hold such as a digital notebook. And any time they're in the lesson, they have an ability to take a permanent note where they can take notes on any of the content. They're learning to remind themselves of anything such as if they had a physical notebook in a in person class, just gives them the ability to come back here and have access to anything. They took notes while learning a lesson back in that main menu underneath the notes tab is the communication that's where we were brought earlier from the announcements notification. They can click through and see any announcements that has been posted by a teacher and or admin back in that main menu underneath the communication is gonna be the calendar again with those continuous courses, it will pace out for the student so they can come here and click anywhere they see the color coordinate dot with each course, anything due for that course, any blackout dates will also populate for the student and it will notify them that nothing is due on those days. So that's gonna be any holidays assessed by your administrators and already input into the main domain for you. But when the student is enrolled in multiple courses, they'll have different courses listed beneath with all of the different color dots for them. And these are also quick links. So if the student wanted to work right from their calendar, they could click right in here and begin working for the day. I'm gonna click back in the top left hand corner and down to student resources. This is the last option that a student has in their main menu. It's all of the frequently asked questions by students in the platform, especially if they're brand new to bright thinker all via video. But then at the very bottom, we also have a PDF option depending on the student's preference. Teachers and administrators also have this tab in their main menu. Should you need it? Um Just so you can help direct the students if they get a little lost in the platform. Lastly, underneath all of the main options, we then have a dark gray bar and all of the courses that the students enrolled in so that they can click right from here and begin working in their course. Should they want to from the main menu? I'm gonna use that home icon. And then that way we can look at what a course card is. So we call this rectangle of course card. It includes an image to coordinate with the course that the students enrolled in as well as the course title. And then these dates right here are gonna show unique to the student. The first and last day they can submit work in the course. Once they actually begin working, they'll have a current score populate here. And then the progress bar will actually also darken as they move along in the course. And then at the very bottom, we have a play button that will bring them right into the activities or the bar graph icon will bring them to their grades specific to this course. So we're gonna click on that play button and then the student will automatically see a few things here. So all of those same course details from the main page, but then to the right, they will be able to see their score right here once it populates, I haven't begun working. So I don't have one yet. The great icon again here. And then the eyeball feature allows the student to click and hide their score. So if they had a score previously right here, it'll just disappear as there's nothing there. It's not gonna change their grade in any way. It's actually just going to hide it from them if they're discouraged in any way or they just don't want to see their sport at this time. And then underneath they, they have a more in depth progress. So they're able to see by percentage and one hovered over the exact amount out of total that they have completed as far as activities in this course underneath, there is going to be the welcome page or the landing page. This is specific to each teacher. So once we switch over to the teacher, we'll show you how you can customize this. It's utilized in many different ways across the board. You can use this as a static announcement. You can include a Zoom link, any youtube videos, any text and images that you'd like to make unique to your course, just what you whatever you'd like the students to see as soon as they log into their course and then scrolling down, the student will then see the full entire course, all one through 10 units. If it's a core course under that activities page to the right. They have another quick snapshot of their to do list just for this course. And then they also have course links. These are all unique to this course as well. They can be included by the teacher as extra resources or anything you should want to show the student. When clicked on, it's just going to populate a new tab. We used our bright thinker site as an example. But again, you can use this for extra resources for math, reading anything you'd like, I'm gonna click back over to the activities and then the student can either start at the up next activity at the very top or they can open a unit folder and begin working at the first activity there. The getting started video is going to be in all of the courses for the student. It's just a quick walk through of the platform in case the student has never been a bright thinker before, they would click mark this activity as complete in the bottom left hand corner and then they would be able to move to the next activity by scrolling to the right hand side. Once here, this is actually going to show the next unit uh just a quick preview of what's coming up because we haven't yet begun working in this unit folder. So I'll click on that first activity. And in here, we've actually up included an upload example for fourth grade science. So this is a science journal activity requesting that the student create a cover page for their science journal and then a table of contents and all of the safety rules encompassing here. So as a student after I have finished my work, I have a couple different ways that I can upload in the platform. You can either click right into this text box and it will populate a ton of different options for the students. One being this picture icon that allows you to insert an image right from your device. So you can either click and drag an image right here. You can upload by URL or using this um camera icon. You can capture right from your device. If you have a webcam applicable, then the student also has the option to insert a video or audio. They can text right within the box, oops or they can use the plus button in the big blue circle in the bottom right hand corner allowing them to attach a file right from their device. So there's many different ways that the students can upload work. I'm gonna use your course list as an example and then I'll upload there. Once the student has uploaded, they can confirm before submitting their work that this is what they intended to upload. If they are not trying to submit this for their work, they clicked on the wrong activity, they can simply remove before they submit and select the correct image instead. But I like what I have. So I'm going to submit my work and then a few things will change for the student here. It's going to notify them. They have successfully submitted the assignment and the button now changes to resubmit my work into instead of submit. So is there a limit for the size of the file that they can upload? Um We, I would have to actually look into that. Lita let me take a note of that. We haven't run into any issues where students have tried to upload it too big of a file. Um I'm sure there is a limit but it's probably greater than anything a student would try to be submitting. That's a great question though. I'm gonna follow up on that just in case. All right. So that's how a student would submit work. And then if you scroll back just a little bit to the top, you can now see that the status has changed to completed slash submitted. And they'll see this little paper icon. Anytime a student sees this paper icon also in the top right hand corner in the platform, that means that there's either a portion of the activity or the entire activity requires something to be graded by the teacher. So they do not have the full grade yet. It's not an automatic submission by the platform. So they're waiting on a grade in here in order to move to the next activity, they can either use the toggle arrows in the top left hand corner or scroll to the bottom and use the next activity button in the bottom right hand corner from here. This is an example from first grade social studies. So it's gonna look a little bit different than those older grade levels for K through two, if we have any K through two teachers in here. Um This is just going to show you an overview how the difference the students have in that they'll learn just a little bit of the content and then answer those questions here instead of on the older grade levels, it's actually going to all encompass on one page and all of the content will be at the top and then they'll scroll to the bottom and review section in the bottom. So this was intended hopefully to hold that focus of the students as they're learning and cause less distractions instead of having it all on one page. And you will notice this is a good thing to take note of. Um these videos are not required to be watched. So if I was a student and I got to this last page and I decided I don't want to watch the video, I can click next um that they are able to watch that video if they would like none of the videos in Bright Finger are going to exceed three minutes. That is because they're intended to assist with learning but not teach the lessons themselves. So I'm gonna click next. Once the student hits this review page, they will see a check mark in the bottom right hand corner of each question, ensuring they have answered all of the questions, I'll click submit in the bottom right hand corner and then it'll give the student one last chance. So just make sure they don't wanna go back and check any questions before submitting, but I'm ok. So I'm gonna submit and then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, I automatically have earned a grade for this. That is because there was nothing open ended or essay, nothing to upload. So the teachers are not required to provide a grade before the student sees their answers or I'm sorry before they see their score. So if the student either can click jump to submission up here in the top left hand corner or they can scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll just bring them down here. There is a section called view grade details and this is where the student is able to see a quick snapshot of everything entitled in their course. So their score, the status is now completed, the targeted due date versus the date they submitted as well as the active amount of time they worked on that lesson before clicking submit. They can also then click over to the questions tab and the lower grade level students will have to click through in order to see their questions per number. Um But this is where they can come and see what they answered and the question score and you'll notice that this is actually exactly what an epic student sees um because I have changed all the settings to match. And so the student will see their answer and the score after the first submission, I'm gonna go back. They also have a submission history. It's just a quick snapshot for the student to be able to see if they submit again, then they'll see the second version here with the unique details of that second submission. So I'm gonna go back really quick since it's a first grade and resubmit my work so that you can see what happens after the second attempt. Um The students will always have this retake button available that to them for anything encompassing in the lessons category, which means lessons, activities, practice not included in the practice test, project skills and they have an unlimited number of attempts with epic. So they can click retake here in the bottom right hand corner and the activity will look as if this unit had never submitted. So they would go back through, provide a new answer or the same answer depending on their first round. And then oops, I missed a couple there. I think I skipped over number three. Yeah. All righty. And then once I click submit here, my new score will pop in the top right hand corner. So when I go down to my submission area and my view my grade details in the submission history, I can now see the 1st and 2nd version and the scores I earned the 1st and 2nd time. I'm gonna click back on the X air in the X in the top left hand corner. And then I'm gonna talk all to the next activity from here as the students are working in the platform. They also will have a couple different options to help assist as they're learning. So in the top right hand corner, you'll notice in the toolbar, we have a highlighter is the first option. Now, depending on which device you're on, it will allow you to either just drag over and that will highlight some devices require you to drag and click enter. Um So just be aware of that as students are working in the platform, the highlighter can be utilized in the content itself or in the review section. So this is a great example of how K through two is a little bit different than those older grade levels. This one came from an eighth grade course. So you'll notice how everything is on one page with the vocabulary at the top, the content itself and then the review section at the very bottom, they also have an eliminator to the right of the highlighter. This is going to give that visual process of elimination on multiple choice questions. So when hovering over, they'll see that little X and this will allow the student to visually cross out any answers, they are sure are wrong. The student accidentally clicks on one of the correct answers. No big deal at all. They can either just click that right back off or if they select that answer choice, it will take it off for them to the right of the answer eliminated. They will have the print feature. This is printing prior to submission. So they will be able to work on paper should they need to. Um but they would still be required to go back in and answer digitally on the platform to the right of the print feature. Then we have text to speech which will open up a full panel of options. So I'll go to the top so we can look at a couple of these options. You have the pointer finger which will allow the student to select where they would like the platform to begin reading. An assumption is a statement that is accepted. They also have the play button that will read from the very top of the um lesson itself and read up to 1000 words. They would then need to use the point your finger to continue. Should it exceed past those 1000 words past that we have the stop and pause button and then the translator. So this can do anything from a sentence to a word to a phrase to a paragraph. Um I'll just do one word here and then we can click the translator button up in the top right hand corner and this will translate the word for them. It looks like it's clicking on the wrong one. Let me try that again. So now let me check my settings really quick. Sorry about that. So mine's translating from English to Spanish. Let me try a fool. Freeze here. There we go. So it's gonna translate to the language specified in the settings which we'll get into in just a minute and it will read out for up to 18 of the most common languages. Some of them will only translate the text itself. I next to the translator is going to be a dictionary. So it will give a definition of a word or phrase highlighted. We then also have a picture icon to go along with all of the words in the platform. Next to that will be the screen mask, which is one of my personal favorites. This will allow the student to focus as they're reading through the platform. I used to do this with a bookmark on actual textbook. So it's nice to see this in a digital platform as well. And then last but not least we have the magnifier which coordinates with the pointer icon and will magnify the words as it reads to the students. Emotional appeals often use loaded language or last icon next to that is actually a highlighter. So very similar to the one that we have within the platform already. But this will actually give a couple different colors which is very useful in English or some of those higher level grade levels that need to annotate or use different colors. Um So you can just highlight over where you need to and click the color you'd like to use and then you'll notice the gear icon. This will allow you in the general settings to change the voice speed, the text highlighter color, the magnifier size as well as the speech mode. And then we have the translation button. This is where you can select which language it's translating from English to another language. And you'll notice this little um microphone or loud icon that just lets you know that it's actually going to speak that language to the student. Otherwise it will only translate the text to them. Then we also have screen tools. So if you'd like to change the reading light color, so this is just specifically for the reading mask, so I'll change it just so we can see what it looks like. And the student actually is able to open that screen mask and then change what it looks like. So they can decide actually that's not what I actually wanted there. Um And then they can do anything to their preference here and then should they not like anything, they can reset it back to the default. And we do have a PDF explaining everything that I just went through in detail. Should you need to share that with a student or go back and research your steps as you're walking through it on your own, any time you see the paper, airplane icon that's going to be communication form for the student. So as long as the teacher and the student both have an email within the platform, they will be able to send a message to this, the teacher keeping in mind this is going to go to every teacher enrolled in the platform. Um but they can ask a question right from here and it will send straight to the teacher's inbox of whatever email is specified in their profile last. But not least we have that notes icon, sticky note at the very top. Anytime you see it in the student tools that's gonna be a permanent note and it allows the student to take a note and it will save in that digital um notebook that we saw earlier in the notes tab of the main menu. So they can um either copy and paste into the platform of the notes or they can type right within here and then it'll time stamp it for them, tell them where it came from and then they can click right to their notes from here as well if they'd like to. But I'm gonna click through the questions at the bottom. Um Just so we can move on to the next activity and you can see what this looks like. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to take off your microphone or throw them in the chat. And Sophia will either answer them or let us know and we can talk through them as well. Can you delete um activities or lessons if you needed to? Absolutely. Sorry. Go ahead to modify for a student. Yes, absolutely. So we can go in a little bit in depth of it, specifically what Epic prefers as well. But once we get to the teacher's side, I'll show you the editor and you have freedom to hide activities. And so that will essentially excuse for all of the students that'll take it out of their preview. The only reason we recommend to not delete is just because especially if students had already begun working in the platform and it will delete all of the scores they previously earned. But that's a great question. All righty. So you all will notice um we had a few automatic grading options at the top of the activity. But then we also have some open end questions. We just wanted to put this in here so we can show you what it would look like for a student. So they will see that same icon indicating that something needs to be graded by a teacher and they will not be able to see a score until that is given by the teacher, but they can still see the review section. So everything they provided an answer for and then the text box at the very bottom um for the ones that had the and now last year lita I don't know if it's just on my side. I know you were asking a question but you were cutting out quite a bit. So I wasn't able to hear what it was. Yeah, there, there's some classes that have the guided notes, I can remember what they're called. Are they available this year or is that not till next year? Yes. So the accommodated courses are what you're referring to. I believe those are actually only going to have a reduced number of questions per ques quizzes practices and unit test. So they are available. Um Those are completely separate courses that would need to be added in. Um but they will be containing five questions across all quizzes and then 10 questions a across all practice and unit tests. Thank you, of course. All right. So at the sa the bottom, all those same options are gonna be here in order to view the grade details, see the targeted duty and when it was submitted and then they have that retake button available to them. I'm gonna click the next activity from here and this is actually going to be an example for once we get over to the teacher side. So I'm actually gonna skip this lesson and move on. I messed up. I forgot to allow myself to move on. So let me go ahead and submit this really quick and then I will be able to show you a quiz. All righty. So Epic does only allow two attempts per quiz for students. So it doesn't mean that the student can never take it past the two attempts. This is just prior to teacher intervention. So as a teacher, you'll always be able to go in and allow additional retries past those two attempts. But this is what the student will automatically receive. So when they click start, they will need to submit um require an answer per question and they will have to submit all at once. They don't have the ability to answer this question, leave and come back. Anytime a student leaves the assessment, they get kicked out via internet or issues or anything else that happens, the platform will. So let's say the student only answered this first question, the platform will submit for them, but it will never submit an answer for them. So it'll just all be marked blank. So they'll see the blank in the review section and then there'll be a um everything will be answered or marked as incorrect as far as the blank answers. So you'll be able to confirm, ok, there was probably an internet issue or they backed out of the quiz before they were done. The platform will never select an answer for the student. So I'll quickly go through and click so that you all can see the difference of what a student can see for the first admission versus the second. Um But as we'd asked earlier, there is something that we call an accommodated course offering this year. So it's brand new. Um And with those, all of the quizzes will only have five questions versus how you see here. This quiz has. I believe it's about 20 yeah, 20 questions So we're gonna click next. All of those are available. So I'm gonna click submit. So after I submit, there's no questions to display here. Um I got a 50% automatically and then I can view my grade details from here. I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. And then now everything that I have provided a submission for, I can see that green check mark indicating I've completed that activity, close that out and then this is just a full instructional unit so that you could see what it would look like outside of our examples. So this is third grade science unit two. It's gonna have about three lessons until it hits that first quiz. All of the activities, labs following pages will be sp sprinkled throughout the unit itself and then at the very bottom, they'll have a practice test and new unit test before they reach that next unit. Very similar. This is English one. Obviously, the grades are drastically different. Um But the flow of the course is about the same. So I'm gonna click back on my main menu in the top left hand corner. Now that I'm in a course, I have a different sub menu you'll notice. So I can click into my activities or grades from here because I'm already in this specific course. So the grades for each course, this is where a student can come see their overall score. There are different percentages for progress. And then if they scroll down to the bottom, they'll be able to see each line item submitted versus targeted due due date, the status and the score here. They also in the top left hand corner, have a dashboard, they can click on and then I'll just give a quick overview as well as the activity, which is a almost the far right, but about the middle and this will show the student exactly how long when they started working in each activity and then the total amount of time spent in this course, click back on that grades and then the main menu in the top left hand corner, they can either use these toggles, um icons in the top to navigate back to that regular menu or they can use that arrow to be able to see everything from here. So now that I took notes in that course, they populate here for me and I can actually click right back into the course I was working on. We use that main menu to go back to the student application. And then the last thing I'd like to show you on the student side is in the top right hand corner. The student's name will populate here again. Mine is just right thinker in the platform, they can click and get a couple of different options from here. Choose theme is gonna be the second one. This is where they can come and change their color theme. Now, of course, this can change at any time throughout the school year. If administrators at the top level of the domain decide they don't want students to do this, there's a couple of things they can turn on and off. Um But lady can correct me if I'm wrong. I believe the students currently have the ability to change the color and they also can choose their color scheme, meaning if they use the drop down option, they can change to a dark color scheme. So I'll do an obvious different color, like green and then the color will change everything such as their banners, their menu, anything that coordinates and then the dark color scheme have now changed everything that was once a light gray or a white color to a darker color. Um So this helps a lot with students that have headaches or issues with being on a computer for a long extended amount of time. Um But they definitely don't have to turn that on if they don't want to Megan walls just to show them how they share the calendar with their parents lito you're cutting out again for me how they view the calendar for their parents. Is that what you said? Well, I know that last year, the calendar Google calendar so their parents can see when things are due. Understood. Yes. So the students actually have the ability to go to their calendar. So I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner again down to the calendar icon and they will see these arrows in a circle and this allows them to sync and it will give them information on how to sync with their Google calendar. So it'll give all the due dates straight to their Google calendar. The only thing is they will not be able to click right from their Google calendar into the lesson. It doesn't um flow quite that well yet. Um But it will just show up the due dates in their Google calendar. So they're able to see it in both places. Um Teacher, I knew that this was really helpful. This would have been really helpful for my parents. I don't know what's due. I don't know when we was everybody able to hear lita on that one. No, I think you're sounds cutting out for everybody lita, but I was about to, I was able to piece it together. I think she was just intending that this is very useful for the students with Epic and the parents being able to see that calendar that the stu I guess, do the parents have access on their side to see their Google calendar maybe. And so it's a lot easier for them to be able to see that instead of having the students log in and showing them everywhere that everything's due. Yes. And you should be able to uh make that link of the calendar and the, that calendar in there. Um, as well. I lost little pieces, but I think I fully understand what you're saying. They're able to connect the calendars. So, yes, just that, those two arrows in a circle that allows them to see the options of how they'll sync those calendars. It's pretty easy. I've done it on my side. It gives you all the information right here and then they can connect those on their end. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you on the student application again where their name is in the top right hand corner, clicking down to see the first option is settings as a student. This will be all of the user details that were given to me once I was created as a user. But on the right hand side, I can put in any email or mobile number that I'd like with the coordinating carrier. So we see this a lot for parents and they can be notified of any of the following student notifications. So they would input their email and or mobile number, select their carrier and then come down here and they can choose either text or email depending on the notification. And then either daily or weekly of when the enrollment status changes, their grade drops below passing if they submitted an activity. Um someone replies to a discussion post. This is more in the high school level courses, not really in the younger grade. Levels. Um But if they're ever awarded a badge or they receive a score or feedback. So this is a great way to immediately connect with the parent's email and or number and just get notified of these few options here. And then the students also have the option to select from the avatar list. Should they want to pick an image for their profile and then they would just click save and refresh their browser to update anything that they had changed before we move on over to the teacher application? Did anybody have any questions of what we have covered or have not as far as the student application, you may have said this, but can they access um their activities from their calendar? Uh kind of like the to do list? Are they actually able to access from the calendar as well? Yes, absolutely. So if they select a day that actually has something to do with that color dot Anything they highlight over, they'll be able to click right in there and be able to work right from the calendar. And I will know um I don't have anything double due right now. But if they had multiple activities for one course, they would just have a little carrot button here and they would just click to expand and then they can click on each specific activity from there. OK. I have a, I have a question. Yes, ma'am. Um Is there like a standard or does it vary by grade level like this? Right. Thinker. Try to give students two activities a week per subject. Um, or does it just fluctuate depending on subject? And then, uh, the, the part where you showed where t where that you can sign up a parent's email address? J what's your, I'm sorry? Um, where you can set up the kid, the parents email address? Is that something that teachers can set up for them or would without having to log in through the parent portal? I mean, the student portal. Uh No, ma'am. So unfortunately, the notification settings will only be per user. So they would have to do that in their own settings per student. Um But they're very quick to access. So as soon as the student logs in, they can just click right from their name to the settings and then it's all right here for them. I was wondering if there was a way to lock that once you put in a email or a phone number. So the student couldn't go in and remove it. There's not. So it gives w freedom just for the ability. Should they put the wrong one in or they need to update it? It's there for them. Um But then back to your first question, Nadia, uh as far as pacing for the students, um can I ask which grade level you're teaching? Uh all, all grades? Sure. That's usually the answer for epic teachers. I just wanted to ask. Um Just because as of actually today, um the K through two courses have been given, let me go in here and find it so we can look at the same time. So if you're teaching K through two in the activities as a teacher, you'll see this course resource folder at the very top, you'll notice it's automatically hidden from the students. Should you want to show anything to the students you'll need to go in and allow students to see that. Um But within here, they have given an optional pacing guide. So this will help assist walking through the platform and knowing when things should be due. Um This is just kind of a basis should you need it? But if you're using a continuous course, it will pace out for the student. So with the continuous course, it's unique to each student. Of course, if one student starts in August and another student starts in September and they're still gonna take the entire course, they're gonna have a few more things due. Um But it really depends usually with the grades three through 12, it seems to be about one activity per day. But again, it's really dependent on the subject matter and what needs to be completed and things like that. Is it easy to modify those assignments for our fed kids? Like reduce questions or reduce answer choices? Yes, absolutely. So not on the teacher end and it might depend on what your uh um abilities within the administrator application are. So we'll look at those together once we switch over to the teacher side. Um but there's four accommodations that an administrator can set to each user. So with that, let me go over here. So when you have access to the users tab at the very bottom of the details, this is the four accommodations that can be set per user and this is across all of their courses. So never automatically assign zeros that's not going to be on anything by default. That's if a teacher goes into their course and decides they want to automatically assign zeros after past due activities, this student wouldn't be affected. You can also ignore any time limits on assessments. Should there be any also always allow speech stream that has been turned on across the board for epic? But should a teacher want to turn it off per course or per activity, then the student will still have access and then you can also limit the number of options on multiple choice questions. So if I put two here, then this student would only ever see two options across all multiple choice questions. But the another option that just became new available this year is those accommodated courses which will reduce those number of questions across all quizzes and practice tests and unit tests for students. Ok. This, that's fantastic. Um Can you just tell me one more time how you got here. And so this is just, you're just modifying this for Aaron Sullivan, right? So if I had 2/5 graders, one could have these accommodations and the other could go without them. Correct. Yes, ma'am. These are unique to each user. Um I didn't explain how I got here just because I wanted to make sure with lita that y'all had the ability to do this or is this something that you'll have to request by? Epic? Y'all do have specific teacher admin level permissions. Um But just because the school year ended, I wasn't ab actually able to see exactly what y'all have permissions on. Um And with, I'm not able to share my screen right now and show just because I would be showing student data if I were to go into y'all's actual site. So in your administrative settings, if you have the ability, you would just access. Um So right when you log in, you get the option of an admin or a teacher. If you accidentally click on teacher or you're already working in the teacher platform, you can use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner and that will allow you to switch over from admin to teacher if you're enrolled in as a student, that's how you'd switch to a student as well. So you'll want to be in the admin app and then you'll use that main menu and click down to the users tab and these are all fake students. I'm still in the training site. Um But you would click on the user id of your student and then scroll to the bottom and it's all right there for you. The only reason I say this is, I believe the last time that this was asked, y'all didn't have access to it so you can view it when it's here, but everything is grayed out. I don't know if that's been changed or not or if you all have access to it, but if you don't and it's all grayed out, you would just request that from Lida and, or another administrator. It's not lita um and they can come in here and add these accommodations per user for you. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I'm gonna switch back to the student app really quick. Did anyone else have any remaining questions before we switched over to the teacher's side? Megan? I wanted to mention, did you want to show the calendar how they can filter per day, week and month? Absolutely. That's a great one, Sophia. So I'm gonna go back to the calendar icon. Uh I'm sorry, calendar tab in the main menu. Um What Sophia was referring to is that if a student was on a specific day. So right now it's just gonna show the day that I'm clicking on. But if I come up here in the right hand corner where it labels the day, I can switch down to a week. So then if I'm just on this week, it'll still show me that Friday due date. If I click into this week, it'll show me everything due for this week or I can even show myself an entire month. That way the student doesn't have to be on the day and click into each day in order to see everything. Do. Thank you, Sophia. Of course, we have one more question from Andrea. Can we omit an activity for specific students and keep it for others? Yes, absolutely. So we'll just go ahead and switch over to the teacher side. A lot of the questions I think y'all are asking even prior to the training were in regards to the editor. So we'll go in there and look in that and then you all can see all of the different options of what you have for students. I'm gonna flick right back really quick. Is this where you were looking? Sophia was on the Yes and the chat. OK, perfect. I just wanted to make sure there was no questions in regards to the student application before I moved on student application looks good. All right. So again, in order to switch over to a different permission set from admin teacher student, you would use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner next to your name and then click over to switch. Um I forgot that I didn't enroll myself as a teacher So I'm actually going to log in as a teacher that I enrolled in the course. So one second, early credit. 223. Ok. All right. So this is very similar to what yours should look like. You should have admin or teacher. I'm gonna click into the teacher side and you'll notice everything looks very similar on the teacher's application that's intended so that if the students ever get lost or you need help with anything, nothing looks foreign to you. Everything is the same across the board, especially when you switch over to the administrative application as well. So I know that y'all had a lot of questions in the editor in order to get there. I'm gonna cover a couple of steps first. I just wanna make sure y'all didn't think I was forgetting about you. Um But right when you log in as a teacher, you'll still have that date here. And then um what's really great about this platform is that you'll have the needs grading right on your home page for you. So you'll have a notification of how many you have left to grade. You'll notice it's a three. Even if I click in here, I don't provide a grade for anything and I click right back out. That three is gonna remain there for me until I provide a grade for each of those three submissions. That way you don't ever have to get confused if you graded something or not it's always gonna remind you right here. You also have that announcements tab as a teacher that'll bring you to communication tab where you'll notice that there's any new announcements provided by an admin or you or another teacher created a new announcement. Um Only the teachers that are enrolled in the same courses of you that will is what you'll be notified of. So you won't be notified of other teachers that aren't in your courses. So I'm gonna click on that needs grading tab. And on the left hand side, you'll be able to see the three submissions here. And I wanted to show you the difference between these. So the first one is that first upload, I uploaded. If you remember where we showed the difference between the text or if you could use right from your device or use the upload and I chose the upload. So this is what you see as a teacher, you'll see the student's name, the course it came from, the activity is actually a hyperlink so that you'll be able to click right in there and see what the students saw as they were submitting. And then you'll also have the targeted versus submitted date scrolling down. You'll be able to see the student attachments and it keeps it all in one clean box for you. And then at the very bottom, anytime you see comments with a gray box, this is what the student also provided in the text box and then at the very bottom is a rubric provided for you. So you can actually typewrite within here grading per um section. And then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, it automatically calculates for me on the activity itself, you'll notice it's highlighted on content, clicking over to score and activity history is where I can see how many times the student submitted or I'm sorry, this is actually how many times the student visited the activity with a time stamp. But then the submission history is where you'll see that how many times they actually submitted the activity. And then all the way over to the right is class statistics. This is only applicable when more than one student has submitted and when it's in has a portion of automatic grading. So we'll look at one of those in a little bit. Um But all the way over to the right, this is where you can provide a score for the student. So I actually use the rubrics at the bottom and I'd like to keep my score. So I'm just gonna click submit score and then in the on the right hand side, you'll notice that that score populates for the student. So a seven out of eight was an 87.5%. Now, if I use this refresh in the top right hand corner, that'll refresh my list and anything that I've already graded will take out for me. So it can clear up some of that clutter. But let's say that it didn't have a rubric. So any, this is a great example of anything that's open ended, including with some of the automatic grading. So if I scroll throughout here, I can see what the student answered and what they got correct based on those automatic grading questions. But then anything that I need to grade will come to the top. So I can either use those points section where I can provide a grade and it will automatically calculate the rest of the score for me based on what the student answered or I can use this section in the top right hand corner. I can allow full credit which will give 100%. Keeping in mind it's not 100% just for these two questions. I need to grade. It's for the whole activity. So it's superseding anything they already provided as a grade. You can also allow no credit or clear out the score. You can revert to calculated, which is gonna give me that calculated score based on what they earned. You can also excuse which will take this out of the final scoring for the student's grade. They'll no longer be required to have this a part of their grade. It will excuse in the grade book and then they will no longer see it on their side. You can allow a retry again. This is only necessary should they exceed their amount that they had. So for lessons, quizzes, practices and unit test, there's a different amount that they have, but the lessons are unlimited. So you'll never need a quick allow retry for unlimited. But for the quizzes, they have two. So if they need that third additional retry, you can provide that here. You'll also then have the option to override complete. This will accept that failing score in the grade book. Should there be a reason that the student is not allowed to move forward with Epic? They should be able to move forward within the platform regardless. Um But should you ever run into that issue? You can always click override complete and then that will allow them to move on. And then at the very bottom in the right hand panel, you'll see that very familiar text box where you can insert an image video or audio as well as any emojis or text. And this will leave feedback to the t to the student and they'll see that in their notification center. So I'll click submit score and then again, I'll see that score provided and you'll also see that text box icon, the click down to my last submission. And so this is where you'll see an example. If the student just types a period or a dot exclamation point and clicks enter, you'll see that in the comments. So the comments is anything that the student has provided as an answer, you'll be able to click over to the score and activity history as well as the submission again. And then all the way over to the right underneath the feedback box, you also have the option to edit templates. So this is templates for feedback, if you click edit, that will allow you to create a template. So I'm gonna make this one for if the student did a great job in here and then you'll click done and now you have that template. So when I exit back out, instead of having to type into each students, the same feedback, I can just click right on that template and submit a score. So you'll notice you can't leave feedback unless you've also provided a score and that will populate once you provide a score at the top and then at the very bottom underneath templates, you also have returned attachments. So if you need to upload a file to attach with their feedback to the student, you can do that here as well as create a private note for yourself. So it'll remind you it is that it is hidden from the student. Should you need to remind yourself of anything here? And then you would just click submit score and again, that student would earn their score. Does anyone have any questions in regards to providing a grade for anything uploaded or um provided by the student? I had a really quick question. It was on the lesson just previous to this one that you um are showing, I think you um how to say it, but the questions weren't in order like the ones that you had to actually gray rather than multiple choice. Um You were able to pull those to the top. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So let me go back and then can you share that again? Yes. So it's gonna look a little bit different since I already submitted the score. But anytime you see something in the needs grading tab and the students have a combination where something is automatically graded by the platform, let's say eight out of the 10 questions. But then those two questions required, a teacher answer those two will always come back to the top. Ok? So they'll always ok. All right. Very good. So anytime you're in that needs grading tab, these two questions will be at the top for you. So you don't have to go search through the questions to find out which ones they'll be. Ok. Thank you. I was thinking that that was the setting of some type but ok. Very good. No, it makes it easy for you. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. So back in the teacher app, we were in that needs grading tab. I graded everything so you can use that main menu and you'll notice that it brings you down to the Needs grading. It's just another way to get there, but I'm gonna click on the home icon to get back to the main page next to the needs. Grading to the right is the announcements tab. This is where you can come as a teacher, you'll notice it brings you straight to the communication again. It's just that quick link from your home page. So you don't have to go to the main menu. Should you not want to? Um But in the top right hand corner, you'll have this speech bubble. So it has three lines and when hovered over it says new announcement, I just zoomed in. So I'm gonna go back out a little bit so it looks normal. Um But you'll click on that new announcement and this is where you can choose. So I'm only enrolled as a teacher in one course. But if you're enrolled in more than one, which I'm sure you are, you'll have all of your courses listed here and then you can check on the check boxes for which courses you'd like this announcement to be. So you can do it for one course, for five, for 10, for all three. It just depends on what you'd like and then you'll have a start and end date or you can display it indefinitely. So you forever and then you can, it does require a subject and then that same text box. So you can include any images that you have a youtube video, any text or emoji emojis here and then you can even edit the text if you'd like, make it bigger, change the color and then you would click post in the top right hand corner and then you'll notice because I created this announcement, I can edit this announcement or delete it because these announcements were not my own. I don't have the ability to edit or delete them, but you can also always click through here and edit any ones that you've created at any time or delete them. And then you'll also notice in the top right hand corner you have that paper icon. I heard a little noise. I wanted to make sure that wasn't anybody asking a question. I don't know if it's just me hearing the noises or not, but I don't usually work with Zoom. So I'm not sure if that's like someone raising their hand or asking a question. But let me know on my side. So I think you think Sophia, I was just hearing like little bells. I don't know. OK. But anyways, so there's that little paper airplane that allows you to send mail to your students. Or if you scroll, you can select a specific student enrolled in that course. Again, the student and yourself would need to have an email in your details page of your profile, not the notification that's separate. And then um you would need to re it requires a subject and then you can send a copy to yourself as well if you'd like. And this will send straight to the students email inbox. And then I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner to go back to my home icon again. So those were all the quick links right from your page. And then as a teacher in the top right hand corner, you have managed courses which is a little double sheet of paper. And the first drop down option is to order your courses. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course, but the more courses you have, they'll populate here and you can click and drag and reorder the courses so that you can select which courses populate at the top for you. So if you have a, let's say English courses that you need to provide more grades in or some other courses that you need to be more active in, you can bring them all to the top because I know y'all are enrolled in quite a bit of courses sometimes and then scrolling through here could be time consuming. So you can order those forces from that first icon in the top right hand corner. You can also view past courses from here at the very bottom. Should you ever need to? So you still have all the same icons and you can click right into that course and view anything you need. And then lastly, you also have the ability to view slash delete courses. Um So again, we highly highly recommend never deleting anything in brighter because you never know if that's gonna delete all the scores, the grade book, anything that you need in there. Um But this is where you can just hide the course from your title. So let's say that you're still enrolled for another month, but that was little excessive for you. You didn't need it for another month and you just don't no longer want it on your page. You can just hide that from yourself. And then when you go to your home page, it's just no longer showing for you. So let's say you had 10 horses and you wanna hide five of them from yourself so that they're no longer cluttering your page. You can do that and you can always come back and unhide it from yourself as well. All the way over to the right where your name is as a teacher, you can click down and you'll have the same settings. So you also have a notification preferences very similar to the student email and or mobile number, but then you would scroll to your teacher notifications and you have the options to be notified of when a student submits something. So this is actually gonna be when a student submits anything. So it's not just any open ended or essay that require you to grade. We have put that as feedback to buzz, which is our learning management system we use um that holds the bright thinker content, but we've requested that, that be separated. So that's an option. But as of right now, this is just any time a student submits something. So now that um if a student submits an automatically graded assignment, you'll still be notified of that. Just keeping that in mind and then anytime a student's grade drops be passing or if a student's enrollment status changes. So with those three options, we highly recommend to either use email or if you specifically have T Mobile, then it's ok. But some of the other carriers, we've gotten feedback like cricket or I can't think of the other one. So via chime in if you can, but those actually notify you with separate text messages. So every single time that it's submitted, you'll get a new number, texting you. So your inbox will be full and it's just not the best sometimes. But with T Mobile, we've heard feedback and with emails, it'll all come as one text message. So uh for lack of better terms, it's one number that it comes from. So you get separate texts within one number, but you won't be bombarded with 500 different threads of texts. Um Outside of that, you also have the option to upload an image. So the students don't have this option in their avatar, you can click the plus button and choose a picture right from your profile, right from your device. So you can choose a personal picture of yourself or a picture of your dog, anything you wanna include, um, or you can choose an avatar just as the students do and then anytime you change anything in your settings, you'll wanna click save and refresh to allow those to take place. And then that'll bring you back to your main page in your main window. As a teacher in the top left hand corner, you'll have that needs grading tab, same exact from the one on the main page. You'll also have notes as a teacher very similar to the students. If you take notes in the lessons or anytime you see that notes icon, you can come back here for reference. Underneath. There is a communication that is where we were brought earlier with the announcements. It's the same page and then the calendar as a teacher also shows you anything that's due. Please keep in mind this will not be identical to the student unless your enrollment dates are identical in a continuous course. Meaning if a student isn't enrolled until August, but you have early access in July, your due dates will not line up with the students. It's gonna take your starting in date and line everything out then and again, that's only for a continuous course. So if you have a range course and you are set to set the due dates, then those will be identical to the students. Um But outside of that, everything is very similar, they are quick links, you can go to as a teacher and then you can switch between day, week and month back underneath the main page. You have a new tab that the students do not, which is the people tab. So this is going to show everyone enrolled in every single course that you have. So this will give a quick snapshot of everyone that you have access to as a student in the top right hand corner. The gear icon is where I recommend you go first. This will allow you to select what you view in the people tab. I like to turn everything on and then I click save and it's gonna give you quite a bit of options. So if you don't need everything in here, that's totally fine. You can click it off. Um But I just wanna show you all of the options that you have. So the first is the co I'm sorry. Could you, could you show me again how you got to that last screen? Yes. So I'll go back a couple of steps just in case anybody else is a little bit confused on how I got here in the main menu. In the top left hand corner, I navigated down to the people tab and then in the people tab all the way over to the right. The gear icon is how I selected what I wanted on in this page and then you click save and everything has been turned on here. So the first icon is the accommodations. Um So those ones we just spoke on earlier as far as um speech stream being turned on all the time limiting the number of questions per multiple choice um across the board for the students, all four of those are going to show the teacher right here. So I don't have any um accommodations as far as this user. So I'm actually gonna go in and turn an accommodation on really quick so we can see what that looks like. I'll turn them all on. Ok. So now that I have an accommodation set for this user as a teacher, I can click in the people tab and be able to see what those accommodations are. So accommodations for this student and then they have everything turned on and then they'll just give you notifications of those. Um And then Sophia did update me via lita since her microphone is not working, all epic courses are continuous. So I will continue the training with just speaking on continuous courses to not confuse you. So sorry about that before, but everything will be automatically paced out for the students. So based on their enrollment start and end date, everything will pay for them. So that is true. If you're given early access as a teacher and you don't have the exact enrollment dates as a student, it'll be a little bit different in the calendar just keeping that in mind. Um But next to the accommodations you can see the overall score the student has and let's say this right. Thinker student was enrolled in four different courses. They will actually populate four different times and the course that you're looking at will be listed right underneath their name. So for this specific course, this is their score and amount of time they spent there, I can see their understanding, interest and effort level. If they completed their heart, heart icon and the date it was changed and then scrolling over, I can see the progress and mastery. The online indicator is my personal favorite. This will show me any time a student is logged in at the exact same time as me. And then you also have the pace and performance indicated by a green yellow or red dot So this student's pace is on schedule, but their performance is currently failing in the courses. And then you can see any badges and anything that any badges they earned, anything today that they submitted any failed assignments or late as well and then the end date for this student. So this is the quickest way to come and see. The last date that the student has to submit is December 28th 2022 for this course and then back up in the left hand corner to the main menu underneath the people. Tab is our customer support link. So this is where you can come and click. This will bring you right to a new tab and this is where you can either provide feedback, report, an issue or a bug or submit a help ticket. Um So we actually also have access to your Epic quick start guide, which I'm gonna open really quickly, which has been beautifully updated by LITA. Um But everything in here is specific to Epic and bright thinker. So any questions that you may have, it can easily be found in here and you can click control, find and just type in anything that you need to find and it will update here for you. I'm not saying that we are not here to help you with any additional questions. It's just a quick guide to help you. Should you need it. And I'm sure Leah can provide that link if anybody doesn't have it. And then back in the main menu underneath the customer support tab, we're actually gonna skip over clipboard for today. It's a little bit more advanced. Um but I'm gonna click on the more reports option. So this will allow you to pull a PDF version of any of these reports. So we have a student daily activity of progress and a grade details. So I'll show you an example of what that looks like the student daily Activity report. It's gonna show you time stamps of everywhere. The student was logged into the platform and how long and then the grade details report will give you a quick overview of the course that the students in. So a course grade their progress and then all of the grades that they have earned thus far. And again, those can be found in your more reports. Tab lastly, you have access to that student resources identical to the students on their side. Should you need it? And then your any courses you're enrolled in will populate in the bottom left hand corner as well with a color co ordination. I'm gonna click back on the home icon and now we're gonna focus on the course card. So yours similar to the student, but you have extra access. So you'll still have a course card with the image coordinating to each course, the course title as well. And then you have the activities icon, your grade book, the reports for each course, which is different from the more reports tab. You also have the people tab from here, which is a more in depth look of the people tab. So the one from your main menu is gonna encompass all of the students. This one is just for this course and then you also have the editor. So I'm gonna click on the play button first is very similar to the student. This is where you come and you can use the pencil icon to edit the landing page. So you can put anything you want here, you can change this daily, weekly, monthly, leave it the entire year, whatever is best for you and then scrolling down, you'll be able to access the activities just as a student does. So for example, if you wanted to come in here and view this eighth grade language, arts activity, you can see it exactly as the students see it. But even further in the top right hand corner, you can see that you're viewing ads yourself if you click here and the first drop down is view ads. This allows you to select a specific student. So I know that my student has already completed it. I'm gonna select, ok. Now I can see the score, they see I can go down to their submission. I'm able to see exactly what they have submitted. I can see that they have a retake available to them and I can even view their grade details as well. So this is the quickest way you'll be able to confirm a few different things without having to log in with credentials of a student or ask them on their end. You'll be able to just see right from here. I'm gonna use the back arrow in the top left hand corner to be brought back to the main page. And then this is just where you'll come. If you wanna do anything in the course such as the students, I'm gonna use the main menu in the top left hand corner. And now that I have selected this specific course, you'll notice my menu changed again. So this is the sub menu just for this course, the same icons we saw on the course card on the main page. So I'm gonna click down to the grade book. There's a couple cool features in here in the top right hand corner, you have a gear similar to how you have in the people tab. This is where you can select what you'd like to see in your grade book so you can choose user name. The last time the students logged in minutes spent in the course accommodations, um any progress or enrollment status and then any footers that you want. So if there's missing or low scores, anything like that and then at the very bottom, you'll have a box titled tools. This will allow you to export to a different course. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course. It's not gonna show me any other courses, but you'll have a list of other courses with check boxes and you can export the same settings you just chose here to all of your other courses. So you don't have to click into the grade book settings for each of your courses and change all of the settings. It'll just across the board, change for you. And then anytime you make changes, you wanna click save here and everything will apply. So I see that same accommodations flag I saw in the people tab, you can click there and view what those accommodations that student has their score per activity. And then in the top right hand corner next to the gear icon, once to the right is your lightning bolt which enables quick editing. This allows you to click any cell in the grade book, whether it has already earned a score been provided by you or is blank and you can enter in a score right from here. So you type in the score and click enter, you also can enter in an X and that will automatically excuse the assignment. So when someone asked earlier, if you can excuse an assignment for one student, but not all of the everyone in the course, this will be the quickest way, especially if you only have a couple assignments that you're trying to excuse for the student. This will allow you to go in and excuse and then you'll wanna make sure to turn that lightning bolt off so that you can go back in and not be affecting the score. Should you not want to anymore? Next to the lightning bolt is a tool. Um A wrench icon when clicked on this will allow you to export your scores. Should you need them in a CS V file? So it's just an Excel spreadsheet. I'll go ahead and export it so we can see what it looks like. Should you need the scores externally? It'll just show you that quickly for you outside of here. I'm gonna click and back into the grade book. So this is where you can do a couple different things. If you click into any scores already earned, this will show you the same tab as the needs grading tab we saw earlier. So you can come and adjust grades as you had before. You can edit your templates and then you can view with the submission history and the score activity from here if it is something that was automatically graded, so I'll go into the quiz, you'll be able to see all the answers. So you had not provided a score for this. This is automatically graded. Um but you do have the ability to change the score. So should, for whatever reason you decide that this student should earn court points for the justice question. You can go in and adjust the points for that question. It'll automatically update the score and you will need to click submit if you wanna save that score and then you'll notice the updates already for you. Another really cool thing in the grade book is if you click on the actual title of each of the activities on the click on quiz two, this will bring me into the stats. So if I had multiple students, it would list them all here the last time they logged in their status and score. But if I click over to analytics on the top, right, then I can scroll and see how the students answered. So again, I only have one student in here. But this will give me class statistics, 100% of this class answered the question wrong. This is the correct answer and so on, you can see 100% answered correctly. So if I decide that the students were not fairly questioned on this quiz, and I want to remove the question from score, I can do that here. And that will automatically give scoring back to each of the students that got the answer incorrect. So then if I use the back arrow, we can see the student did get that question incorrect. So now their score went up even higher automatically without me having to do anything else. Does anyone have any questions in regards to the grade book, how to change anything, anything like that? Perfect. So I'm gonna click back on the main menu in the top left hand corner underneath the grade book is the reports tab. These are all per course and will pull as a CS V file. So none of these are gonna be the PDF that would be in the more reports on the main menu. Um but this will allow you to pull a, a report on the grade book or the student in regards to performance on all of their courses or just in specific courses. Um Should you need any reports externally and then back in the menu menu underneath the reports is again another people tab, but this one is unique to this course. So it's only going to show you the students enrolled in this course and you'll notice I don't have all the options again just because it's a completely different people tab. I would need to go into that gear icon in the top right hand corner and select what I'd like to see on this people tab. But in the main menu, the last option when in a course is the editor. So this is how you're gonna come and see a lot of different things for bright thinker in the bottom left hand corner, you'll see a carrot right here to expand the left panel right now. I'm just in a course for actually, I have a meeting. But let me go back out, I'm just in a demo. So I actually don't have any standards aligned, but I'm gonna go into an Oklahoma course. So you can see what that would look like. So let's just pull up fourth grade El A. So when you're in the editor, let's say this is your actual course. You'll use that expansion arrow and then all of the standards that align with fourth grade El A for Oklahoma will be right here. But then when you open each unit, you'll be able to see what is covered for activity. So thats gonna be how you view standards within the course itself again in the editor and then you just expand on the left hand side to view, but I'm gonna go back really quick to the Doma demo. And then within each course, when you want to view something in the activity list, you'll need to open that unit folder with the carrot button and then that's how you'll see those activities in order to view correct questions. There's two ways you can do that in writing, thinker. So with any activities that have automatic grading like this, 4th, 8th grade, El A, I'm gonna use that pencil icon all the way to the right. And that will allow me to access all of the details and I'll click over to the questions tab and these are all the correct answers. Another way to view the correct answers on the exit out of here is it will be listed right beneath it. So if it's an upload, that isn't unique to a student answer, it's not gonna have 100 different possibilities of an answer. For example, math, it'll just have one or two. depending on the content, you will have an answer key listed right below. You can see this in the activities page as well actually. Um But when you're in the editor, you will go all the way over to the right using that triple dots and click preview. And this will allow you to preview the correct answer sheet for that activity. So this is an example of an activity, the student would upload work. There's only one possible right answer. So you'll have that answer key. When grading, I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. So again, the two different ways is either if it's already automatically graded and it has the answers in the platform, you use that pencil icon to go to the questions tab or if it has the answer key right beneath it, you'll use the triple dots all the way over to the right and preview underneath there. So all the way over to the right, you have three different icons. The first is an eyeball. So this will automatically excuse that assignment for everyone enrolled in the course. So let's say you wanted to hide the entire unit, the unit is closed here. So then I could just click the eyeball. And when I spanned the unit, everything within the unit is going to be hidden from the students. If you uncheck that eyeball, everything is then revealed again. So the benefit of the eyeball is if half the students have worked in there and half have not, if you hide the activity, everything will be taken out of the grade book, the students will no longer be able to see it, they'll not be required to work. But if you reveal it at any point, then all of those scores are able to come back. So that's why we recommend using the eyeball instead of deleting because it's kind of a safety net for you. But then you can also hide just the lessons within here or you can hide just one quiz. Um But keeping in mind any of the eyeballs here will hide from everyone in the enrolled in the course. So all students then next to the eyeball icon is that pencil editor outside of the questions tab, this is where you can see the settings. So all the settings across the board have been set for Epic. Um These are not Epic settings, these are just my demo course settings. Um But the number of temps is already there for you. Everything across the board has been submits this activity. I know last year there were some issues. If you're a returning teacher that students weren't able to move forward, it was making you grade things, we've changed that across the board. So students should be able to submit and move forward regardless of the score they received regardless if there's anything to grade or not. Um And then the passing score has been set to 60 as well. So everything can be found in that pencil icon to the right of the eyeball and then all the way over to the right of there is the triple dots. This will allow you to preview the activity. You can also move up or down or to a different unit. Should you need to, you can duplicate the activity as well or you can copy it to your library. So when you click copy to my library on the right hand side. If this isn't already expanded, you'll have another Carrot here to expand and the icon all the way over to the right is my library and you'll notice that copied in right here. The benefit is that we'll stay with you as a user. So if you would want to use this in a different course, at any point in time, you'll always have that activity with you, especially if you customize it from scratch or you need a completely different activity, you can copy it to your library and then that allows you to click and drag anywhere you'd like to have it. Um I have a quick question. Um And I'm sure you, you probably already said this. So I apologize but um when you click the pencil and then you can edit those settings and you can edit like how many attempts and stuff. What um this is all standard. So like is our default gonna be that they'll have two attempts. Um So let me go in. It is going to be the default for you, but the ones that we were looking at were not already epic settings. These are though. So let me go in here. So actually for lessons, the students have unlimited attempts for epic. But yes, this is where you would go to see the default settings that were already set um And or change them. Should you need to? Ok. So we're giving students unlimited attempts on assignments on lessons category. Yes, on the lessons. Ok, thanks. Yep. And then um further in there with that epic quick start guide again, if you do not have access to it, I'm sure lita already put the link in the chat. Um But at the very bottom is where all the settings are. So if you wanted to come and, and I think these are already updated. Yes. So they said changing to 60% for the school year. Um But everything in here is the settings that have already been applied by default to your courses. So that's at the very bottom of the quick start guide. Ok. And where is the quick start guide? One more time? I'm gonna a bookmark it. That's OK. I actually don't have the link to provide but lita if you don't mind putting that in the chat, I think she already did. Yeah. So if you see the chat of the zoom that we're in. Lita provided it in there, I also included it on the epic one bright thinker channel. Perfect. Thank you Lida. OK. So let me exit back out of there. Um So that is how you can move things around from the far, right, the triple dots, you're able to move things around copper library. Again, we highly recommend delete, not deleting, not to know. Um But you can also click and drag. So let me open a full instructional unit so we can see um keeping in mind if I click and drag this qui quiz two to be before quiz one, everything is meant to be in sequential order for bright thinker. So everything in quiz two encompasses less than 45 and six or whatever was prior to it. So if I go down here less quiz three is in company encompassing 78 and nine. So if I move it before those, the students are gonna be quizzed on things they might not have ever seen. So just keep that in mind when you're moving things around and editing and adding in your own things. Um and then at the very bottom left hand corner, the add activity. So it's kind of hard to see. Um but it's the very last option on your syllabus, you can click add activity and then anything in the first 3rd and 4th quadrants. So the L shape at the bottom will be blank. So you can add in an assessment and activity file attachment, youtube video and it will not contain anything in regards to bright thinker. So that's how you can um customize your own activities, add in flash cards, a journal, anything you like here. But then in the top right hand corner where it says library, you will be able to access your master courses. So you'll click open on that file. It'll take a minute because it's actually opening every single course that bright thinker offers. So let's say you are teaching fourth grade science and you want to supplement some third grade science and you can open this uh course, you can open any of the units that you wanna view and you can even preview the lesson before adding it in. So you'll scroll through, make sure this is the lesson you wanna add in. Then you'll click add to cart. It's not gonna cost any money. It's just the titling system they used. You'll have to click the cart button in the top right hand corner and then you'll always wanna click link. The difference is that link will link it back to the master so that any updates we make, it'll still come through to yours. All of the images will come through and all of the video as well as well. Um And the way that you can ensure that it was actually linked in is you'll see that little link icon. So actually all of these have it because I linked them in versus if it was already in your course, it does not have that little link icon thing. Um But then that will come in and you can click and drag that wherever you should need it. And then let's say you already have a lesson to. You'll wanna click on the pencil icon and you can change the title and then it'll look as if it was always there for the student. The only thing indication that it has come from a different grade level is state specific courses. Oklahoma. Third grade history, it'll actually show that it says third grade history in the lesson itself. That's something that can't be changed. Um And then all of the K through two courses have little videos throughout and they actually have a title with the grade level in there. But other than that, the title of the actual lesson um within the lesson itself for third through fifth grade outside of Oklahoma, it's not going to tell them that this came from a lower grade level or a higher grade level, whatever you're going from, I'm gonna click back out of here. So that is pretty much everything within the editor syllabus section. But then you'll notice in the top there's a couple different tabs. So I'm gonna click over to weights. This is where you can view the category weights. So again, I'm gonna use actually a different course, for example, because mine's not a great one. Um But you'll be able to see how the course is waited. So you have lessons, quizzes, practice as a unit test and then you'll even be able to open those and see what is encompassing between those. So you can ensure that you know that that lesson is 25% of their overall grade versus this unit test is 50. Um These are not epic settings. These are my demo ones. Again, let me go and see what epics are. Oh, actually they are. Yep. Epic uses the same one. So it's 2525 0 50 for lessons, quizzes, practices and human tests. And then next to that, we have the activity list. So this is within the editor. Let me close. I'm actually gonna get out of here. So I don't actually change anything in our master. Um But in the activity list, this is where you can come and filter so you can type in quiz. Um You can type in lesson anything you want to change all at one time. Um And just keeping in mind that when you type in lesson, that's also gonna populate the answer key and things like that. So just be aware of what's populating on that list, but I'll do a quiz for an easy example and then you can check box the box at the very top right hand corner and that will check everything on for you. And then in the top right where that pencil icon is to bulk edit, that will allow you to do a couple different things in bulk. So if it's grayed out, that's not allowing you to do that in bulk, just because a specific there might be one or that whole activity type is not allowing you to do it in bulk for whatever reason. But if that check box lets you check it on, then this is how you can quickly do a couple different things in the platform. So who the activity is visible to that is the eyeball icon. So this is hiding, if you change to teachers only or teachers and observers, it will hide from all of the students. So it's automatically excusing for all of the students at one time, everything that you checked on, you can also change the location. So if you wanna put all of these quizzes to one folder and move everything at one time, you can do that. You can also change the passing score quickly from here. Again, it's set to 60 for epic. But if you want to, if there's a couple quizzes that were off and you wanna make sure they're all 60 you can do that here. Um assessment password. If you want to require the students to enter a password before they take the assessment. Again, this is going to encompass everything that you check on for. So it would be required to be across the board. And then you can also change the number of attempts for quiz. It's currently two, but you can put in custom and change the amount here as well. You'd wanna click the check box confirming that you understand it's permanent update and then that will automatically update all of the items that you checked on there for you. Um Also from this tab, you can preview, so using that triple dots, you'll, you're able to preview this assessment, should you want to before you edit it and then all the way over to the right is group settings. So this was a question that someone had in regards to how to hide maybe an entire unit from one student instead of everybody at the same time. So the lightning bolt in the grade book that we spoke on earlier is the quickest way to excuse one or a few activities from one student or a couple students. Um depending on what you're doing. But if you need to hide an entire unit or a couple units, that might be a little conti time consuming in the grade book. So you can create groupings um within the group settings, you would need to click the wrench icon in the top right hand corner and down to manage groupings and this will allow you to add a group. So for example, I'm just going to put start dates here. So I'm gonna have a few students that are starting at different dates and I might wanna hide some things from them. So the group creation method, I'm gonna do a fixed number of groups because I want there to specifically be two groups. But you can also do a target number of students per group. And then you can select how many students are in groups and that'll based off of how many groups there are. Um And then the group assignment I always select none because I want to choose which students go into which groups. But you can depending on which types of groups you're creating, select random round robin alphabetical the same or different by performance and, or um by the different quarters. Um top or bottom, things like that. So I'm gonna click generate with none. And so then it's automatically gonna give me an, a title right here in the top right hand corner where you have the edit groups with the pencil, you can change this title that it automatically gave you. So I'm gonna title this August, my students that are starting in August and then I'm actually gonna have some more students starting later. So I'll use this little people with the plus button to add a group and then again, I can edit that name and let's say these students start in September. Perfect. So I'm gonna put my student in one group. If for whatever reason, the type of groups that you're determining, you can check off this box and allow your student to be encompassed in both groups. Um But I just want one. So then I'll click save and you'll assign all your students to whichever group you need. And now I have my start date groups. So I'm gonna click the back arrow and then you'll notice you're choosing your grouping. So if you have multiple groups, you can select which one you're affecting right now and then where you're at and then view by either the property, the activity itself, which is the group or the groups will align on the right hand side. So I like to be in property. It's the least confusing for me personally. And then you can either you can change the visibility. So this is only for my students starting in August and this is only for my students starting in September and which groups I put them in. So now I can go in and I'm actually only in the core content, but I'll go back up to the full course. I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in September or I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in August. That way you can hide multiple units, multiple activities from specific groups of students and you don't have to do it from your main page, hiding it from everyone. And I know we went through that rather quickly. We do have a PDF walking through every step and what everything means. And of course, if you have any questions and there's interest in the need of an advanced workshop, we can always do that as well. But I'm gonna go back to my questions tab that you all had um on questions that you asked. And then Sophia, if there's anything in the chat that's not in here, please let me know. Um I, I have a quick question on the groups. Is that something that you said we'll talk more about in the advanced class? Yes. OK. And we have a PDF as well. That kind of gives like a description in depth of every option that you can select. And also this year we're gonna talk about um during office hours uh at the beginning of the year, Megan and Sophia have agreed to join us the first week um on one of the days. So if you have questions or as you guys are getting into it with students and have questions, you can join us as well. But then also um throughout the year, we're going to have specific skills that kind of go along with that time of year uh that we will highlight and um do a video tutorials on as well during office hours. Yes. And the benefit of office hours that we've done in the past is it gives us the opportunity that we only um have one teacher in the, we have the ability to only have one teacher in the zoom meeting at one time and we don't record those. So that way if you have a specific question and you need to share your screen with student data, something's going on with your specific student, we can walk through that and look at your screen together um outside of a group setting where we can't share student data. OK. So I'll just start from the top. One of the questions that was asked is how can we edit calendar pacing for the to do list but not affect the course and date to prevent the course from expiring. Um So the only way to edit the to do list is if you're in a range course mode and that allows you to edit all end dates. But the difference with that is it doesn't give um pacing for the students. And so all of the courses for Epic right now are currently in continuous. So you would not be able to edit those to do estate um outside of changing their enrollment and dates, which is I know was a part of the question said not to. So, but if you do change the enrollment starter and date, that will obviously change the pacing for the student, um I might need a little bit clarification on the next question, but I will go off what I think you're asking and then if you're in the zoom call, let go ahead and let me know if I'm incorrect. But the next question is, can parents slash students change from their app if they want to work ahead? So Epic actually doesn't um for lack of better terms, gate students. So you can work as far ahead as you want and they actually don't even have to work in sequential order. So the students are able to work wherever whenever, as far ahead as they want. That was from a question who from someone who said she wasn't able to make it. Ok. Hopefully you are watching the video back and then if you have another question um or I didn't answer that correctly, please just let Lita or myself know and we can further discuss that. And then the next question was where can I hide things from student view? We covered that in the course editor with the eyeball icon. Even further, you can also hide things from students using the lightning bolt in the grade book with the X and enter and that will excuse it from a specific student. Um How can I change the number of attempts on quizzes, practices or exams? Um That's what we covered earlier, either by the pencil icon in the settings or in that activity list of the editor where you can do multiple things at one time and then same thing with the past threshold, it's gonna be in those settings or in the bulk editing feature. Will the K through two have social studies and science? Um We do provide social studies and science on the bright thinker side from K through two. It might just be that lita and the team are working on them. So you might not see them in the demo just yet, but we do offer them. Um And then can you show us how students take notes? We did cover that in the student side. But if you are still confused on that or have a question, please let me know is there a specific writing course for fourth through eighth to match PS grade books? Lita you might need to help me with that one. I'm not sure what a PS grade book is. The PS is Power School. Um, got it. Yeah, we're doing the, the talking back and forth between, uh, bright thinker and power school to automatically load the grades. So they have to have the same settings and the same forces. Got it. Ok. But I think four through eight we just have English. Correct. Yes. Mhm. As far as what brand thinker offers? Yes. And then is there a general supply list? And that was already answered, they will be shared on the bright thinker channel of epic one. I did wanna mention some of the supply lists as far as we know what you have access to might not be updated just because they have updated all of those courses as of this year. Um So if you're a teacher looking for a supply list, let me go back into the platform at the top of I closed it out. Let me go back in really quick. At the top of any of your courses, you have the ability to view the supply list, the teacher guides, anything like that. So for a K through two course, when you're in the activities, you'll have course resources as a teacher, this one has a pacing guide and then underneath each unit will have the teacher guide and a unit workbook for the students to be able to print everything they need. Should they need it. But in that teacher guide for K through two is where you can find the supply list in here. Um If they have any that's needed and then they also give you supplemental material. Should you wanna add anything outside of what is already covered? And then for those older grade levels, I'll pull up an example. We'll go to fre map. I don't think that fifth grade math will have a supply list, but anything that is needed at the top will be in a PDF for you. Um So this is gonna let you know the course manipulatives needed um throughout the course. And then I know for like some of those higher level courses like biology, they also have course resources at the top. So um teacher guidelines with, with or without the lab manual and then if there's any principles, those will also be within the unit as well. So right within the course, it'll hold that supply list or anything that the students need. Um So we recommend definitely going into the course itself once you have access to them to ensure that's everything that's updated for your specific courses. Um But we are working to update those supply list that you have access to Rita. Ok. And I have access to those courses, so I should be able to pull those. Correct. Absolutely. Mhm. Ok. Um And then one other thing too is last year Lindsay went in and found the, um, the novels that are required for each of the, the uh classes and she put together a tablet that has access to those novels as well. How wonderful. That is awesome. Um, the, yes, the required reading list. I think you have access to this one later, but this will list out everything that's externally required as far as a novel in each grade level and where it's used in each unit as well. Um Let me see where we left off. Is there an upload limit? So I took note of that. I don't believe that there is especially not what the students would be uploading. Um But again, I'll check with Buzz RL MS just to make sure um lita before our advanced workshop, if you have time, let's schedule a time so that we can discuss the admin level permissions that teachers have. Um Just because no one is currently enrolled in courses. So I wasn't able to see that and I didn't want to misanswer anything. Ok. Ok. Awesome. The next question was about how many activities per subject can students expect a week? So again, that's gonna be dependent on their start and end date. As far as the continuous course, it'll automatically pace everything out for them. But if there is a pacing guide at the top of the course for K through two or externally for these other courses, that'll help you just get an idea of what's due and how much is due and then how can the teacher see what standards are covered that's gonna be in that editor. But of course, if you have any questions on how to get back there, let me know and I'll show that again. Sophia, was there any questions in the chat that were not covered in the spreadsheet or what we just discussed? No, I believe you covered it all. Ok. Awesome. Did anybody else have any remaining questions? I have. Oh, go ahead. Ok, real quick. Um, I just added a question. I don't even know if you can see it yet, but are we able to get a copy of that required reading list? Like the books that are required? Yeah. Um, lita, I will send an email over to you and then however you want to make that available. I'll let that be up to Epic. Ok. Thanks. And thank you. Of course. I think someone else had a question at the same time. It, was that the same one or do you have a different one? Uh, yeah, I just kind of maybe wanted your input or some, maybe some other, uh, if there's any other special education, uh, Epic teachers. I've got kind of mixed reviews from teachers who have used. Right. Thinker in the past. Um, some of them are like, it's overwhelming that the additional, uh, like supplies and stuff that they'll need, you know, offline in the curriculum and then some people, um, are like, no, it's usually just like basic stuff that's laying around the house, like for science experiments or for other projects and different subjects. Um I'm primarily gonna be using this for my K through eighth grade uh classes. So, um, did you have any, any thoughts on that? I do. Yes, I do. So, we have gotten that feedback from a lot outside of just epic. And this year was one of the major changes that the curriculum team has gone in and updated the courses and I know they're just gonna continue to be updating them. Um But they have gone in and made more accessible um labs. So let me go in here and show you Sophia. Do you remember the specific courses that they made changes to? I don't have the list on hand. I don't. Exactly, but I can check on my side also. Ok, let me see if I can find an example. Let's talk about them. Ok. So they've gone in, I think it was the higher grade levels in eighth grade, which is not helping you specifically. I'm sorry about that. But I, they might have changed eighth grade as well. Um But I know that they're going in and they're making more virtual labs, more things accessible to students that are um at home, not using the labs specifically in a classroom. Um But if you still see any remaining labs, you are more than welcome to hide them and if you have other labs that you'd like to use, please feel free to do that. But I know that the curriculum team is going in and they're updating some of those so that they are more accessible because there are a few that require things like um a balance beam that students might not have access to or a microscope and different things like that. So, ok, that was my kind of my follow up thought there was maybe to just omit it if it was too complicated and that won't have too big of an impact on. I mean, it'll have an impact but not too big of an impact on their grade or. Well, I guess if you admit it, it won't have any impact on their grade but correct, but it wouldn't be hindering them from learning anything for like a specific quiz or la um test or anything like that. All the labs are separate. So the quizzes will just cover the lessons themselves and then the practice and unit test will cover the quizzes and um lessons. OK. Good, good to know. And it's really easy to going through the editor to add a dry lab too if you wanted to. Um So if you have like a video like on youtube, that maybe corresponds to what the lab was, you can upload that with some questions that they can then do in lieu of the lab that's listed there. OK. Good idea. In that advanced workshop, we'll be covering more in depth on the different types of activities. You can create how to do those groupings, more in depth, how everything applies to each other. So in the meantime, from this um meeting to the next, if you have any questions for LITA or you're like, I really wanna learn more advanced on this. Please let us know and we'll make sure to cover that in the next training and we'll keep the spreadsheet open. So if you uh go away and come back with some more questions, you can update that spreadsheet and we'll definitely keep looking at that for uh the next training as well. Awesome. I just wanted to give a couple of seconds to make sure nobody had any other questions, but it seems like they've all been answered. So me and Lida will meet together before our next meeting and make sure that I'm aware of all of the settings that you'll have access to as far as um in regards to your administrative training or your administrative application so that I can fully answer all your questions. We'll go in more in depth as far as um the different types of activities you can create in epic specifics. And then as long as everybody has access to that epic quick start guide, I think that will be very beneficial to you. All the required reading actually might be right within that quickstart guide if I remember correctly but um I will send that in an email to LITA and then she will inform you on where that is available. But thank you for all your time today. It has been a pleasure and yes, le to put in the chat. The next meeting is Wednesday, August 10th and I have one, just one note about that August 10th. I believe that is a professional development epic professional development day. Ok. Does that mean you all have a lot of other trainings that day as well? Yeah, we have to travel to Oklahoma City that day, but the way they do it now, I think it's just by teams. I'm not sure if it's everyone. Uh Luta, do you know, will we just watch the recording if, if that's the case? Yes, I'll definitely make sure everything's recorded and available and if you wanted to, if you've got questions that you want us to cover and you're not able to go, you can always add up to that spreadsheet and we'll make sure that we cover it in, in the course as well. Ok. Awesome. Thank you for the input. I had no idea. So, yes, the next meeting would be August 10th at 1 p.m. If you're welcome. If you're able to join, we would love to have you. But of course, if not, we'll report it again and make sure you get that. That is all I have to share for you today. Lida. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? Um No, I just thank you guys for joining us and having these great questions and conversations. It's definitely we wanna make sure it's tailored for what you guys need. So awesome.

I would love for you to really participate in today's lesson by joining our live session with the code on the screen or using the link in the chat. Sometimes the link can be the easiest thing, but whatever works for you. And I would love for you guys to participate in that awesome open activity that's already on your live lesson. Um I think it's really fun and it's just really great way to kick off the morning. The live lesson link is in the chat or you can use the code that's on the screen and go to join dot airpod dot com, whichever way is more convenient for you and we are going to get started momentarily. Oh, I'm glad that you thought that that was fun. Rhonda. That's great. All right. All right, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I am happy that you are here. Um If you haven't had a chance to join our live lesson, I would love for you to do that. You really will gain the most out of our session today. You can use that code that's on the screen or you can use the link that's in the chat. I have two of my awesome colleagues here with me today and I wanna make sure that I introduce them before I introduce myself. Um I have Liz Pearce and Tracy Mikos here. They're gonna be helping me with the chat. So if you have any questions at all during our session, you can go ahead and drop them in the chat and one of us will be sure to help support you along the way. Um Again, I am Ashley Bridges. Um I'm coming to you today from Charlotte, North Carolina. Um You could see a little bit about me at the bottom of the screen. Hashtag edition. I'm coming to you from Charlotte, but I am born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which automatically makes me a diehard Steelers fan if you don't like the Steelers, I'm not really sure what to tell you at this point. Um I am ad E I advocate and I love culturally responsive pedagogy. Um I kick box about four times a week. I am a target and Amazon expert, right? Any and all things targeted Amazon. I know all about it. Um I'm an H BC U grad. I am a tea lover. I drink tea every single day, multiple times a day. Um hot and cold and most importantly, I am a teacher at heart. Um I taught sixth grade math and I also taught fourth grade for me personally, I think fourth grade was about my sweet spot. I used near pot all along the way really? Because it made my instruction easier. Um So that's a little bit about me. I hope that you guys enjoyed that first activity. It's really fun. It actually took me a couple of times to get those all correct. Um So that's interesting to see how you guys were able to get them correct as well. So we are gonna go ahead and start if you haven't not had a chance to um load the lesson. I would love for you to go ahead and join our live lesson. That's how you are going to gain the most out of our session today. You can see that I can toggle between the student side and the teacher side. I'm gonna toggle back to the teacher side and I can see that some of you attempted that activity, which is really awesome. Just so, you know, you are here for learning and creating with near pod. So I wanna give you a second to go ahead and read these learning objectives to yourself and then we're gonna talk about them just a bit here. All right. So ultimately, I know that this says a lot of different words, hopefully they mean something to you. They definitely mean something to me. But my goal by the end of today is to give you a dis an additional tool in your toolbox that is going to make your teaching life easier. I know that we have all sat on those PD sessions myself included and we're like, ok, you've given me a task and now it's just made my life harder, right? I want to give you something that is going to free up time and it's going to make your life easier and your students more engaged. So by the end of our session today, you'll be able to launch a near pod, you'll be able to find edit and create your own near pod lesson. Um You're going to be able to really enhance student instruction through engagement. And most importantly, you're gonna be able to receive that data that you need to adapt your instruction. Um Ultimately, your life is gonna be easier. By the end of today. I do want to give you a little caveat here. I'm going to say so many things to you do not feel pressured to have to do them all at once. Take it one step at a time if you only leave today with one thing, hey, that's better than what you came in with, right? Do not have to, you do not have to go in and do all of the things I've shown you today. Just start with one and then build upon that near pot is super user friendly. So it will not be challenging for you to do that at all. All right. So I wanna point out something at the very beginning of our session because this is this is going to be a game changer for you. So on the right hand side of your screen, you will see a little notes tab, it looks like a pen and a paper. This is on your near pod live session. Um And you can click that and you can go ahead and select whether you want the notes from this lesson to be emailed. Um One drive Google Drive, whichever is your preferred method. And that is going to allow you to type notes on each slide and you will receive a copy of every single slide that I go over today, as well as all of the resources I go over. Um Let's say you don't wanna do this right now and you wanna do it halfway through our lesson. That is totally fine. But I wanted to make sure I pointed out this feature so that you can continue your learning um throughout the day, throughout the week and throughout the school year, right? You can go back and reference, what did she say when she brought that up again, right? You can go ahead and reference that this is also something that you can do with your students. Um They can go ahead and get in that habit of taking notes and they'll just be able to look back at your sessions and make sure that they continue their learning experience. Um So if you wanna turn that on, I'll go ahead and give you a minute to do so. Alrighty. So what is near pod? Some of you may know exactly what it is because you use it every day. Some of you are like, I don't even know what you're talking about, right? Um So near pod is a tool that's gonna help you actively engage your students and provide teachers with that real time data. So we're gonna come up with our own definition because I really want you to shape what is near pod to you. I understand that you are the expert in your classroom and that you are gonna shape it to be everything that it is right near pod is not amazing without you. So I want you to create your own working definition of near pot in your head. Um All right. So we are going to watch a video on your side of the screen, you will see eyes up front, right? That means you need to come back to my zoom screen and that's what your students will see. Um I have the option to either do teacher plays or student plays. Um For the sake of this lesson, I'm going to do a teacher plays so you guys can watch it from my zoom. But if you want students to play this video at their own place pace, you can hit student plays. So I'm gonna go ahead and play this video introducing near pod with near pod. You can make every lesson, interactive launch lessons, your students can't wait to join with interactive slides, interactive video Gamification and activities. All right. So now a question is gonna pop up smack dab in the middle of my video, right? This is something that you can do to easily get students engaged in your content. So which of the following ways are you most interested in learning about? Right? What makes you excited to learn about near pod? And you can go ahead and answer that on your screen. Sometimes it takes a second to load. So if you need to reload um your near pod screen to go ahead and answer that question, that would be great. All right. So what's gonna happen here is when we have responses, you're going to be able to share the solution. It is going to be a pie chart, right? And you're going to see what students selected, what answer and you'll be able to see. Ok. Well, my students are excited about Gamification. They're excited about active learning and then you can automatically adjust your instruction to go along with that. So we're gonna continue watching this video as the teacher, you always know where your students are with near pod's formative assessments including polls, open ended questions and more. Get started with what you already have. Add the power of near pod to your existing powerpoints, worksheets, videos, Google slides and other curriculum resources. You love create active video experiences to check for understanding with built in interactive questions, increase engagement with Gamification and activities including time to climb, draw it, drag and drop and more. Get started even faster with our library of premade standard aligned lessons, videos and activities built in partnership with some of your favorite educational brands, use them as is or customized to meet the unique needs of your students. Once you're ready to launch your lesson, choose the teaching mode that works best for your setting. In live participation mode, you control the pace and students participate on their devices in person or virtually in student pa mode. Students move through and participate on their own, working from home or in class in centers stations or groups toggle between live and student p lesson delivery with live to student paste mode to address misconceptions on the fly and differentiate for student needs with front of class mode. You can use near pod without student devices and facilitate collaborative discussions. Your students will love lessons that combine interactive slides, interactive video Gamification and activity. You'll love using insights for more than 20 formative assessments and dynamic media experiences to guide your teaching adapt instruction, differentiate and improve student outcomes. However, you teach, it's in near pod. All right. So now you will see a question on your screen based on what you learned so far. How would you describe near pod to a friend? Um Like I said, if you do not see this question on your live lesson, you may want to reload that screen. So you are able to see the question and then your answers will pop up here on the zoom. So I will give you a few minutes to go ahead and type your response. Mm All right. So we are going to go ahead and move on. Hopefully you are able to submit this question. Let's see. I see that some of it is not loading. So I'm gonna go ahead and reload my screen here. All right. So something that's really awesome about this is I can see this participation percentage on this right hand side, for example, it says 77%. So if I'm in class teaching the students, I'm gonna say, oh, I can see that 77% of you have responded. Where's the rest? Right? You wanna encourage those students to respond. So we can see that Emily here says an interactive lesson platform for students um an interactive learning pool. Um I would describe NA Pod as an interactive lesson format that helps keep students engaged with their learning. Suzanne. That's a really, really great explanation to NA POD. And that's how I would describe it to my friends as well. I also want to point out this feature because while we watch this video, now I can share a response to your screen. So now all of you on your NA pod will be able to see Suzanne's response. So that's really, really great as well to make sure that you're encouraging students to use their voice. Um So like you guys already mentioned, N POT allows for 100% student participation. It allows students to partake in that discussion and gives teachers that formative assessment data. It's great for whole groups and small, small groups. It's great for students working at their own pace. Um If you're anything like me, I lived by a, by a playlist in my classroom. I was like, ok, here's what the students have to do for the next two weeks. I would give it to them after our mini lessons and they'd work through at their own pace. Near pod is great for that. Whether you're doing a whole group instruction, small group and across all different grade levels. So now I want you to participate in this open ended discussion. Think about it. What can happen to learning when every student has the opportunity to participate in every single question. I'm gonna give you a moment to go ahead and answer that. All right. So we have some responses coming in. Um Sherry said every student has the opportunity to learn, right? Even though that sounds like the easiest thing to do, we know as teachers that can be super challenging sometimes. So, yes, absolutely. Um We can see strengths and weaknesses and adjust it for the students in the future, right? I think that is super important right? To be able to adjust our instruction. That's a skill that only teachers have. I feel like um everyone feels like their answers matter if I could like snap to you in person right now, I absolutely would because I think that that student voice is really, really important and it allows students to build that confidence in their own thought process, um better classroom engagement and you have the opportunity uh to make sure everyone understands, I can click this answer. I could tell that hers was a little bit longer um to make sure that everyone understands what is being thought taught. Thank you, Kaitlyn. Students feel included and you can see all over the class how they're grasping the concept, how they're accepting what you're teaching. Are they meeting those learning goals and objectives that you set potential for more engagement, increased overall learning, right? You guys have some really, really awesome responses. Now, with this open ended question, I wanna switch to the student side and I wanna show you guys something. If you take a look at my Zoom screen, you can see what looks like a little book and a speaker phone on the right hand side, this is the coolest integration in my personal opinion, right? Because like we said, we want to make sure that all students are able to learn. There shouldn't be any blogs, any um thing that's getting in the way. So this immersive reader feature definitely takes that up a notch. So let's say you have a student where English is not their first language or they're an ell student, right? We can go ahead and click this book feature, then we have tons of languages to choose from. Um Let's go ahead and uh select Chinese traditional and we are going to translate the whole document that you make. I think that is the coolest thing ever because now no matter where that student is coming from, no matter what experiences they may have at home, they can now participate in the learning, right? It's also great for our younger kids because we can have it, just read it out to them in English. Let's say you wanna make sure students are still getting that rigorous critical thinking skills, but they may be a struggling reader. You can have it, read it out to them. Maybe they struggle with typing on a computer, you can have them record their audio and the teachers still gonna receive all this data in real time. They'll also be able to see it at the end of their lesson, but they can see while students are actively participating in it. So I think that that is a really awesome feature uh to point out and you can select whichever the students will have that option to select that on their computer. They can pick whatever language um they need and they will easily become um adaptive to it. They'll be like, OK, I have to go on here and I have to select my language. It will be no problem for them. So like you guys mentioned when every student has the voice, it's really gonna transform that teaching and that student engagement, right? As a teacher, it is going to allow you the opportunity to check for understanding, check for misconceptions. You're gonna be able to identify who's mastering and who's not mastering content, right? And most importantly, you're going to make sure that you have a diverse group of thoughts and opinions and that is going to encourage those students to use their voice. All right. So one of my favorite features on Nerd is this collaborate board. Um So you guys can go ahead and participate in this um on your screen. How do you currently facilitate conversations? And let's get real for a moment. What are some challenges that you and your students are experiencing during classroom discussions? I'll give you a moment to go ahead and respond. Yeah, students not participating. If you see anything that you agree with or that just resonates with you, you can go ahead and hit that love button. Um That is definitely 100% true. Lack of engagement. The same students always responding. I I could think back. I had this one student, her name was Lacey and she every single time was like my go to student and then she even sometimes got upset whenever I didn't call her. I'm like Lacy, like you cannot be the only one to answer the questions. I'm sure we all have um a student like that. But yeah, this definitely will encourage all students to use their voice. Open ended questions in a virtual school. Many students are camera shy in a group. Oh my goodness. I can think about when I was teaching virtually and you have a bunch of students that like they're there, but they're like ghosts. It's really, really hard to get them engaged. And sometimes as a teacher, it can be difficult to know what they know and what they don't know, students talking over each other. Oh, not balanced. Yeah, that can be really challenging. Lisa said time for everyone to talk or trying to get everyone to participate, right? So those are some challenges that we all face I faced in the classroom. Um challenges that will probably continue for many of teachers, but we wanna make sure that we give you this tool of Napo to hopefully kind of solve some of those basic challenges that we're having. Um Amanda, I really want to rejoice because being in a virtual setting, I find students don't want to ask questions over zoom but platforms like near pod and who allow students to answer without others seeing, right? Students get embarrassed because they're like, oh, what if I'm not? Right. Right. And so sometimes it's hard to encourage them to kind of get over that fear. So that's a great point, Amanda. All right. So we're gonna talk about today just really how to spark those conversations. Um We've already done some of that basically through our session. So you guys participated in an open ended question. That is something easy to do with your students. Typically, they do not have to reload. I don't know what tech issues that I'm having to just bear with me on that front. Um But you can go ahead and add add those open ended questions. So students can automatically explain their thinking, explain their thought. Um The poll that we did at the beginning during the video, you can incorporate those to kind of gauge what their, where students are and what stand they're taking. My personal favorite is the Draw it feature which we're going to talk about next and I am a math person at heart. Um I have taught all subjects, but I like teaching math the most and I really felt like the draw it feature made my math instruction 10 times easier. If you are a math person, you will understand why I'm saying that. So this is an example of the teacher perspective of what the draw it feature looks like. Now on your end, you will see this screen right here. Um It's gonna have a pen, a highlighter, a text box, a picture box and an eraser. These are our learning objectives that we did at the beginning of our session today. And what I like to do is take something that's traditionally a teacher led portion of the lesson and make it a student led portion. So I was one of those teachers that was like, OK, I love annotation. Can you highlight the important words? Can you tell me what you need to pull out of these words on your screen? Now, the students can do that. So if you wanna go ahead and highlight some important things that you think you really wanna gain out of our objectives today. That would be great. You can use the pen. If you click the pin, it changes different colors, the highlighter, you can highlight teaching engagement, whatever makes you happy. And while students work on that, I can see actively see who's participating what they're highlighting. Um If they have not submitted it, it will say in progress and you'll see this yellow. Um If they have hit that submit button at the bottom of their screen, it will turn green. And if it says awaiting drawing, that means they haven't started yet. So that also tells me what and when I'm teaching during class, what students may not be working on what um I'm actively going on so you can scroll down, you can see all of the students and I'm gonna share uh Laurie's because I think that is super cute and everyone needs to spread a little bit of love and something that's really cool about this is I can click this now and if I see an exemplar, I'm like, this is the one my students loved whenever I shared their work and I could hit it. And now on all of your screens, you will see Laurie's work. That is super cool. I love this feature for math because it allows students, students to showcase their work and then I can share it out with all of the other students. Um It also makes it really easy for me to identify common misconceptions when I can see everyone's work on the same page. So I think that that is really cool. The work is 100% anonymous. No one is going to know you can actually um turn off the student name so that let's say you were teaching um via zoom and you didn't want and students were looking at your screen, you don't want them to see whose work is, who's, you can go ahead and turn that off. Um, or you can have it on, whichever works best for you in your classroom. But when you share it out to the students, they will not see whose work it is. And I think that that's super encouraging and super cool. Now, if I go over to the student side, something else that I love to do is we had those like clunky curriculum books that we absolutely had to use. And I'm like, ok, well, how can I change this up? So I would have a picture of whatever um, topic I was teaching, let's say I'm talking about fractions. In this case, students would also have their book in their computer. I would have them click this button right here and they would upload a picture of their work. So now when I go over to the teacher side, I see pictures of all of the students' work. They loved it. I loved it. It made my life a whole lot easier because now I don't have to go on each individual student and see. OK, what did they do? I can just get a full screen picture of where my students are and that was super, super transformative in my instruction. All right. So we're gonna go ahead and do the fun stuff and let's go ahead and get into near pod. Um I want you guys to have the opportunity to actually explore the things that make near pod the best that it is. Um So we are gonna log in. You all are specifically going to log in through Clever. So you are going to go to your district Clever page, click on the NA pod logo and then it will direct you directly to the NA pod home page. Um I did not say this before you wanna open up an additional tab. So right now you will have my Zoom screen my live lesson and then you'll have an additional tab where you log into Napo through Clever. So I'll give you a moment to go ahead and log in. Yes. Once you do click um Christia, once you do click um on someone's work, they will no longer be able to work on it. But that's only if you share it to the whole class. So if I choose not to share it, the students will still be able to work on it. All right. Um If you are logged into your clever, that is great. If you are having issues getting into near pod, please type your first and last name as well as your email in the chat. So we can make sure that we are able to support you with getting in. Um, a couple of people said it's under supplemental supplemental curricula. Yes, Melissa. Um, we're actually going to go over that, which is a really awesome question. Are the students responses saved? They are saved and you are going to be able to look at them later. We're gonna talk about um the end of lesson reports at the end. All right. So if you wanna follow along with me on my zoom screen, maybe you wanna split your screen so you can go at the same time, we're going to explore this near pod library together. So for me on my screen, I'm going to go ahead and click on the left hand side near pod library and then it pulls up this awesome collection of featured lessons. Now, if you're anything like me, I'm gonna have a moment of transparency here. There's some really great things I wanted to teach about but just did not have the time to make those lessons from scratch, right? So that's what these featured lessons are for. They have lessons on Independence Day, promoting inclusion, fostering emotional health, um different sel lesson skills, test prep strategies, things that you do not have to go in and make from scratch but are already there for you. And I think that that's a really great feature, these featured lessons change depending on what time of year it is, what holidays are happening. Um What is happening around the world. This is that opportunity for students to really grow personally and professionally. And I love that additional push, which I'm sure some of you will as well. Um And you will see in the chat um my colleague Liz dropped Tanya's um email. You will need to email Tanya your first and last name. Um and also my colleagues will support you with that. So if you have any questions about your, your near pot or your clever not working, um We'll definitely get that squared away for you. Now, let's talk about the meat, the bread and butter, whatever you wanna call it. This is the best part we are going to go in and filter bystander. So I can go ahead over here to one and I can select a state or common core since you guys are in Oklahoma. I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down to Oklahoma. I'm gonna select math or whatever subject you teach. Then I'm gonna select a grade level which is fourth and then this is the coolest part to me. Then I can select the strand specifically that I'm looking for. So you can use this feature for lessons that you love teaching lessons that you do not like teaching days that you may be absent and you know, you need a quick lesson to give to your students and give to the sub this feature is great for that. Um So for this case, I'm going to use um four a one use multiple representations of patterns to solve real world and mathematical problems. So now it has gone through and filtered fourth grade lessons, activities and videos that go with this standard specifically, right? So you can scroll down, you'll see videos, you'll see premade lessons. Um You'll see activities, you see time to climb, which we'll talk about a little bit later. And so now that is taking the headache out of you finding um a lesson or creating something from scratch. Um For me when I was absent, this is what I use because I know that sub sub plans can be a little bit daunting from time to time, but we know that we want learning to continue on even when we're not there. And sometimes we want that to be something as simple as finding a lesson that is going to make sure my students are engaged and that they're still gaining what they would if I wasn't there. Um So if I go ahead and preview this lesson, um I see what you're saying in the chat, you said I have a search bar but not the drop downs for choosing standards. Ok? We'll go back and talk about the search bar as well. Um So if I were to preview a lesson, for example. Um this is place value and patterns. I think it's always best practice to preview because like we said, you're the expert in your classroom. So you know what's gonna work for your students and what's not gonna work. So you can preview, see the lesson materials, the essential question. It's gonna give you a pacing guys. We, we know this lesson is gonna take about 50 minutes. And so if I feel like, OK, this lesson works for me, I can add it to my lessons. OK? And we're gonna come back to that shortly. Um I wanted to address a question that I saw in the chat. Mine pops up on the left hand side. OK? So we do have a global search bar here at the top. This is a new feature. Um it near pod is slowly rolling it out. So if you do not see the search bar at the top, do not fret, you will have it soon. Um It's just taking a little bit of time, but everyone will get the global search bar at the top and it will move from the left to the top. So if you, like I said, if you wanted to go ahead and click through the near pod library, I'm gonna give you a moment to do that. A couple of minutes. Just click the near pod library on the left hand side and then you can filter it by standards up here on the right. Um And go ahead and select one lesson that you would like to add to your library. I'm gonna give you four minutes to go ahead and select one and play around a bit. If you have any questions, you can drop those in the chat and I'll address those um during this little workshop time. Sure, Angie. Let me go ahead back for you. I'm sorry that I was moving a bit too fast. Um If you wanna hop over to my Zoom screen, I can show you all one more time how to filter this with the standard. So I'm on my home screen and then I clicked near pod library. Um Then I go up here on the right hand side and I hit filter by standard. After I hit filter by standard, it pulls down this little drop down menu. I can hit the standard or the state. I know you guys are in Oklahoma. So I went, I'm gonna scroll down to Oklahoma and then you can select a subject, whatever subject you would like language, arts, math, science or social studies. I'm gonna select math, then I'm going to pick fourth grade and then you can select whichever strand you would like what we have. Um The English language learners program is an additional um program that is purchased. So some of you may um not have some of the global search features like I said near pod is rolling this out slowly. Um So if you do not have it, do not fret, everyone will have it, but I wanted to make sure to show you guys how to kind of access that. So, so I'm on an updated screen. So some of you may not have some of the features that I'm having but do not fret, you will have it. All right. So we are going to go ahead and stop for a second. We're gonna slow down and we're gonna take a look at our home screen. So if you just click that near pod logo, right? So we can scroll down and I see this lesson that I've added from my search. So I have gone ahead and I've added place value and patterns. Now we can, like I said, we can always preview a lesson. It's always best practice to preview. Um Let's say I like this lesson for my students and I wanna hit edit. So now you can go in and you can personalize this lesson. You do not have to start from scratch, but you can personalize this lesson. I would love for you to follow along with me on my zoom screen right now. So you can kind of see how I'm working through this. So I have two buttons here, edit lesson or duplicate lesson. Now, I do not want to have two copies of this lesson. So I'm just gonna hit edit lesson. It's not gonna edit it for the whole near pod community. It is just going to edit it for you personally. So I'm gonna click edit lesson and now it pulls up this lesson on place value and patterns. Um Let's say I see a couple of things that I don't like or there's some language that my students are not used to. I can go click this open ended question here and now I can edit it to fit what my students need. Or if I want to add additional words, I can say, make sure to, to explain um something else that you can do on the screen. That's really, really cool is that you can also add a timer. Now, I was probably the pacing police in my classroom. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's not a good thing. But I wanted to make sure my students were prepared for end of grade testing. And I think the pandemic made pacing really challenging for students. They started work, at least my students, they were working really, really slowly. So I like to add a timer and I can go in and say, OK, I know I want my students to work on this for 10 minutes. They should be able to complete it in 10 minutes automatically. Once they get on there, it's going to load that timer, they will be able to see it and it will go for 10 minutes and then it will shut off and they will have to move on to the next question. Um, you do not have to add a timer and obviously that's up to your discretion for me. I did 10 minute math every day to make sure I was keeping those students sharp. But if that's not for you, no problem at all. Ok. How did you get to the box with the lesson? To edit or copy the lesson? So I will go back here for a second. So when I go to my lessons, there's a little box at the bottom right hand or left hand corner, excuse me, that says edit. It looks like a pencil with a box. And then all I do is click edit and then now I can all of a sudden edit this lesson. Hopefully that clears up. Sure, I can show you where the timer is one more time. No problem. So I'm gonna open up this lesson and I'm gonna just scroll down to this open ended question that we were on before the timer is kind of hidden to the right hand side. It'll say add timer and then you can add a timer to that activity. All right. So let's go ahead and we are going to just save and exit this lesson. All right. So you can go back to your zoom screen here for a second. So I wanna talk about something. I wanna give you guys a good amount of workshop time. And so I wanna give you a little bit of information and then I'm gonna allow you to work at your own pace and ask me questions if you have any. So we wanna talk about your resources. But better now, like I said, at the beginning of this lesson or at this session, I wanted to give you tools in your toolbox that make your life easier. Not that add something on top of your plate, that's gonna take you a whole bunch of, of additional time, but that makes your life easier. So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at this very unconventional way of solving a very simple problem. So if you take a look at my zoom screen and follow along with me as we watch this video. Yes, I love how they call this the fun theory. Um because I know ultimately, at the end of the day, we want our students to find learning fun and exciting. So I would love to hear your thoughts on this collaborate board. What did you observe? What remained the same about the stairs and what changed? And how would this apply to resources that you already use in your classroom? I'm glad you guys love that video. It's super great, right? You're like, wow, that's such a good idea. I wanna walk on those stairs too. Christy. Students are more engaged when we make lessons, more engaging. Absolutely. Kimberly. I'm gonna love that message totally agree, multisensory. This is such an awesome thought because I don't think that anybody has said that yet. So I'm glad that you brought that up, Courtney. We can use our materials but make them more engaging. Absolutely. Kimberly, the stairs became interesting and more people wanted to try them. I don't know about you guys. But if I saw stairs that made music, I absolutely would go on them because typically I'm the first person to get on the escalator, especially in New York City. There's so many stairs there. Um, I think I missed the fir first part, but I'm assuming that they had no music, right? So, if you missed the first part of the video, no problem. It was just regular stairs. So basically, let's say they were conduct, conducting a research study to see who takes the escalator over the stairs. And more people took the escalator over the stairs until they made the stairs turn into music, which was super cool. I'd have trouble getting to work, but because I'd be playing on there. Yeah, probably me too. Absolutely. Um, I'm glad you guys enjoyed that video. I think it's a really great way to kind of showcase how you can just make something that's super conventional and turn it into something awesome and exciting for students because even as adults, we like things that are exciting and fun and bring out our inner child and allow us to be expressive. Um, so, absolutely Thank you guys for sharing all of your thoughts. Um Melissa, the stairs were the same size but still used for going from one floor to the other, right? It still solved the same problem. Um The added piano keys made them more fun and engaging as teachers. Um We can look at our own resources and see how to adapt them or make them more engaging. Absolutely correct. Melissa. OK. Some people mentioned jam boards, right? Very collaborate boards are super similar. That's why I love these and I like how you can hit the love button on them to show classmates some love. And I think it also kind of gives students that confidence when other students um like their messages or love their messages. So let's talk about your stairs, right? So your stairs may be a PDF, it may be a powerpoint, it may be a Google Slides. If you were like me, you were a Google Slides person. I did everything on there. Um That was my bread and butter. So that was my stairs. So whatever your stairs may be, whether they're an image, a PDF, we're gonna start with that and we're going to build upon that. So if you follow along with me on my screen, I'm gonna try to go through this fairly slowly here. So I wanna make sure you gain everything. So we're gonna start with the stairs. We're gonna create an engaging lesson using something we already have right. So I'm gonna hit this button right here that says create and on your screen, you'll see that button, create and then you'll see lesson. So I'm gonna go ahead and hit lesson now, I'm brought to this blank screen. Now if you're anything like me, you love organization. So make sure that you title your lessons just to make sure that you can stay organized and follow along and know exactly um what's going on. So once you bring up this screen to create a lesson, you'll hit this button that says upload files. This is where I'm going to choose my stairs now for you, um It may be a Google doc. It may be a powerpoint, it may be a dropbox one drive for this case, I'm going to select Google Drive and I'm going to search for my lesson on sums and differences. OK. This is a quick um powerpoint lesson. I actually used this very lesson a couple of months ago in my classroom and then it'll bring this up. It says would I like to upload it as individual slides or as a PDF viewer? I'm going to hit individual slides for the purpose of this lesson and then you'll see on the bottom it is um processing the file, right. So it is going to make that file fit right into near pod. Now, if you choose to upload a larger file or a powerpoint, that may be 50 slides, it is going to take a little bit longer time because it's going to compress that file to make sure it fits into near pod. Um So it has loaded all six of my slides. Um This is about fluently adding and subtracting multi digit whole numbers, right? I loved this lesson. So this is something I literally use in my classroom. So I am going to give you four minutes to find a lesson of your own and you're just gonna upload it and then we're gonna stop there and we're gonna move on to adding activities to that lesson. If you have any questions during this workshop time, let me know and I'll be sure to address them and I'm setting the timer for four minutes. I'm so excited to hear that you guys found some of those virtual reality lessons. I'm definitely going to touch on that students. Absolutely love that. Um So that's great. Uh Laurie and Ashley, I like your name Ashley by the way. Um So you don't have to input any active codes whenever you launch a lesson, a launch a lesson, which we will do shortly. Um It will automatically generate a code for you. You do not have to do that about 2.5 minutes left to just find a lesson and upload it. Um Angela, I see you said you only have preview. So you have to add a lesson to your library before you have the edit button. So make sure you hit add to library and then go to your library and you'll be able to edit if that is what you are attempting to do. Yeah. So you can absolutely add the slide show and it will keep your slides. Now, you will not have your transition. So if you're someone who likes to swipe it to the left, um up into the right or whatever the case may be, um, you will not have that part available on your screen. It will just take the slides and input it into an airpod. OK. Good Angela. I'm glad you were able to get that figured out. Great. So just about 30 more seconds, I hope you have found a lesson uploaded it and then we're gonna chunk it into the next thing. Um So Jessica, can you clarify your question one more time? Um Are you saying that you only want to import particular slides or you're having difficulty up, difficulty uploading all the slides? All right. So once you have slides now, if keep in mind, if you uploaded a huge powerpoint or a huge document, it may be taking some time to um compress those files to get them loaded into near pot. But here we have my slide and now we're gonna talk about when and why. So I want you to take a second to think about your current lessons and share in this collaborate board when and why you currently ask questions to help guide your instruction. And what does that look like for you in your classroom? If you are able to um switch to that near pod live lesson and do a collaborate board? That would be great. I understand some of you probably are still working on getting things uploaded and we're toggling between a couple of different tabs. So thank you for bearing with me on this morning. Amy says she asked questions periodically to check for understanding. Yes, Christa, either when it doesn't feel like students are grasping the content or a check in, right? You gotta have those built in check ins, right? They tell us a lot as teachers and they help the students feel supported. Devani Devanny. I hope I'm saying your name correctly if I'm not. I am so sorry, please type the correct pronunciation in the chat. Um Checking for understanding. Should I move on or go back and teach a different way that re looping sometimes is really important. Um After a concept has been introduced, um I love check for understanding. I use it every second I possibly could because I really wanted my students to feel like I was catering my learning and my instruction to what they needed. I ask questions to check for understanding and to help keep students en engaged. Absolutely. Misty, exit tickets. I love exit tickets to gauge understanding, to make sure everyone is following and ready to move on. Absolutely. All right. So we have our stairs uploaded into near pod. Now, we're going to enhance our stairs. We're gonna add the music, add the razzle dazzle, add the excitement. Right. So now we're gonna add those activities. Some of those things that you guys already saw were like virtual reality. Um So we're gonna go ahead and, and jazz up our lesson. So if you follow along with me here, I will give you some more workshop time to play with it on your own. Um So that you can make sure that you kind of are grasping and I'll give you an opportunity to ask me some questions in the chat if you have any. So you will see my screen here. This is that same lesson I talked about, about fluently adding and subtracting multi digi numbers. It was just a Google slides, powerpoint, regular dear. OK. So now um I told you guys, I love the draw it feature. So I'm going to start with that. I can click this slide here that I already made in Google slides and I can automatically convert it to a draw it slide. So this is just a warm up question. It's gonna ask me, would you like to create a draw it from this slide? Do you wanna make a copy of that slide and keep the original? I'm gonna say no, I do not need um an original copy. I just want to draw it slide. So I'm gonna hit No. And now I've transformed that page into a draw up page. I'm gonna show you what that looks like. OK. So now I can see that this has become a draw side for me. I told you guys I did 10 minute math every day. So if this is my warm up question, um students will have 10 minutes to complete it. So I'm gonna scroll down, set a timer for 10 minutes. I'm gonna add it. Like I said, that timer is up there in the right hand corner and then if I wanted to add a picture, I could add a picture. I could search Google and upload a file, something else. That's really cool. If I'm absent, I can hit a voice recorder, right. I can now record my voice. Hey, students, I want you to take a moment to complete this 10 minute math activity. I can play it. Hey, students, I want you to take a moment to complete this 10 minute math activity. Let's say I'm absent and I need students to know that I'm still watching. I'm still making sure they're participating or let's say I just need to explain specific instructions to them. I can add that in there as well. Now, when students get to this slide, they will have a drawl, they will be able to annotate, they will be able to have the p and the highlighter, they'll be able to show their work, upload a picture. If they want. So I've taken what was very basic in my Google slides presentation and I've leveled it up with a super easy 12 step. So I'm gonna go ahead and save that. All right. So something else that I can do is I can hit this big button here that said as add content and activities. So I am gonna go ahead and add an activity here. Let's say I wanted to add a open ended question. What are you most ready to learn today? Now, I can kind of gauge what students are feeling. Are they excited? Are they having one of those mundane days? Are they like, OK, it's super early. I don't really feel like doing this now. I can kind of gauge where students are and I can hit save. I've automatically added an open ended um question into my lesson. I can drag this around. Let's say I want to have that at the beginning. I drag it around. Something else that we can go ahead and add is I know that some of you are really, really excited about the collaborate boards and about virtual reality. So I'm gonna go ahead and add a virtual reality field trip. And for me, I'm gonna make it as a brain break field trip. Sometimes you're going through those lessons and students are like, I need a break. This is hard, especially if you're teaching a concept that they've never ever heard of or seen before. And so I'm gonna just take a trip to Greece because why not? It's absolutely beautiful. I have been there and I just want to see it again. Um, if I wanted to preview it to see what it's gonna look like for my students, I can go ahead and preview it and I can hit done. And now it's added that field trip and let's say I wanna add another virtual reality trip. And this time since students are working on sums and differences, I wanna go to a candy store and I'm gonna take them to the candy store, add that virtual reality field trip in the air. And then I'm gonna add a question after that field trip that has them. Say, where do you think you would use sums and differences in a candy store? I'm gonna take that to a collaborate board. How do you think you would use some and different in this candy store? So now students have the opportunity to participate in an active discussion? Ok. So now it took me about five minutes to go ahead and take my regular power points that I uploaded from Google slides and add those additional activities. So I absolutely want to give you all some more workshop time here to go ahead and add at least two activities to your current lesson that you uploaded and just think about how you would get data from those lessons. Um I'll give you a about six minutes. If you have any questions during your workshop time, drop those in the chat. And me and Tracy will try to help make sure those questions get answered for you. Oh, Christy, I love that. That's a great idea. Doing a scavenger hunt for math. Yes, you can. Um, so I see Christy that you ask, can you undo it? So let's say that you are not sure whether you want that activity as a draw or not. You can select the option that says yes, you'll have your original copy and your draw. If you don't want your draw, you can just delete it and you'll still have that slide in there. Your original slide in there. If you have any questions at all while you're doing this workshop time, go ahead and drop them in the chat. No problem, Melissa. Thank you. You can add a voice instruction to the draw it side. Um As you can see on my screen, I've pulled up just an example of the draw it slide that I have. Let me close this on the side and I can hit um audio recording. Sure. Um I can show you how to add the VR Sure. So if you go back to your lesson slide and it should look like this and you can click this button here that says add content and activities and then right here it says, VR Field trip. Hope that helps you out Krista. Great about three more minutes of our workshop time. Yes. So your links will not be active anymore if you are uploading them through near pod. Like if you have converted it to a PDF, um your links will not be active near POT 3D is pretty cool. Um So if you wanted to add an additional activity for students to work on where you can pull up this button where it says content and activities, I believe who had asked this question? Um Angela, um if you go to this button that says web content, you can then add the URL to whatever other page you want to take them to and they will be able to click the URL from their near pod lesson to work on that activity. I hope that answers your question. Sure. If I wanted to add a matching pair, I would type my instructions, hit add pair and then you can add a text or an image and then you, it will match it up like it will say this is the pair and it'll automatically generate on the left hand side, the options for the students and on the right hand side where they should match it to. So for example, um I want to match this my name with the school that I went to. And then all I would have to do is click done. And then if I wanted to have a whole bunch of different pairs similar to the one that we did when we first got on our call today. Um I would just add another pair. All right. Uh Yeah, there is a whole grade level library for matching pairs. Absolutely. So you don't even have to start from scratch. I love that. Um So I hope that you were able to add um reference media, some text, some activities, explore that virtual reality, those 3d, all those cool things that NA Pod has. I hope you were able to add that to your um session. And so I want you to go ahead and switch back to our live lesson and share with me. What activities and content did you add to your lesson? And where do you think they'll fit best? Go ahead and teach me something. Where can I add additional activities and how would they fit into my lessons? I'll give you a couple of minutes to answer that question. Oh, thank you for saying that Suzie. I really appreciate that. I'm glad you had some time, fun time exploring and reminder. What's really cool is from the teacher perspective. I can see as you guys are typing um what you're writing, I can see who's working on um the current content who may be still practicing on the um on the near pod app themselves. Um Alicia, while we um while people are working on this question, I can show you one more time how to change it to a draw it. So if I click the slide, it will say at the top, convert to draw it and I just have to click that button. All right. So if you are finished with that question, you can hit that submit button. If you are still working, that is no problem at all. I just want to show you guys from the teacher perspective. It's really awesome how I can see um what they're doing and what they're typing. Um I can click here right now. You would not be able to see this from the student perspective. But if you are looking at my Zoom screen, you can see what Amber has typed here right here at the beginning of the lesson and how she wants to add discussion boards um on adjectives and adverbs. So students can describe what they see, right? So this is a really awesome way to just get students automatically involved to feel like they're really guiding their own learning experience. No problem Valerie. Um If you just want to follow along, that's no problem at all. So now we're gonna talk about how to transform teaching and learning, right? These are some really cool features that are just one click away that are not gonna cause you a whole bunch of extra effort. So you have three different options here if you're following along on my zoom screen. So you have teacher facilitated independent learning and interactive video. So for example, today I am doing a live participation lesson. So you can see exactly what I see as I click through my slides, that means I'm doing it live. But I also have the opportunity to do student paste and I wanna show you what that looks like on your pod so I can hit save and exit. And so this lesson that I created about songs and differences. Um I have two options. When I hover over it, I can hit live participation or I can hit student pace student paste changes the game. So when I hit student paste, um it tells me about my collaborative boards that they are going to be disabled. If I do student paste, that is fine. So I can hit continue. So then it's gonna bring this up, it is gonna bring up a code and a link. Now you can send this out to your students. You can have a bunch of different student page lessons going on at one time which I think is really cool. Um If I have students that are working on this level, they may be higher up, they may be working on an accelerated lesson. Some students may be working on um remediation and looping back, right? So I can have both of those things going at the same time and I can still get those reports. Um So it will pull up the screen and this option total game changer require student responses and prevent skipping. Now you just spent your hard earned time creating these activities. And the last thing you want your students to do is click through the slides and not do it right. So we can turn that on. Now, students automatically have to watch the whole video or have to respond to the open ended question or do the poll before moving over. So this students from just clicking and say, ok, Miss Bridges, I'm done. Actually, you're not done because you can't do anything. Um And so I love that feature. That's a total game changer, especially teaching remote. Um because now it makes sure that every student is getting the content and sometimes students do not need that choice. And so yeah, I think that's really awesome. Also a cool thing that I wanna show you guys say you're in the middle of a live lesson and you want students to take a second to work independently. I can turn on student paste in the middle of a live lesson. For example, the button is at the bottom of my screen. You guys will not see this because you're not currently in an active live lesson um in your own, but I can turn it on from slide 29 to 31. And students will be able to work at their own pace from slides 29 to 31. And then after my timer goes off and I say, OK, we're gonna come back. I can turn off that student pace mode. So you have two different options to go about student pace there. Um And I like it because you can really shape it to whatever your teaching style is. Um Yeah, I see your question. Let's go back to that. Um So you can click here and it says 29 days remaining. You can adjust the dates when you just click on that calendar button. Hope that helps you out Trina. All right. So now I would love for you guys to do this little drag and drop activity, add labels to how you might use your lesson in the different modes. There's no right or wrong answer. I kind of just wanna know what you guys would do in your classroom. Give you a few minutes to work on that. All right. So I can see some of you are in progress, some of you have submitted already. Um It's super exciting for me to hear how you would integrate um these different methods in your classroom. And so I, I wanna share and, and Alexandria, excuse me, work. So she says that for live participation, she would do small group learning, teacher led instructions, synchronous learning and full group learning. I mean, then for student page, she would do student ll instruction, asynchronous learning and station rotation learning. Like I said, I lived by a playlist and I fire station, my students definitely ran my classroom. Um I felt like they learned the best that way. And so being able to have different near pod lessons going and students working on different sections at their own pace, really, really works well. Um, and I also agree that if you just were playing it in front of the class and you didn't want students to join with the code, you could just, um, have them watch the video. Absolutely. Again, I just wanna show you really quickly if you're not done working, no problem at all. But I do want to show you just one more time how you can share responses with the class while you're in the middle of teaching. So if I hit Angie's work, now your work is going to pause for a second. Now on your screen, you will see Angie's responses because I have shared them to you. I can uns share them and they will go back to your screen. I just wanted to make sure to point that feature out to you one more time. All right. So we've spent time, we are on the end of our session. I know you guys have been with me. It's super early where you are. Um Thank you for bearing with me. We just have a couple of more things that we wanna touch on and one of those things is evidence of learning. So you've spent a lot of time creating your lessons, exploring the activities, right? That's all fine and dandy. But how do I know how well my students did or how much participation. So that's what we're gonna talk about. We're gonna talk about those reports. Now, you can follow along on your live lesson screen or you can look at my screen. If you are on your own screen, you will have to scroll down. Um If you are looking at mine, I will scroll down for you. So we're gonna talk about those post session reports. My favorite part. Ok. So on your the right hand side of your screen, um when you're doing a near pot or when you're on your near pod home screen, you will see a button that says reports and you will click on that and then it will pull up all of the lessons that you have in your library and that you've done for a session. And so let's say we wanna do plant parts in their job. You will then click this down arrow and it will pull up all of the different sessions that you ran for that specific lesson. So for example, for the purpose of explaining um for this plant parts in their job, let's say I did two live participations and I did one student paste. Now, I can see all of the sessions I ran for that lesson, which is really cool. And so if you're running, I know you got teach multiple grade levels, maybe you're teaching the same lesson and some people are doing remediation. Some people are doing acceleration and so you have different groups running the same lesson. Um or let's say you have different periods, you have six blocks or six periods and you need to label those lessons. You can go in and edit the title of the report just to help you keep you organized if the date doesn't work for you. Ok. And so then once you click on the specific report that you want to see, it will pull up all of the students names on the left hand side and all of the activities that students have done across the top. So now I can go in and see, ok, for the poll, it tells me my participation. It tells me 93% of the students participated. If I can see that I did a quiz, it's gonna show me the average score. Um If I did a time to climb, it's gonna show me the average score across the top, draw participation and so on and so forth. Now, if I want to look at an individual student, these check marks are gonna let me know whether they completed that activity or whether they did not, if there's no checkmark and it's just a, just a dash right through. That means that student did not complete the activity. It will also show you what they got individually on that activity. So you're kind of able to gain some data to move forward. Now, what's really cool is you can sort this and filter this by the first um by the first letter of the name that students used to join the lesson. Um And you can see the basic student responses um from the student p lesson in a similar format. OK? So let's say I wanted to figure out specifically, I wanna look at the draw it because I am going to use the draw it activity as a participation grade and I wanna see how many students did it. Um So that can that is gonna tell me that 86% of my students participated and that is going to give you the class average on that activity. So what we would have if we did a poll is it's gonna pull up that pie chart just like we saw a pie chart while we were doing the lesson. You can also view that same pie pie chart at the end of the lesson. Um And you can see individual student responses overall what the class wanted. Um And the average. Now this is my favorite thing and I'm gonna tell you why. It's my favorite thing. Now, if students do a draw at activity, let's say they're labeling or they took a picture of their work or they were highlighting for this activity, they were labeling. Now, I love this because during parent teacher conferences, when parents are like, what exactly did my child do or why did they receive this grade? I can pull up this picture exactly of their work and share it with them. It makes it so easy. I can search for their name. I'm meeting with Adam's mom today. Hey Adam. Hey Adam's mom. This is exactly what Adam did in class this day. This is what his work looks like. This is maybe why he received um whatever grade he got. Um and this is what we're gonna do going forward. I love this feature. I think it is super helpful. So do not feel like, oh my gosh, the students worked on something and then it's gonna disappear after the session ended. No, you can go back and see everything that the students worked on. All right. So this is if they did a time to climb, which is a Gamification activity. If you are gonna be with me later on in our session today, we are gonna go over time to climb up more in detail. Um But it's a super awesome game where students answer quiz questions and then they race to the top of a mountain. My students loved it all of a sudden. They were in love with math as soon as I did time to climb. Um So this will show you the individual student score, how many they got correct. Um And also the amount of points that they have, it'll show you the participation and it'll show you the average score. So we know that if we have the average score, we can kind of tell where the mastery level is in the classroom. Um You can review, review the time to climb by question. Cool thing about time to climb is you can actually pause it in the middle of your session to review. Um But if that's not for you, you can review it after maybe you roll it over to the next day as your opening question or as your review question, if you saw a question that most of the students missed. Um So that's some of those session reports. So now I wanna talk about and I wanna hear from you. How will you transform learning in your classroom? So one of our last few slides is going to be a reflection of next. Next steps. Share with me one thing you learned today about NA POD and just reflect and share on your next steps for implementing NA Pod into your instruction. Also, I can approve student posts for the case of this. I do not need to approve you all because I know everybody in here is an adult. But if it's students and I was worried about something they might say I might leave that approval on collaborating with my team to build more lessons. Yeah, airpod has changed a lot since last year. I'm glad you think so along with the pole and matching sorting by standards time saver uh Robert. I agree. Oh You didn't know anything about Napo. Now you want to use it for all your lessons. That makes me so happy to hear. She, I hope you found it, you know, user friendly and exciting. It was awesome and I will be using it a lot. I am super glad. I think it's awesome too. Like I said, I used it every single day. My students were like, um, at this point N POD is your husband? I will be using this in a small group this year. Yes, small. It's great for that. It's great for that. Teaching new subjects. Good luck teaching your new subjects. You're gonna kill it. Yes, it ha it definitely will make standards, more interest, more, more interesting. Students love the virtual reality, the 3D. They're so into that. Um You would think they're really on a field trip. It definitely changes the game. Yes, NA pod can be adapted for your pre K students. It works for all grade levels, all people. It works for adults. It works in PLC meetings. Um My team used NA Pod during our PLC meetings. It helped kept us organized and it just helped us interact with each other on a different level. Um I learned about the text features. Thank you. I am excited to use near pod this year. Good. I'm glad they got premium for you all. Awesome. Thank you all for sharing. Thank you for adding a GIF or GIF. I don't know how you say everybody says it differently. I appreciate that near pod has lots of diverse options for instruction. I know it's actually mind blowing. I agree. I look forward to engaging more student engagement, encouraging more student engagement with interactive activities. This will work great for her, EL A. Um And the 3D is awesome. Good. I'm glad you guys loved it. I'm super happy. Everybody was able to walk away with at least one thing that really warms my heart. So just putting it all together. Um Just take some time to think about what are your learning goals? What are, what do your students need? Um finding and creating a near pod lesson. You cannot break near pod. There is just tons of explanation to be done, click buttons. Try this, add this practice running through a lesson. Um I promise you cannot break it. It is like uh the teacher's toy even to this day, I'm still finding new things on near pod. I'm still playing with it. Um It's still exciting for me. Um And we also have a resource page where you can find resources, um na pod dot com slash resources. You can also go to na pod dot com slash help. There are tons and tons of youtube videos articles, blog posts, just different ways teachers um and people have integrated NA Pod into their classroom. Um Like I said, if you have any questions, please drop this in the chat. Um And if you wanna stay connected with us, which I hope that you do. We are on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at NA pod and Vocabulary. You can email your questions to support at NA pod dot com. And on your actual NA pod, there's a little um speaking bubble at the bottom of your green. Let's say you're in the middle of a lesson or you're working on one currently and you need to ask a question, quick question. That question is automatically gonna be shot to our support team and you can get um real time feedback on questions that you may have, which I think is super helpful. Let's say you enjoyed today's session so much that you want to become a near pot certified educator. You absolutely can do that and take your learning up an additional notch. I want to let you guys know that we do appreciate your feedback. Um So you can click on this post training evaluation session um and go ahead and select today's training session is getting started. Um And my name is Ashley Bridges. Thank you so so much for joining me. I will also drop the link in the chat. I will be around after this session to answer any other questions that you may have. If you wanted to type something in the chat off script, I will be hanging around if you do not have any questions. Thank you for your feedback and thank you so so much for joining me today. I'm going to drop the um my email as well as the survey in the chat in case you do not click the link and I will be around if anyone has any questions, if not have an awesome rest of your summer and have an amazing school year. If you're gonna be in our session later on, I will see you again. Have a great lunch. Um And I hope you guys gained something today. Thank you so much, Sarah. I really appreciate that. You will receive a copy of a recording of this session today. So if you need to go back and watch some of the examples that I went through, um You absolutely can. You guys were great and amazing. I really appreciate you for hanging with me on this early, early Tuesday morning. Oh, thank you, Jamie. I, I really appreciate that. I'm glad you're excited for the next training, Sherry.

We love to hear nice things. So if you are wanting to see this session again, like I said, you will get the video recording of our session today. Everything we did today, you will get that um at the end in a few days. Oh, thank you, Melissa. I really appreciate that and thank you for the smiley face. Sure. That's fine. That's fine share all of the near pond knowledge that you can. Susan. I'm going to drop the link um, one more time. See you this afternoon, Carissa. Yes, absolutely Suzanne. Thank you so much Angela. Like I said, my email is in the chat. If you have any questions that pop up later while you're working, feel free to email me and I'll definitely support you the best way that I can moving forward. Thank you, Laurie. I appreciate it. If you have, if you are still on here with us and you have any questions and you need to raise your hand or anything like that. Um That is totally fine. Just let me know how I can support you, Suzie. I am so glad that you said that I'm glad that the timing worked out perfectly for you. I know that I talk really, really fast. Probably me being from Pittsburgh. So I'm glad it worked out well for you. Yes. Your el a training session is gonna be amazing tomorrow. Yes, Amy. Absolutely. Reach out to me. I'll be more than happy to help support you in your near pod journey. Thank you so much David. That is so kind. I appreciate that. Like I said, I know that I talk really, really fast. Um I probably need to work on slowing, slowing down as my students used to say. And my mom's like Ashley, why are you talking so fast? So I'm glad that it worked out for you, David. I really appreciate that. Yes, Suzie. I think it's so, so important to feel like you actually walked away from a PD with something because we've all, we all sat in those P DS where they're like, seriously, you wasted my time. I could have been watching Netflix right now. You know. So I'm glad that you actually learned something and walked away, feeling confident in a new, in a new skill. You too, you too, Suzie. Have a good summer. I'm gonna drop the um feedback one more time. If you do not get a chance to fill it out and my email as well. You too, Misty. I see that there's a few more of you on here. Do you all have any questions that I can support you with or anything that I can assist you with? I'm more than happy to help. Um If you haven't had a chance to fill out that feedback survey, I would greatly appreciate if you did that. All right, I'm gonna hang on here for about two more minutes and then I'm gonna close out our webinar for today. Like I said, if you have any questions that did not get answered, please feel free to shoot me an email and I will definitely get back to you um in 24 hours.

Um Amanda. Oh, thank you, Ashley. I like that because your name is Ashley too. I definitely do have a passion for it. I'm glad that that came through. All right, if there are no more questions, I'm gonna go ahead and close this out for today. Thank you so much for attending and I hope you have a great lunch and a great rest of your summer.\"), (1946, 485, 3410, \"Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

I have two of my awesome colleagues here with me today and I wanna make sure that I introduce them before I introduce myself. Um I have Liz Pearce and Tracy Mikos here. They're gonna be helping me with the chat. So if you have any questions at all during our session, you can go ahead and drop them in the chat and one of us will be sure to help support you along the way. Um Again, I am Ashley Bridges. Um I'm coming to you today from Charlotte, North Carolina. Um You could see a little bit about me at the bottom of the screen. Hashtag edition. I'm coming to you from Charlotte, but I am born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which automatically makes me a diehard Steelers fan if you don't like the Steelers, I'm not really sure what to tell you at this point. Um I am ad E I advocate and I love culturally responsive pedagogy. Um I kick box about four times a week. I am a target and Amazon expert, right? Any and all things targeted Amazon. I know all about it. Um I'm an H BC U grad. I am a tea lover. I drink tea every single day, multiple times a day. Um hot and cold and most importantly, I am a teacher at heart. Um I taught sixth grade math and I also taught fourth grade for me personally, I think fourth grade was about my sweet spot. I used near pot all along the way really? Because it made my instruction easier. Um So that's a little bit about me. I hope that you guys enjoyed that first activity. It's really fun. It actually took me a couple of times to get those all correct. Um So that's interesting to see how you guys were able to get them correct as well. So we are gonna go ahead and start if you haven't not had a chance to um load the lesson. I would love for you to go ahead and join our live lesson. That's how you are going to gain the most out of our session today. You can see that I can toggle between the student side and the teacher side. I'm gonna toggle back to the teacher side and I can see that some of you attempted that activity, which is really awesome. Just so, you know, you are here for learning and creating with near pod. So I wanna give you a second to go ahead and read these learning objectives to yourself and then we're gonna talk about them just a bit here. All right. So ultimately, I know that this says a lot of different words, hopefully they mean something to you. They definitely mean something to me. But my goal by the end of today is to give you a dis an additional tool in your toolbox that is going to make your teaching life easier. I know that we have all sat on those PD sessions myself included and we're like, ok, you've given me a task and now it's just made my life harder, right? I want to give you something that is going to free up time and it's going to make your life easier and your students more engaged. So by the end of our session today, you'll be able to launch a near pod, you'll be able to find edit and create your own near pod lesson. Um You're going to be able to really enhance student instruction through engagement. And most importantly, you're gonna be able to receive that data that you need to adapt your instruction. Um Ultimately, your life is gonna be easier. By the end of today. I do want to give you a little caveat here. I'm going to say so many things to you do not feel pressured to have to do them all at once. Take it one step at a time if you only leave today with one thing, hey, that's better than what you came in with, right? Do not have to, you do not have to go in and do all of the things I've shown you today. Just start with one and then build upon that near pot is super user friendly. So it will not be challenging for you to do that at all. All right. So I wanna point out something at the very beginning of our session because this is this is going to be a game changer for you. So on the right hand side of your screen, you will see a little notes tab, it looks like a pen and a paper. This is on your near pod live session. Um And you can click that and you can go ahead and select whether you want the notes from this lesson to be emailed. Um One drive Google Drive, whichever is your preferred method. And that is going to allow you to type notes on each slide and you will receive a copy of every single slide that I go over today, as well as all of the resources I go over. Um Let's say you don't wanna do this right now and you wanna do it halfway through our lesson. That is totally fine. But I wanted to make sure I pointed out this feature so that you can continue your learning um throughout the day, throughout the week and throughout the school year, right? You can go back and reference, what did she say when she brought that up again, right? You can go ahead and reference that this is also something that you can do with your students. Um They can go ahead and get in that habit of taking notes and they'll just be able to look back at your sessions and make sure that they continue their learning experience. Um So if you wanna turn that on, I'll go ahead and give you a minute to do so. Alrighty. So what is near pod? Some of you may know exactly what it is because you use it every day. Some of you are like, I don't even know what you're talking about, right? Um So near pod is a tool that's gonna help you actively engage your students and provide teachers with that real time data. So we're gonna come up with our own definition because I really want you to shape what is near pod to you. I understand that you are the expert in your classroom and that you are gonna shape it to be everything that it is right near pod is not amazing without you. So I want you to create your own working definition of near pot in your head. Um All right. So we are going to watch a video on your side of the screen, you will see eyes up front, right? That means you need to come back to my zoom screen and that's what your students will see. Um I have the option to either do teacher plays or student plays. Um For the sake of this lesson, I'm going to do a teacher plays so you guys can watch it from my zoom. But if you want students to play this video at their own place pace, you can hit student plays. So I'm gonna go ahead and play this video introducing near pod with near pod. You can make every lesson, interactive launch lessons, your students can't wait to join with interactive slides, interactive video Gamification and activities. All right. So now a question is gonna pop up smack dab in the middle of my video, right? This is something that you can do to easily get students engaged in your content. So which of the following ways are you most interested in learning about? Right? What makes you excited to learn about near pod? And you can go ahead and answer that on your screen. Sometimes it takes a second to load. So if you need to reload um your near pod screen to go ahead and answer that question, that would be great. All right. So what's gonna happen here is when we have responses, you're going to be able to share the solution. It is going to be a pie chart, right? And you're going to see what students selected, what answer and you'll be able to see. Ok. Well, my students are excited about Gamification. They're excited about active learning and then you can automatically adjust your instruction to go along with that. So we're gonna continue watching this video as the teacher, you always know where your students are with near pod's formative assessments including polls, open ended questions and more. Get started with what you already have. Add the power of near pod to your existing powerpoints, worksheets, videos, Google slides and other curriculum resources. You love create active video experiences to check for understanding with built in interactive questions, increase engagement with Gamification and activities including time to climb, draw it, drag and drop and more. Get started even faster with our library of premade standard aligned lessons, videos and activities built in partnership with some of your favorite educational brands, use them as is or customized to meet the unique needs of your students. Once you're ready to launch your lesson, choose the teaching mode that works best for your setting. In live participation mode, you control the pace and students participate on their devices in person or virtually in student pa mode. Students move through and participate on their own, working from home or in class in centers stations or groups toggle between live and student p lesson delivery with live to student paste mode to address misconceptions on the fly and differentiate for student needs with front of class mode. You can use near pod without student devices and facilitate collaborative discussions. Your students will love lessons that combine interactive slides, interactive video Gamification and activity. You'll love using insights for more than 20 formative assessments and dynamic media experiences to guide your teaching adapt instruction, differentiate and improve student outcomes. However, you teach, it's in near pod. All right. So now you will see a question on your screen based on what you learned so far. How would you describe near pod to a friend? Um Like I said, if you do not see this question on your live lesson, you may want to reload that screen. So you are able to see the question and then your answers will pop up here on the zoom. So I will give you a few minutes to go ahead and type your response. Mm All right. So we are going to go ahead and move on. Hopefully you are able to submit this question. Let's see. I see that some of it is not loading. So I'm gonna go ahead and reload my screen here. All right. So something that's really awesome about this is I can see this participation percentage on this right hand side, for example, it says 77%. So if I'm in class teaching the students, I'm gonna say, oh, I can see that 77% of you have responded. Where's the rest? Right? You wanna encourage those students to respond. So we can see that Emily here says an interactive lesson platform for students um an interactive learning pool. Um I would describe NA Pod as an interactive lesson format that helps keep students engaged with their learning. Suzanne. That's a really, really great explanation to NA POD. And that's how I would describe it to my friends as well. I also want to point out this feature because while we watch this video, now I can share a response to your screen. So now all of you on your NA pod will be able to see Suzanne's response. So that's really, really great as well to make sure that you're encouraging students to use their voice. Um So like you guys already mentioned, N POT allows for 100% student participation. It allows students to partake in that discussion and gives teachers that formative assessment data. It's great for whole groups and small, small groups. It's great for students working at their own pace. Um If you're anything like me, I lived by a, by a playlist in my classroom. I was like, ok, here's what the students have to do for the next two weeks. I would give it to them after our mini lessons and they'd work through at their own pace. Near pod is great for that. Whether you're doing a whole group instruction, small group and across all different grade levels. So now I want you to participate in this open ended discussion. Think about it. What can happen to learning when every student has the opportunity to participate in every single question. I'm gonna give you a moment to go ahead and answer that. All right. So we have some responses coming in. Um Sherry said every student has the opportunity to learn, right? Even though that sounds like the easiest thing to do, we know as teachers that can be super challenging sometimes. So, yes, absolutely. Um We can see strengths and weaknesses and adjust it for the students in the future, right? I think that is super important right? To be able to adjust our instruction. That's a skill that only teachers have. I feel like um everyone feels like their answers matter if I could like snap to you in person right now, I absolutely would because I think that that student voice is really, really important and it allows students to build that confidence in their own thought process, um better classroom engagement and you have the opportunity uh to make sure everyone understands, I can click this answer. I could tell that hers was a little bit longer um to make sure that everyone understands what is being thought taught. Thank you, Kaitlyn. Students feel included and you can see all over the class how they're grasping the concept, how they're accepting what you're teaching. Are they meeting those learning goals and objectives that you set potential for more engagement, increased overall learning, right? You guys have some really, really awesome responses. Now, with this open ended question, I wanna switch to the student side and I wanna show you guys something. If you take a look at my Zoom screen, you can see what looks like a little book and a speaker phone on the right hand side, this is the coolest integration in my personal opinion, right? Because like we said, we want to make sure that all students are able to learn. There shouldn't be any blogs, any um thing that's getting in the way. So this immersive reader feature definitely takes that up a notch. So let's say you have a student where English is not their first language or they're an ell student, right? We can go ahead and click this book feature, then we have tons of languages to choose from. Um Let's go ahead and uh select Chinese traditional and we are going to translate the whole document that you make. I think that is the coolest thing ever because now no matter where that student is coming from, no matter what experiences they may have at home, they can now participate in the learning, right? It's also great for our younger kids because we can have it, just read it out to them in English. Let's say you wanna make sure students are still getting that rigorous critical thinking skills, but they may be a struggling reader. You can have it, read it out to them. Maybe they struggle with typing on a computer, you can have them record their audio and the teachers still gonna receive all this data in real time. They'll also be able to see it at the end of their lesson, but they can see while students are actively participating in it. So I think that that is a really awesome feature uh to point out and you can select whichever the students will have that option to select that on their computer. They can pick whatever language um they need and they will easily become um adaptive to it. They'll be like, OK, I have to go on here and I have to select my language. It will be no problem for them. So like you guys mentioned when every student has the voice, it's really gonna transform that teaching and that student engagement, right? As a teacher, it is going to allow you the opportunity to check for understanding, check for misconceptions. You're gonna be able to identify who's mastering and who's not mastering content, right? And most importantly, you're going to make sure that you have a diverse group of thoughts and opinions and that is going to encourage those students to use their voice. All right. So one of my favorite features on Nerd is this collaborate board. Um So you guys can go ahead and participate in this um on your screen. How do you currently facilitate conversations? And let's get real for a moment. What are some challenges that you and your students are experiencing during classroom discussions? I'll give you a moment to go ahead and respond. Yeah, students not participating. If you see anything that you agree with or that just resonates with you, you can go ahead and hit that love button. Um That is definitely 100% true. Lack of engagement. The same students always responding. I I could think back. I had this one student, her name was Lacey and she every single time was like my go to student and then she even sometimes got upset whenever I didn't call her. I'm like Lacy, like you cannot be the only one to answer the questions. I'm sure we all have um a student like that. But yeah, this definitely will encourage all students to use their voice. Open ended questions in a virtual school. Many students are camera shy in a group. Oh my goodness. I can think about when I was teaching virtually and you have a bunch of students that like they're there, but they're like ghosts. It's really, really hard to get them engaged. And sometimes as a teacher, it can be difficult to know what they know and what they don't know, students talking over each other. Oh, not balanced. Yeah, that can be really challenging. Lisa said time for everyone to talk or trying to get everyone to participate, right? So those are some challenges that we all face I faced in the classroom. Um challenges that will probably continue for many of teachers, but we wanna make sure that we give you this tool of Napo to hopefully kind of solve some of those basic challenges that we're having. Um Amanda, I really want to rejoice because being in a virtual setting, I find students don't want to ask questions over zoom but platforms like near pod and who allow students to answer without others seeing, right? Students get embarrassed because they're like, oh, what if I'm not? Right. Right. And so sometimes it's hard to encourage them to kind of get over that fear. So that's a great point, Amanda. All right. So we're gonna talk about today just really how to spark those conversations. Um We've already done some of that basically through our session. So you guys participated in an open ended question. That is something easy to do with your students. Typically, they do not have to reload. I don't know what tech issues that I'm having to just bear with me on that front. Um But you can go ahead and add add those open ended questions. So students can automatically explain their thinking, explain their thought. Um The poll that we did at the beginning during the video, you can incorporate those to kind of gauge what their, where students are and what stand they're taking. My personal favorite is the Draw it feature which we're going to talk about next and I am a math person at heart. Um I have taught all subjects, but I like teaching math the most and I really felt like the draw it feature made my math instruction 10 times easier. If you are a math person, you will understand why I'm saying that. So this is an example of the teacher perspective of what the draw it feature looks like. Now on your end, you will see this screen right here. Um It's gonna have a pen, a highlighter, a text box, a picture box and an eraser. These are our learning objectives that we did at the beginning of our session today. And what I like to do is take something that's traditionally a teacher led portion of the lesson and make it a student led portion. So I was one of those teachers that was like, OK, I love annotation. Can you highlight the important words? Can you tell me what you need to pull out of these words on your screen? Now, the students can do that. So if you wanna go ahead and highlight some important things that you think you really wanna gain out of our objectives today. That would be great. You can use the pen. If you click the pin, it changes different colors, the highlighter, you can highlight teaching engagement, whatever makes you happy. And while students work on that, I can see actively see who's participating what they're highlighting. Um If they have not submitted it, it will say in progress and you'll see this yellow. Um If they have hit that submit button at the bottom of their screen, it will turn green. And if it says awaiting drawing, that means they haven't started yet. So that also tells me what and when I'm teaching during class, what students may not be working on what um I'm actively going on so you can scroll down, you can see all of the students and I'm gonna share uh Laurie's because I think that is super cute and everyone needs to spread a little bit of love and something that's really cool about this is I can click this now and if I see an exemplar, I'm like, this is the one my students loved whenever I shared their work and I could hit it. And now on all of your screens, you will see Laurie's work. That is super cool. I love this feature for math because it allows students, students to showcase their work and then I can share it out with all of the other students. Um It also makes it really easy for me to identify common misconceptions when I can see everyone's work on the same page. So I think that that is really cool. The work is 100% anonymous. No one is going to know you can actually um turn off the student name so that let's say you were teaching um via zoom and you didn't want and students were looking at your screen, you don't want them to see whose work is, who's, you can go ahead and turn that off. Um, or you can have it on, whichever works best for you in your classroom. But when you share it out to the students, they will not see whose work it is. And I think that that's super encouraging and super cool. Now, if I go over to the student side, something else that I love to do is we had those like clunky curriculum books that we absolutely had to use. And I'm like, ok, well, how can I change this up? So I would have a picture of whatever um, topic I was teaching, let's say I'm talking about fractions. In this case, students would also have their book in their computer. I would have them click this button right here and they would upload a picture of their work. So now when I go over to the teacher side, I see pictures of all of the students' work. They loved it. I loved it. It made my life a whole lot easier because now I don't have to go on each individual student and see. OK, what did they do? I can just get a full screen picture of where my students are and that was super, super transformative in my instruction. All right. So we're gonna go ahead and do the fun stuff and let's go ahead and get into near pod. Um I want you guys to have the opportunity to actually explore the things that make near pod the best that it is. Um So we are gonna log in. You all are specifically going to log in through Clever. So you are going to go to your district Clever page, click on the NA pod logo and then it will direct you directly to the NA pod home page. Um I did not say this before you wanna open up an additional tab. So right now you will have my Zoom screen my live lesson and then you'll have an additional tab where you log into Napo through Clever. So I'll give you a moment to go ahead and log in. Yes. Once you do click um Christia, once you do click um on someone's work, they will no longer be able to work on it. But that's only if you share it to the whole class. So if I choose not to share it, the students will still be able to work on it. All right. Um If you are logged into your clever, that is great. If you are having issues getting into near pod, please type your first and last name as well as your email in the chat. So we can make sure that we are able to support you with getting in. Um, a couple of people said it's under supplemental supplemental curricula. Yes, Melissa. Um, we're actually going to go over that, which is a really awesome question. Are the students responses saved? They are saved and you are going to be able to look at them later. We're gonna talk about um the end of lesson reports at the end. All right. So if you wanna follow along with me on my zoom screen, maybe you wanna split your screen so you can go at the same time, we're going to explore this near pod library together. So for me on my screen, I'm going to go ahead and click on the left hand side near pod library and then it pulls up this awesome collection of featured lessons. Now, if you're anything like me, I'm gonna have a moment of transparency here. There's some really great things I wanted to teach about but just did not have the time to make those lessons from scratch, right? So that's what these featured lessons are for. They have lessons on Independence Day, promoting inclusion, fostering emotional health, um different sel lesson skills, test prep strategies, things that you do not have to go in and make from scratch but are already there for you. And I think that that's a really great feature, these featured lessons change depending on what time of year it is, what holidays are happening. Um What is happening around the world. This is that opportunity for students to really grow personally and professionally. And I love that additional push, which I'm sure some of you will as well. Um And you will see in the chat um my colleague Liz dropped Tanya's um email. You will need to email Tanya your first and last name. Um and also my colleagues will support you with that. So if you have any questions about your, your near pot or your clever not working, um We'll definitely get that squared away for you. Now, let's talk about the meat, the bread and butter, whatever you wanna call it. This is the best part we are going to go in and filter bystander. So I can go ahead over here to one and I can select a state or common core since you guys are in Oklahoma. I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down to Oklahoma. I'm gonna select math or whatever subject you teach. Then I'm gonna select a grade level which is fourth and then this is the coolest part to me. Then I can select the strand specifically that I'm looking for. So you can use this feature for lessons that you love teaching lessons that you do not like teaching days that you may be absent and you know, you need a quick lesson to give to your students and give to the sub this feature is great for that. Um So for this case, I'm going to use um four a one use multiple representations of patterns to solve real world and mathematical problems. So now it has gone through and filtered fourth grade lessons, activities and videos that go with this standard specifically, right? So you can scroll down, you'll see videos, you'll see premade lessons. Um You'll see activities, you see time to climb, which we'll talk about a little bit later. And so now that is taking the headache out of you finding um a lesson or creating something from scratch. Um For me when I was absent, this is what I use because I know that sub sub plans can be a little bit daunting from time to time, but we know that we want learning to continue on even when we're not there. And sometimes we want that to be something as simple as finding a lesson that is going to make sure my students are engaged and that they're still gaining what they would if I wasn't there. Um So if I go ahead and preview this lesson, um I see what you're saying in the chat, you said I have a search bar but not the drop downs for choosing standards. Ok? We'll go back and talk about the search bar as well. Um So if I were to preview a lesson, for example. Um this is place value and patterns. I think it's always best practice to preview because like we said, you're the expert in your classroom. So you know what's gonna work for your students and what's not gonna work. So you can preview, see the lesson materials, the essential question. It's gonna give you a pacing guys. We, we know this lesson is gonna take about 50 minutes. And so if I feel like, OK, this lesson works for me, I can add it to my lessons. OK? And we're gonna come back to that shortly. Um I wanted to address a question that I saw in the chat. Mine pops up on the left hand side. OK? So we do have a global search bar here at the top. This is a new feature. Um it near pod is slowly rolling it out. So if you do not see the search bar at the top, do not fret, you will have it soon. Um It's just taking a little bit of time, but everyone will get the global search bar at the top and it will move from the left to the top. So if you, like I said, if you wanted to go ahead and click through the near pod library, I'm gonna give you a moment to do that. A couple of minutes. Just click the near pod library on the left hand side and then you can filter it by standards up here on the right. Um And go ahead and select one lesson that you would like to add to your library. I'm gonna give you four minutes to go ahead and select one and play around a bit. If you have any questions, you can drop those in the chat and I'll address those um during this little workshop time. Sure, Angie. Let me go ahead back for you. I'm sorry that I was moving a bit too fast. Um If you wanna hop over to my Zoom screen, I can show you all one more time how to filter this with the standard. So I'm on my home screen and then I clicked near pod library. Um Then I go up here on the right hand side and I hit filter by standard. After I hit filter by standard, it pulls down this little drop down menu. I can hit the standard or the state. I know you guys are in Oklahoma. So I went, I'm gonna scroll down to Oklahoma and then you can select a subject, whatever subject you would like language, arts, math, science or social studies. I'm gonna select math, then I'm going to pick fourth grade and then you can select whichever strand you would like what we have. Um The English language learners program is an additional um program that is purchased. So some of you may um not have some of the global search features like I said near pod is rolling this out slowly. Um So if you do not have it, do not fret, everyone will have it, but I wanted to make sure to show you guys how to kind of access that. So, so I'm on an updated screen. So some of you may not have some of the features that I'm having but do not fret, you will have it. All right. So we are going to go ahead and stop for a second. We're gonna slow down and we're gonna take a look at our home screen. So if you just click that near pod logo, right? So we can scroll down and I see this lesson that I've added from my search. So I have gone ahead and I've added place value and patterns. Now we can, like I said, we can always preview a lesson. It's always best practice to preview. Um Let's say I like this lesson for my students and I wanna hit edit. So now you can go in and you can personalize this lesson. You do not have to start from scratch, but you can personalize this lesson. I would love for you to follow along with me on my zoom screen right now. So you can kind of see how I'm working through this. So I have two buttons here, edit lesson or duplicate lesson. Now, I do not want to have two copies of this lesson. So I'm just gonna hit edit lesson. It's not gonna edit it for the whole near pod community. It is just going to edit it for you personally. So I'm gonna click edit lesson and now it pulls up this lesson on place value and patterns. Um Let's say I see a couple of things that I don't like or there's some language that my students are not used to. I can go click this open ended question here and now I can edit it to fit what my students need. Or if I want to add additional words, I can say, make sure to, to explain um something else that you can do on the screen. That's really, really cool is that you can also add a timer. Now, I was probably the pacing police in my classroom. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe that's not a good thing. But I wanted to make sure my students were prepared for end of grade testing. And I think the pandemic made pacing really challenging for students. They started work, at least my students, they were working really, really slowly. So I like to add a timer and I can go in and say, OK, I know I want my students to work on this for 10 minutes. They should be able to complete it in 10 minutes automatically. Once they get on there, it's going to load that timer, they will be able to see it and it will go for 10 minutes and then it will shut off and they will have to move on to the next question. Um, you do not have to add a timer and obviously that's up to your discretion for me. I did 10 minute math every day to make sure I was keeping those students sharp. But if that's not for you, no problem at all. Ok. How did you get to the box with the lesson? To edit or copy the lesson? So I will go back here for a second. So when I go to my lessons, there's a little box at the bottom right hand or left hand corner, excuse me, that says edit. It looks like a pencil with a box. And then all I do is click edit and then now I can all of a sudden edit this lesson. Hopefully that clears up. Sure, I can show you where the timer is one more time. No problem. So I'm gonna open up this lesson and I'm gonna just scroll down to this open ended question that we were on before the timer is kind of hidden to the right hand side. It'll say add timer and then you can add a timer to that activity. All right. So let's go ahead and we are going to just save and exit this lesson. All right. So you can go back to your zoom screen here for a second. So I wanna talk about something. I wanna give you guys a good amount of workshop time. And so I wanna give you a little bit of information and then I'm gonna allow you to work at your own pace and ask me questions if you have any. So we wanna talk about your resources. But better now, like I said, at the beginning of this lesson or at this session, I wanted to give you tools in your toolbox that make your life easier. Not that add something on top of your plate, that's gonna take you a whole bunch of, of additional time, but that makes your life easier. So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at this very unconventional way of solving a very simple problem. So if you take a look at my zoom screen and follow along with me as we watch this video. Yes, I love how they call this the fun theory. Um because I know ultimately, at the end of the day, we want our students to find learning fun and exciting. So I would love to hear your thoughts on this collaborate board. What did you observe? What remained the same about the stairs and what changed? And how would this apply to resources that you already use in your classroom? I'm glad you guys love that video. It's super great, right? You're like, wow, that's such a good idea. I wanna walk on those stairs too. Christy. Students are more engaged when we make lessons, more engaging. Absolutely. Kimberly. I'm gonna love that message totally agree, multisensory. This is such an awesome thought because I don't think that anybody has said that yet. So I'm glad that you brought that up, Courtney. We can use our materials but make them more engaging. Absolutely. Kimberly, the stairs became interesting and more people wanted to try them. I don't know about you guys. But if I saw stairs that made music, I absolutely would go on them because typically I'm the first person to get on the escalator, especially in New York City. There's so many stairs there. Um, I think I missed the fir first part, but I'm assuming that they had no music, right? So, if you missed the first part of the video, no problem. It was just regular stairs. So basically, let's say they were conduct, conducting a research study to see who takes the escalator over the stairs. And more people took the escalator over the stairs until they made the stairs turn into music, which was super cool. I'd have trouble getting to work, but because I'd be playing on there. Yeah, probably me too. Absolutely. Um, I'm glad you guys enjoyed that video. I think it's a really great way to kind of showcase how you can just make something that's super conventional and turn it into something awesome and exciting for students because even as adults, we like things that are exciting and fun and bring out our inner child and allow us to be expressive. Um, so, absolutely Thank you guys for sharing all of your thoughts. Um Melissa, the stairs were the same size but still used for going from one floor to the other, right? It still solved the same problem. Um The added piano keys made them more fun and engaging as teachers. Um We can look at our own resources and see how to adapt them or make them more engaging. Absolutely correct. Melissa. OK. Some people mentioned jam boards, right? Very collaborate boards are super similar. That's why I love these and I like how you can hit the love button on them to show classmates some love. And I think it also kind of gives students that confidence when other students um like their messages or love their messages. So let's talk about your stairs, right? So your stairs may be a PDF, it may be a powerpoint, it may be a Google Slides. If you were like me, you were a Google Slides person. I did everything on there. Um That was my bread and butter. So that was my stairs. So whatever your stairs may be, whether they're an image, a PDF, we're gonna start with that and we're going to build upon that. So if you follow along with me on my screen, I'm gonna try to go through this fairly slowly here. So I wanna make sure you gain everything. So we're gonna start with the stairs. We're gonna create an engaging lesson using something we already have right. So I'm gonna hit this button right here that says create and on your screen, you'll see that button, create and then you'll see lesson. So I'm gonna go ahead and hit lesson now, I'm brought to this blank screen. Now if you're anything like me, you love organization. So make sure that you title your lessons just to make sure that you can stay organized and follow along and know exactly um what's going on. So once you bring up this screen to create a lesson, you'll hit this button that says upload files. This is where I'm going to choose my stairs now for you, um It may be a Google doc. It may be a powerpoint, it may be a dropbox one drive for this case, I'm going to select Google Drive and I'm going to search for my lesson on sums and differences. OK. This is a quick um powerpoint lesson. I actually used this very lesson a couple of months ago in my classroom and then it'll bring this up. It says would I like to upload it as individual slides or as a PDF viewer? I'm going to hit individual slides for the purpose of this lesson and then you'll see on the bottom it is um processing the file, right. So it is going to make that file fit right into near pod. Now, if you choose to upload a larger file or a powerpoint, that may be 50 slides, it is going to take a little bit longer time because it's going to compress that file to make sure it fits into near pod. Um So it has loaded all six of my slides. Um This is about fluently adding and subtracting multi digit whole numbers, right? I loved this lesson. So this is something I literally use in my classroom. So I am going to give you four minutes to find a lesson of your own and you're just gonna upload it and then we're gonna stop there and we're gonna move on to adding activities to that lesson. If you have any questions during this workshop time, let me know and I'll be sure to address them and I'm setting the timer for four minutes. I'm so excited to hear that you guys found some of those virtual reality lessons. I'm definitely going to touch on that students. Absolutely love that. Um So that's great. Uh Laurie and Ashley, I like your name Ashley by the way. Um So you don't have to input any active codes whenever you launch a lesson, a launch a lesson, which we will do shortly. Um It will automatically generate a code for you. You do not have to do that about 2.5 minutes left to just find a lesson and upload it. Um Angela, I see you said you only have preview. So you have to add a lesson to your library before you have the edit button. So make sure you hit add to library and then go to your library and you'll be able to edit if that is what you are attempting to do. Yeah. So you can absolutely add the slide show and it will keep your slides. Now, you will not have your transition. So if you're someone who likes to swipe it to the left, um up into the right or whatever the case may be, um, you will not have that part available on your screen. It will just take the slides and input it into an airpod. OK. Good Angela. I'm glad you were able to get that figured out. Great. So just about 30 more seconds, I hope you have found a lesson uploaded it and then we're gonna chunk it into the next thing. Um So Jessica, can you clarify your question one more time? Um Are you saying that you only want to import particular slides or you're having difficulty up, difficulty uploading all the slides? All right. So once you have slides now, if keep in mind, if you uploaded a huge powerpoint or a huge document, it may be taking some time to um compress those files to get them loaded into near pot. But here we have my slide and now we're gonna talk about when and why. So I want you to take a second to think about your current lessons and share in this collaborate board when and why you currently ask questions to help guide your instruction. And what does that look like for you in your classroom? If you are able to um switch to that near pod live lesson and do a collaborate board? That would be great. I understand some of you probably are still working on getting things uploaded and we're toggling between a couple of different tabs. So thank you for bearing with me on this morning. Amy says she asked questions periodically to check for understanding. Yes, Christa, either when it doesn't feel like students are grasping the content or a check in, right? You gotta have those built in check ins, right? They tell us a lot as teachers and they help the students feel supported. Devani Devanny. I hope I'm saying your name correctly if I'm not. I am so sorry, please type the correct pronunciation in the chat. Um Checking for understanding. Should I move on or go back and teach a different way that re looping sometimes is really important. Um After a concept has been introduced, um I love check for understanding. I use it every second I possibly could because I really wanted my students to feel like I was catering my learning and my instruction to what they needed. I ask questions to check for understanding and to help keep students en engaged. Absolutely. Misty, exit tickets. I love exit tickets to gauge understanding, to make sure everyone is following and ready to move on. Absolutely. All right. So we have our stairs uploaded into near pod. Now, we're going to enhance our stairs. We're gonna add the music, add the razzle dazzle, add the excitement. Right. So now we're gonna add those activities. Some of those things that you guys already saw were like virtual reality. Um So we're gonna go ahead and, and jazz up our lesson. So if you follow along with me here, I will give you some more workshop time to play with it on your own. Um So that you can make sure that you kind of are grasping and I'll give you an opportunity to ask me some questions in the chat if you have any. So you will see my screen here. This is that same lesson I talked about, about fluently adding and subtracting multi digi numbers. It was just a Google slides, powerpoint, regular dear. OK. So now um I told you guys, I love the draw it feature. So I'm going to start with that. I can click this slide here that I already made in Google slides and I can automatically convert it to a draw it slide. So this is just a warm up question. It's gonna ask me, would you like to create a draw it from this slide? Do you wanna make a copy of that slide and keep the original? I'm gonna say no, I do not need um an original copy. I just want to draw it slide. So I'm gonna hit No. And now I've transformed that page into a draw up page. I'm gonna show you what that looks like. OK. So now I can see that this has become a draw side for me. I told you guys I did 10 minute math every day. So if this is my warm up question, um students will have 10 minutes to complete it. So I'm gonna scroll down, set a timer for 10 minutes. I'm gonna add it. Like I said, that timer is up there in the right hand corner and then if I wanted to add a picture, I could add a picture. I could search Google and upload a file, something else. That's really cool. If I'm absent, I can hit a voice recorder, right. I can now record my voice. Hey, students, I want you to take a moment to complete this 10 minute math activity. I can play it. Hey, students, I want you to take a moment to complete this 10 minute math activity. Let's say I'm absent and I need students to know that I'm still watching. I'm still making sure they're participating or let's say I just need to explain specific instructions to them. I can add that in there as well. Now, when students get to this slide, they will have a drawl, they will be able to annotate, they will be able to have the p and the highlighter, they'll be able to show their work, upload a picture. If they want. So I've taken what was very basic in my Google slides presentation and I've leveled it up with a super easy 12 step. So I'm gonna go ahead and save that. All right. So something else that I can do is I can hit this big button here that said as add content and activities. So I am gonna go ahead and add an activity here. Let's say I wanted to add a open ended question. What are you most ready to learn today? Now, I can kind of gauge what students are feeling. Are they excited? Are they having one of those mundane days? Are they like, OK, it's super early. I don't really feel like doing this now. I can kind of gauge where students are and I can hit save. I've automatically added an open ended um question into my lesson. I can drag this around. Let's say I want to have that at the beginning. I drag it around. Something else that we can go ahead and add is I know that some of you are really, really excited about the collaborate boards and about virtual reality. So I'm gonna go ahead and add a virtual reality field trip. And for me, I'm gonna make it as a brain break field trip. Sometimes you're going through those lessons and students are like, I need a break. This is hard, especially if you're teaching a concept that they've never ever heard of or seen before. And so I'm gonna just take a trip to Greece because why not? It's absolutely beautiful. I have been there and I just want to see it again. Um, if I wanted to preview it to see what it's gonna look like for my students, I can go ahead and preview it and I can hit done. And now it's added that field trip and let's say I wanna add another virtual reality trip. And this time since students are working on sums and differences, I wanna go to a candy store and I'm gonna take them to the candy store, add that virtual reality field trip in the air. And then I'm gonna add a question after that field trip that has them. Say, where do you think you would use sums and differences in a candy store? I'm gonna take that to a collaborate board. How do you think you would use some and different in this candy store? So now students have the opportunity to participate in an active discussion? Ok. So now it took me about five minutes to go ahead and take my regular power points that I uploaded from Google slides and add those additional activities. So I absolutely want to give you all some more workshop time here to go ahead and add at least two activities to your current lesson that you uploaded and just think about how you would get data from those lessons. Um I'll give you a about six minutes. If you have any questions during your workshop time, drop those in the chat. And me and Tracy will try to help make sure those questions get answered for you. Oh, Christy, I love that. That's a great idea. Doing a scavenger hunt for math. Yes, you can. Um, so I see Christy that you ask, can you undo it? So let's say that you are not sure whether you want that activity as a draw or not. You can select the option that says yes, you'll have your original copy and your draw. If you don't want your draw, you can just delete it and you'll still have that slide in there. Your original slide in there. If you have any questions at all while you're doing this workshop time, go ahead and drop them in the chat. No problem, Melissa. Thank you. You can add a voice instruction to the draw it side. Um As you can see on my screen, I've pulled up just an example of the draw it slide that I have. Let me close this on the side and I can hit um audio recording. Sure. Um I can show you how to add the VR Sure. So if you go back to your lesson slide and it should look like this and you can click this button here that says add content and activities and then right here it says, VR Field trip. Hope that helps you out Krista. Great about three more minutes of our workshop time. Yes. So your links will not be active anymore if you are uploading them through near pod. Like if you have converted it to a PDF, um your links will not be active near POT 3D is pretty cool. Um So if you wanted to add an additional activity for students to work on where you can pull up this button where it says content and activities, I believe who had asked this question? Um Angela, um if you go to this button that says web content, you can then add the URL to whatever other page you want to take them to and they will be able to click the URL from their near pod lesson to work on that activity. I hope that answers your question. Sure. If I wanted to add a matching pair, I would type my instructions, hit add pair and then you can add a text or an image and then you, it will match it up like it will say this is the pair and it'll automatically generate on the left hand side, the options for the students and on the right hand side where they should match it to. So for example, um I want to match this my name with the school that I went to. And then all I would have to do is click done. And then if I wanted to have a whole bunch of different pairs similar to the one that we did when we first got on our call today. Um I would just add another pair. All right. Uh Yeah, there is a whole grade level library for matching pairs. Absolutely. So you don't even have to start from scratch. I love that. Um So I hope that you were able to add um reference media, some text, some activities, explore that virtual reality, those 3d, all those cool things that NA Pod has. I hope you were able to add that to your um session. And so I want you to go ahead and switch back to our live lesson and share with me. What activities and content did you add to your lesson? And where do you think they'll fit best? Go ahead and teach me something. Where can I add additional activities and how would they fit into my lessons? I'll give you a couple of minutes to answer that question. Oh, thank you for saying that Suzie. I really appreciate that. I'm glad you had some time, fun time exploring and reminder. What's really cool is from the teacher perspective. I can see as you guys are typing um what you're writing, I can see who's working on um the current content who may be still practicing on the um on the near pod app themselves. Um Alicia, while we um while people are working on this question, I can show you one more time how to change it to a draw it. So if I click the slide, it will say at the top, convert to draw it and I just have to click that button. All right. So if you are finished with that question, you can hit that submit button. If you are still working, that is no problem at all. I just want to show you guys from the teacher perspective. It's really awesome how I can see um what they're doing and what they're typing. Um I can click here right now. You would not be able to see this from the student perspective. But if you are looking at my Zoom screen, you can see what Amber has typed here right here at the beginning of the lesson and how she wants to add discussion boards um on adjectives and adverbs. So students can describe what they see, right? So this is a really awesome way to just get students automatically involved to feel like they're really guiding their own learning experience. No problem Valerie. Um If you just want to follow along, that's no problem at all. So now we're gonna talk about how to transform teaching and learning, right? These are some really cool features that are just one click away that are not gonna cause you a whole bunch of extra effort. So you have three different options here if you're following along on my zoom screen. So you have teacher facilitated independent learning and interactive video. So for example, today I am doing a live participation lesson. So you can see exactly what I see as I click through my slides, that means I'm doing it live. But I also have the opportunity to do student paste and I wanna show you what that looks like on your pod so I can hit save and exit. And so this lesson that I created about songs and differences. Um I have two options. When I hover over it, I can hit live participation or I can hit student pace student paste changes the game. So when I hit student paste, um it tells me about my collaborative boards that they are going to be disabled. If I do student paste, that is fine. So I can hit continue. So then it's gonna bring this up, it is gonna bring up a code and a link. Now you can send this out to your students. You can have a bunch of different student page lessons going on at one time which I think is really cool. Um If I have students that are working on this level, they may be higher up, they may be working on an accelerated lesson. Some students may be working on um remediation and looping back, right? So I can have both of those things going at the same time and I can still get those reports. Um So it will pull up the screen and this option total game changer require student responses and prevent skipping. Now you just spent your hard earned time creating these activities. And the last thing you want your students to do is click through the slides and not do it right. So we can turn that on. Now, students automatically have to watch the whole video or have to respond to the open ended question or do the poll before moving over. So this students from just clicking and say, ok, Miss Bridges, I'm done. Actually, you're not done because you can't do anything. Um And so I love that feature. That's a total game changer, especially teaching remote. Um because now it makes sure that every student is getting the content and sometimes students do not need that choice. And so yeah, I think that's really awesome. Also a cool thing that I wanna show you guys say you're in the middle of a live lesson and you want students to take a second to work independently. I can turn on student paste in the middle of a live lesson. For example, the button is at the bottom of my screen. You guys will not see this because you're not currently in an active live lesson um in your own, but I can turn it on from slide 29 to 31. And students will be able to work at their own pace from slides 29 to 31. And then after my timer goes off and I say, OK, we're gonna come back. I can turn off that student pace mode. So you have two different options to go about student pace there. Um And I like it because you can really shape it to whatever your teaching style is. Um Yeah, I see your question. Let's go back to that. Um So you can click here and it says 29 days remaining. You can adjust the dates when you just click on that calendar button. Hope that helps you out Trina. All right. So now I would love for you guys to do this little drag and drop activity, add labels to how you might use your lesson in the different modes. There's no right or wrong answer. I kind of just wanna know what you guys would do in your classroom. Give you a few minutes to work on that. All right. So I can see some of you are in progress, some of you have submitted already. Um It's super exciting for me to hear how you would integrate um these different methods in your classroom. And so I, I wanna share and, and Alexandria, excuse me, work. So she says that for live participation, she would do small group learning, teacher led instructions, synchronous learning and full group learning. I mean, then for student page, she would do student ll instruction, asynchronous learning and station rotation learning. Like I said, I lived by a playlist and I fire station, my students definitely ran my classroom. Um I felt like they learned the best that way. And so being able to have different near pod lessons going and students working on different sections at their own pace, really, really works well. Um, and I also agree that if you just were playing it in front of the class and you didn't want students to join with the code, you could just, um, have them watch the video. Absolutely. Again, I just wanna show you really quickly if you're not done working, no problem at all. But I do want to show you just one more time how you can share responses with the class while you're in the middle of teaching. So if I hit Angie's work, now your work is going to pause for a second. Now on your screen, you will see Angie's responses because I have shared them to you. I can uns share them and they will go back to your screen. I just wanted to make sure to point that feature out to you one more time. All right. So we've spent time, we are on the end of our session. I know you guys have been with me. It's super early where you are. Um Thank you for bearing with me. We just have a couple of more things that we wanna touch on and one of those things is evidence of learning. So you've spent a lot of time creating your lessons, exploring the activities, right? That's all fine and dandy. But how do I know how well my students did or how much participation. So that's what we're gonna talk about. We're gonna talk about those reports. Now, you can follow along on your live lesson screen or you can look at my screen. If you are on your own screen, you will have to scroll down. Um If you are looking at mine, I will scroll down for you. So we're gonna talk about those post session reports. My favorite part. Ok. So on your the right hand side of your screen, um when you're doing a near pot or when you're on your near pod home screen, you will see a button that says reports and you will click on that and then it will pull up all of the lessons that you have in your library and that you've done for a session. And so let's say we wanna do plant parts in their job. You will then click this down arrow and it will pull up all of the different sessions that you ran for that specific lesson. So for example, for the purpose of explaining um for this plant parts in their job, let's say I did two live participations and I did one student paste. Now, I can see all of the sessions I ran for that lesson, which is really cool. And so if you're running, I know you got teach multiple grade levels, maybe you're teaching the same lesson and some people are doing remediation. Some people are doing acceleration and so you have different groups running the same lesson. Um or let's say you have different periods, you have six blocks or six periods and you need to label those lessons. You can go in and edit the title of the report just to help you keep you organized if the date doesn't work for you. Ok. And so then once you click on the specific report that you want to see, it will pull up all of the students names on the left hand side and all of the activities that students have done across the top. So now I can go in and see, ok, for the poll, it tells me my participation. It tells me 93% of the students participated. If I can see that I did a quiz, it's gonna show me the average score. Um If I did a time to climb, it's gonna show me the average score across the top, draw participation and so on and so forth. Now, if I want to look at an individual student, these check marks are gonna let me know whether they completed that activity or whether they did not, if there's no checkmark and it's just a, just a dash right through. That means that student did not complete the activity. It will also show you what they got individually on that activity. So you're kind of able to gain some data to move forward. Now, what's really cool is you can sort this and filter this by the first um by the first letter of the name that students used to join the lesson. Um And you can see the basic student responses um from the student p lesson in a similar format. OK? So let's say I wanted to figure out specifically, I wanna look at the draw it because I am going to use the draw it activity as a participation grade and I wanna see how many students did it. Um So that can that is gonna tell me that 86% of my students participated and that is going to give you the class average on that activity. So what we would have if we did a poll is it's gonna pull up that pie chart just like we saw a pie chart while we were doing the lesson. You can also view that same pie pie chart at the end of the lesson. Um And you can see individual student responses overall what the class wanted. Um And the average. Now this is my favorite thing and I'm gonna tell you why. It's my favorite thing. Now, if students do a draw at activity, let's say they're labeling or they took a picture of their work or they were highlighting for this activity, they were labeling. Now, I love this because during parent teacher conferences, when parents are like, what exactly did my child do or why did they receive this grade? I can pull up this picture exactly of their work and share it with them. It makes it so easy. I can search for their name. I'm meeting with Adam's mom today. Hey Adam. Hey Adam's mom. This is exactly what Adam did in class this day. This is what his work looks like. This is maybe why he received um whatever grade he got. Um and this is what we're gonna do going forward. I love this feature. I think it is super helpful. So do not feel like, oh my gosh, the students worked on something and then it's gonna disappear after the session ended. No, you can go back and see everything that the students worked on. All right. So this is if they did a time to climb, which is a Gamification activity. If you are gonna be with me later on in our session today, we are gonna go over time to climb up more in detail. Um But it's a super awesome game where students answer quiz questions and then they race to the top of a mountain. My students loved it all of a sudden. They were in love with math as soon as I did time to climb. Um So this will show you the individual student score, how many they got correct. Um And also the amount of points that they have, it'll show you the participation and it'll show you the average score. So we know that if we have the average score, we can kind of tell where the mastery level is in the classroom. Um You can review, review the time to climb by question. Cool thing about time to climb is you can actually pause it in the middle of your session to review. Um But if that's not for you, you can review it after maybe you roll it over to the next day as your opening question or as your review question, if you saw a question that most of the students missed. Um So that's some of those session reports. So now I wanna talk about and I wanna hear from you. How will you transform learning in your classroom? So one of our last few slides is going to be a reflection of next. Next steps. Share with me one thing you learned today about NA POD and just reflect and share on your next steps for implementing NA Pod into your instruction. Also, I can approve student posts for the case of this. I do not need to approve you all because I know everybody in here is an adult. But if it's students and I was worried about something they might say I might leave that approval on collaborating with my team to build more lessons. Yeah, airpod has changed a lot since last year. I'm glad you think so along with the pole and matching sorting by standards time saver uh Robert. I agree. Oh You didn't know anything about Napo. Now you want to use it for all your lessons. That makes me so happy to hear. She, I hope you found it, you know, user friendly and exciting. It was awesome and I will be using it a lot. I am super glad. I think it's awesome too. Like I said, I used it every single day. My students were like, um, at this point N POD is your husband? I will be using this in a small group this year. Yes, small. It's great for that. It's great for that. Teaching new subjects. Good luck teaching your new subjects. You're gonna kill it. Yes, it ha it definitely will make standards, more interest, more, more interesting. Students love the virtual reality, the 3D. They're so into that. Um You would think they're really on a field trip. It definitely changes the game. Yes, NA pod can be adapted for your pre K students. It works for all grade levels, all people. It works for adults. It works in PLC meetings. Um My team used NA Pod during our PLC meetings. It helped kept us organized and it just helped us interact with each other on a different level. Um I learned about the text features. Thank you. I am excited to use near pod this year. Good. I'm glad they got premium for you all. Awesome. Thank you all for sharing. Thank you for adding a GIF or GIF. I don't know how you say everybody says it differently. I appreciate that near pod has lots of diverse options for instruction. I know it's actually mind blowing. I agree. I look forward to engaging more student engagement, encouraging more student engagement with interactive activities. This will work great for her, EL A. Um And the 3D is awesome. Good. I'm glad you guys loved it. I'm super happy. Everybody was able to walk away with at least one thing that really warms my heart. So just putting it all together. Um Just take some time to think about what are your learning goals? What are, what do your students need? Um finding and creating a near pod lesson. You cannot break near pod. There is just tons of explanation to be done, click buttons. Try this, add this practice running through a lesson. Um I promise you cannot break it. It is like uh the teacher's toy even to this day, I'm still finding new things on near pod. I'm still playing with it. Um It's still exciting for me. Um And we also have a resource page where you can find resources, um na pod dot com slash resources. You can also go to na pod dot com slash help. There are tons and tons of youtube videos articles, blog posts, just different ways teachers um and people have integrated NA Pod into their classroom. Um Like I said, if you have any questions, please drop this in the chat. Um And if you wanna stay connected with us, which I hope that you do. We are on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at NA pod and Vocabulary. You can email your questions to support at NA pod dot com. And on your actual NA pod, there's a little um speaking bubble at the bottom of your green. Let's say you're in the middle of a lesson or you're working on one currently and you need to ask a question, quick question. That question is automatically gonna be shot to our support team and you can get um real time feedback on questions that you may have, which I think is super helpful. Let's say you enjoyed today's session so much that you want to become a near pot certified educator. You absolutely can do that and take your learning up an additional notch. I want to let you guys know that we do appreciate your feedback. Um So you can click on this post training evaluation session um and go ahead and select today's training session is getting started. Um And my name is Ashley Bridges. Thank you so so much for joining me. I will also drop the link in the chat. I will be around after this session to answer any other questions that you may have. If you wanted to type something in the chat off script, I will be hanging around if you do not have any questions. Thank you for your feedback and thank you so so much for joining me today. I'm going to drop the um my email as well as the survey in the chat in case you do not click the link and I will be around if anyone has any questions, if not have an awesome rest of your summer and have an amazing school year. If you're gonna be in our session later on, I will see you again. Have a great lunch. Um And I hope you guys gained something today. Thank you so much, Sarah. I really appreciate that. You will receive a copy of a recording of this session today. So if you need to go back and watch some of the examples that I went through, um You absolutely can. You guys were great and amazing. I really appreciate you for hanging with me on this early, early Tuesday morning. Oh, thank you, Jamie. I, I really appreciate that. I'm glad you're excited for the next training, Sherry. Oh, I'm looking forward to seeing you again this afternoon, Angie. Thank you, Dean. That really means a lot. All of your kind words really, really go super far as you know, teachers. We love to hear nice things. So if you are wanting to see this session again, like I said, you will get the video recording of our session today. Everything we did today, you will get that um at the end in a few days. Oh, thank you, Melissa. I really appreciate that and thank you for the smiley face. Sure. That's fine. That's fine share all of the near pond knowledge that you can. Susan. I'm going to drop the link um, one more time. See you this afternoon, Carissa. Yes, absolutely Suzanne. Thank you so much Angela. Like I said, my email is in the chat. If you have any questions that pop up later while you're working, feel free to email me and I'll definitely support you the best way that I can moving forward. Thank you, Laurie. I appreciate it. If you have, if you are still on here with us and you have any questions and you need to raise your hand or anything like that. Um That is totally fine. Just let me know how I can support you, Suzie. I am so glad that you said that I'm glad that the timing worked out perfectly for you. I know that I talk really, really fast. Probably me being from Pittsburgh. So I'm glad it worked out well for you. Yes. Your el a training session is gonna be amazing tomorrow. Yes, Amy. Absolutely. Reach out to me. I'll be more than happy to help support you in your near pod journey. Thank you so much David. That is so kind. I appreciate that. Like I said, I know that I talk really, really fast. Um I probably need to work on slowing, slowing down as my students used to say. And my mom's like Ashley, why are you talking so fast? So I'm glad that it worked out for you, David. I really appreciate that. Yes, Suzie. I think it's so, so important to feel like you actually walked away from a PD with something because we've all, we all sat in those P DS where they're like, seriously, you wasted my time. I could have been watching Netflix right now. You know. So I'm glad that you actually learned something and walked away, feeling confident in a new, in a new skill. You too, you too, Suzie. Have a good summer. I'm gonna drop the um feedback one more time. If you do not get a chance to fill it out and my email as well. You too, Misty. I see that there's a few more of you on here. Do you all have any questions that I can support you with or anything that I can assist you with? I'm more than happy to help. Um If you haven't had a chance to fill out that feedback survey, I would greatly appreciate if you did that. All right, I'm gonna hang on here for about two more minutes and then I'm gonna close out our webinar for today. Like I said, if you have any questions that did not get answered, please feel free to shoot me an email and I will definitely get back to you um in 24 hours. Was there any extra, extra stuff we needed to be counted? Um No, there's nothing additional um on our end that you have to do, we will have a report of the participants. Thank you. Have a great day. Um Amanda. Oh, thank you, Ashley. I like that because your name is Ashley too. I definitely do have a passion for it. I'm glad that that came through. All right, if there are no more questions, I'm gonna go ahead and close this out for today. Thank you so much for attending and I hope you have a great lunch and a great rest of your summer.\"), (2051, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2053, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2054, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (1995, 586, 3736, \"Um So today we're gonna be talking about the forgotten E it is elaboration and how it can affect retention. And it coming from the five E model which um you probably know about. Um, but we're gonna talk a little bit about it so I can get you a review and then we'll talk a little bit more in depth about elaboration right now. I'm going to try to find, let's see, Betsy. There she is. I found her, Betsy. I'm gonna try to make you an alternative post if you would be willing to. Um um you know, let people in, I don't see how I can do that. So maybe not. OK, we'll just keep going. Um So today we are going to talk about the Forgotten E which is out of the five E model. Let me move some things over. I will try my hardest to keep up with chat as well if you say something and I don't see it, please feel free to interrupt me. You're not gonna hurt my feelings if you have anything to pop in and say that's great as well. Um So with that being said, uh my name is Ter Winson. I am the science instructional coach for um Epic here. I've got my email there as well. And um the curriculums I support as an instructional coach is Apex. I am new to that this year. So, uh, learning is going to just continue, I think for however long I'm here. Um, there is a lot to it, but I am learning and I value any, any help that anybody else gives me when we get in office hours. I, I learn as well. So, um generation genius, I'm very, very fond of, again, science instructional coach. I used it in my classroom when I in brick and mortar. Um, and I think it's very valuable if you know the ins and outs of it and how to use it also, uh puzzle and Study island as well. Um So those are the ones I support. If you ever need, need some help with anything. This is the face that we will be emailing with you or talking with you through fresh service. Um Let me see. Ok, that's ok. Uh Becky, we're, we're gonna cruise right along if you need something. Let me know. Um So what we're gonna do today, here's our agenda. Um We are going to first an introduction for some of you. Hope I, I imagine most of you have heard of the Five E model. We're gonna do an introduction and a review. Um So we kind of know the steps and everything of what we're gonna be talking about. Number two, we're gonna find that fourth e and that's kind of the, the, uh the reasoning behind the title is, I feel like we've, we've lost some of that elaboration part and that's how we really get this knowledge. Um And our kids to hang, they can hang on to it. Uh Three, we're gonna talk about how we inspire students to elaborate and that also means how are we going to allow them to elaborate? So not just inspire them, but also allow them that time to do that. And fourth, I've got some resources for elaboration for you. Um And it's not even just for elaboration, there's some resources that you can go in and find out which e or which part of en engage, engage, explore whatever would this task or this strategy help with? And it's so easily laid out. I'm so excited about the resource that we found and learned about yesterday. So I'm gonna share that with you as well. So next, we're going to do just a little bit of uh I got this from Betsy this morning. Hopefully it works because I've never, I've never done it before. But if you will go to, you can either scan that QR code with your phone or you can join at slido dot com and there's no space in between the numbers, there's a 1869264. And the question is what does elaboration look like to you when you, when you think about yourself elaborating or your students elaborating, I'm kinda just looking to see what that looks like for you. So, um, there's the QR code, I'm gonna give you a minute to get in there and then I'll switch over to that screen and we'll see kind of what we have going on there. Hopefully it works. I'm gonna go ahead and go that way and see if it does. It doesn't say I have anybody doing so if you can't get it open, let me know I may be doing it wrong as well. There's one learning more. So on this uh word cloud, the more people that choose that it'll let you choose that too. If that's kind of what you're thinking is you can go in and start to type that and choose that. Um the the ones that are the most chosen or the common uh terms will be larger. So detailed explanation, explaining further process of developing deeper knowledge, learning more, giving more information, new ideas, sharing more knowledge, clarification details. Very good, expanding your view. Um sharing, we not giving more information, enhanced learning, so good, good, some great options there, explaining further, right? So a little more understanding in that great further detail, let's see, give more information, trying to keep up with all the new ones that come on their new ideas, deeper knowledge, great enhanced learning and explaining further? Awesome. OK. So those are some really good ideas. Um, some good terms that we can associate with. Um, elaboration new ideas, right? Ok. I'm gonna go on here. So for our first, our first, uh, topic we're gonna talk about the five E model. Um, and this is a lot of times you see this in science but it's really not science specific. I think that's why I know about it mostly is because I was science teacher. Um but it allows students to understand the concept over time and then they can um they use a, a series of steps or phases, you can call them steps, you can call them phases or whatever you wanna wanna go by. But there are five, it's engage, explore, explain, elaborate, you may also know as extend interchangeable and then evaluate. I think a lot of us are very familiar with the engage part. That's the book part. I'm gonna call it introducing a phenomenon. Um because I'm big on that and we'll talk about that in just a minute. Um And then a little bit about the explorer or explain and then we evaluate and I think a lot, we, we don't spend enough time in this elaboration phase. So that's what I want to talk about today. So we'll go through the five steps, the five phases, just kind of briefly give you some examples and, and then we'll uh get to the elaboration part. So the first phase of the five E model is you're engaged. So this is where you open your lesson and activity, a question or phenomenon. Um So this engages a student, it offers the opportunity for them to share what they already know about the topic. But it also allows you to gauge their prior knowledge as well. And that's very important because they can make those conception or those connections. So that step is likely the most important. First five minutes of your class or instruction is getting that engagement in. Now, I mentioned the word phenomenon if you'd like more information about that or about phenomena. Um I'll, I need to record it. I did a presentation in the spring, but I need to do a recording and I'll add that to our PD library on the IC page on Epic One. And then I just have some resources I can share with you as well if you're interested. Um But for me, I think using a phenomenon is the new book. It's a real world situation um that kids can relate to uh because it happens to them in their everyday lives or they may see it in their everyday lives. So a great tool for this engagement piece um is a Kwl chart. This no want to know and learn chart is a great reflective piece at the end of a lesson or concept that's being taught. So I have both of those linked in the presentation again, I will um put that in the chat for you guys. Um So you guys can have that as well so you can get in here and get some of those links. So engage. Now, I mentioned phenomena. They are occurrences in the natural and human made world that can be observed and cause one to wonder and ask questions. When I see the word wonder. I also think of the strategy. I see, I wonder or I notice I wonder, that's another great engagement piece. So when you get a student to wonder about something that's your engagement that makes them ask questions. And that part goes into our next one which is explore. Um And I really think with our society and the way things are progressing, we don't have our students wandering and asking questions so much as anymore because it's just not engaging in that it doesn't grab their attention. So this is where I think phenomena are important in doing that. We've got to get something that will pull them in and want them to learn about it and make them wonder and ask those questions. So just a couple of a few bullet points on that engage here some things, some questions or some ways to get the conversation going. What do you think the problem is here? How much do you already know about this topic? And that's gonna be very important with inference? And whenever we get into the elaboration part as well. What might be an area of blank that you think would be useful to explore? Um Why do you believe that this, those are all engagement questions that you can use? So, for example, this is my favorite story. Everyone before long is gonna hear it and some of you may have already heard it. I'm pretty sure Betty may have. But um I always tell the French fry story as an example of an observable phenomena that anyone can easily relate to. So my story is I take my kid to mcdonald's and when we come out of mcdonald's, it's kind of a busy street. It's a down slope and sometimes you just kind of got for it to get out of there, you're not gonna make it. So as I'm waiting to get my turn to floor it into traffic and hopefully safely, my kids getting his food out because, you know, they're impatient and the fresh French fries are the best. So he sets the French fries up on the dash and then all of a sudden I get like a free window of like two seconds. If I can pull it, I hold on and we rush to get in there. Um, well, his fries end up in the floor. Of course, he's mad at me. It's not my fault. I tell him it was inertia. So I tell him your fries didn't even move. Really? And he was like, what do you mean? So I tell him how the car moved out from underneath the french fries, they resisted the change in motion. And all of a sudden we're talking about Newton's first law of motion, the law of inertia, the tendency of an object to resist a change in motion. So this is the way I kind of look at that engaging piece is you can just start a conversation, you get them thinking that they're talking about something not school specific, not related to learning anything like that. And then you've already got your hook, you've got your engagement piece. And now we're talking about science. So that's just an example of how that could be a good engagement piece on the next one. So phase two or step two is going to be explored. This is the second phase of the five E model and this allows a student to actively explore a new concept through concrete learning experiences. So it's student center but it incorporates active exploration. So this happens when students grapple with a problem or a phenomenon and describe it in their own words. And again, I think this is where we kind of have a disconnect with our students, not necessarily a disconnect, but something that we are lacking is they don't know how to grapple with a problem um or a phenomenon. And we've got to get that piece back in there that it's OK to struggle, there's power in the struggle you learn from struggling. Um So that's something I think we, we need to work on with our students in science. This can be a hands on experience or experiments in math. You can use manipulatives or other models. Um hands on experiences are not limited to science. You get in there and you cook in the kitchen, you learn about fractions, um measurements and things like that, reading recipes. Um Yes, Delo, I love power in the struggle. If we never struggled, we never learn anything. So if you get it right the first time, what did you really learn? Um So we've got, we've got to learn that it's ok to struggle. Um And sometimes as adults, we forget, we forget that as well. I think we have this instant gratification uh thing going on here. So just as an example, some questions um or how to discuss this with your students. Where do you think is the best place to find out about this? We know the internet. Everyone has the internet. Sometimes it's good to disconnect from that tech. Um What might be a good plan of action? What will you do if something this happens or that happens? You gotta have that second step um in mind. What do you need to find out more about? So you can learn about this? Um How can you be sure that the information you have is accurate? That's another big one between um, Twitter and Twitch is a new one. I, I don't know all of them. Um You know, we, we share things on Facebook about quotes from Abraham Lincoln about the internet and kids will come tell you that in class and you're like, yeah. Um So what's an accurate, what's a good source of information? And then you could explore a better solution to something, things like that. So for an example, exploration, we'll talk about my French fry example that I I gave earlier, you could include Inertia towers or crash test dummies at the hot row level. So as an example here would be an inertia tower and I know this, you can tell is probably a set up in a classroom. They can easily do this at home. Not a big deal you can also use, I was gonna have that set out to show you guys and I don't know, but you get a cup and an index card and a penny and you sit the penny on top of the index card and you flip the index card out from underneath the penny and it falls on the cup. That's a great at home. Hands on uh phenomena that your student can do while. Sorry, I let somebody in here we go while um they're at home, they have the supplies. More than likely you could even get a piece of paper and kind of n the piece of paper out. Um They can get their family involved if they have siblings these are really fun. Inertia towers are really fun and then the crash test dummies with uh anything that rolls really. But if you've got a hot wheels or anything like that, set something on top of it, create a ramp, you know, you can look at it. Does it change with how high my ramp is? What's the angle of my ramp to pull in your math? Um So get them exploring, let them do this hands on. So those are some examples for science for math and this is linked in the presentation. So when you um get that, you can click on this. Um Betsy, not Betsy, I'm sorry, Lida does such amazing work with manipulatives and lower level math. Um And you've probably all seen this but I want you to understand that it it goes with every part of education. This is part of that um second step in the five E model. Uh the 55 E model, I cannot speak to that. So next, um the phase three is going to be the explain and this is where the student attempts to explain what they learned during the explore phase. So the purpose of this is to support students to develop explanations. This is where they draw from those experiences and those observations using representations, they get to verbalize their conceptual understanding or demonstrate new skills or behaviors. So, what we really wanna remember is this is where the students need to explain what they observed or learn, we can explain it to them, but that doesn't show us their level of understanding so we can support them with our formal language. This is where we can possibly address misconceptions because if we wait too far down, those misconceptions are harder to, to break once they've got that really ingrained in there. Um So it provides opportunities for instructors to introduce formal terms, definitions and explanations for concepts, processes, skills or behaviors. So the biggest thing here I think too is making sure that we give our students the opportunity to explain to us and then we can really understand. OK, my student has a great grasp of this concept, the law of inertia. They can, they can explain it not in just one way. They don't just tell me, well, it's when your french fries go on the floor, that's, that's not understanding. We need them to be able to explain it. And so next, um just some little questions, some, some prompts that you could ask. What did you find out about? How did you arrive at your conclusion? How will you be able to tell if these are things getting them to think ahead? What are you following that process or why? Um Why did you take that approach? How is it different from so getting some comparison in there as well? Again, making sure they can truly explain it is what we're looking for in that third step. Oh look, there's the fourth E I found it. It's right there. Fourth E is elaboration so or elaborate. And that's the purpose of what we're doing today. So this is the fourth phase of the five E model and it gives students the space to apply what they have learned. But I think the biggest thing is this allows for a deeper understanding and allows them to cement their knowledge before the evaluation. A lot of times we hit that evaluation part and that's where we find out. Wait a minute, they don't understand this. Um So new experiences, they get deeper and broader understanding of these major concepts. Um They can elaborate and this is where you apply their knowledge and other topics. This is where you can pull in that cross curricular component. Um We talk about Newton's Laws and we talked about how, you know, you're talking about creating a ramp for the angle of the car to see how that changed it or what is the angle of that ramp? We can pull in some math, we can do some measurements and things like that. So it gives students a chance to extend their thinking and transfer their developing knowledge to new situations. It's an opportunity for students to work out misconceptions. And the reason why I underlined workout is again, it's not that piece where you tell them is you need them to actively get in there and have to think like we talked about earlier, you, they need to grapple with it, they need to struggle with it and work it out and that gives them a little more ownership in their learning as well. So some problems about elaboration, what is another possibility? This allows them to open up their thinking. So they're not on that one track of just this one example that we talked about again, French fries. Um It happens in multiple other ways. Um I can think of an example. I wouldn't tell them to try this at home. But the tablecloth trick where you try to pull the table cloth out from underneath the dishes, you gotta have a good table cloth that doesn't have a lot of friction. You don't want a real thick ham, you want light, uh really light dishes, things like that. But again, this is where it's another possibility. How can this be explained in a different way? How is it different from your original thought or idea? This is also where we get those misconceptions and we break those misconceptions and we help them get through that. How can we be sure that this is the best solution and might there be an alternative way of doing this? So those are just some prompts that you could use to discuss to get that elaboration to open. Now, remember we're going through the five ES, we'll get back to the fourth E in just a moment after you elaborate, you will have evaluate So this is both for students and instructors to determine how much learning and understanding has taken place. It's an ongoing diagnostic process that allows the instructor to determine if the learner has obtained understanding of concepts and knowledge. So again, this is where we go back and say, hey, you did a great job. You got this. But I want you to remember, you don't wanna put you, you don't want your evaluation question to be exactly like what your explore your exploration was about or your engagement piece was about. Because if all they again, if all they can tell me is that those French fries landed on the floor because the farming out from underneath them, that doesn't tell me anything other than if they remember my story. The hook is great, but you gotta move past the hook, you gotta move past the phenomenon and ask those hows and those whys. So evaluation and assessment it can occur at all points along the continuum of the instructional process. So it's great to get in there and do you know your exit tickets after each phase? Um get in there and make sure. So you don't have to go back and redo a still. So some of the tools that assist in the diagnostic process process, rubrics, instructor observations, student interviews, portfolios. We've got projects, problem based learning project products. Um PB L is great and it's also great for multi uh cross curricular things. So your questions re evaluate for some prompts. Why does this happen? What are the similarities again? Comparison and contrast? Why are there differences between uh why do you think that this happened? Evidence? What evidence do you have? What research did they do and how would you solve this Real World problem? So um those are the questions on that I did create um Of course, you know, stole create um this little chart that's just easy to look at. We have a traditional model and we have a modern model. Um I notice I wonder or engage we can use that research hands on learning manipulatives for explore and then we can get more into the hows and whys, not just the whats for explain. Um We have to allow for more connections. So we anchor phenomena or I'm sorry, anchor phenomena is the basis of a question or a problem to be solved. So this is where we get down in that elaboration phase. You've got the concept, self connections, the concept, concept, connections, concept, world connections. And then we want to take an anchor phenomena and turn it into an investigative phenomenon. So an anchor phenomenon is again, is the basis of your question. So as an example, um well, first, the anchor phenomena is the basis and then the investigation, the investigative phenomenon is what students observe after they, they've used their um investigating to answer the questions about the anchor phenomenon. It's kind of confusing. So there's an example that I wanted to give you. So for example, an anchor phenomena could be the flooding in New York City. So we make an observation, OK, that gets us, gets us in there. But there's not anything to answer about it. It's our observation of the phenomena. So the investigative phenomenon is the observation of the ground cover that affects the water seepage and how that looks depending on the type of ground cover. So that's when they ask those questions, it drives the teaching and the learning and you have a much more richer context in what the students can learn. So they observe this real world um anchor phenomenon and it gives them the opportunity to explore uh for more individualized investigative phenomena. And you have a increase the chances that they will forge valuable concept to concept concept to world connections. So reflection is our evaluate piece we have to reflect. Um and that lets us go back on that. So you have your anchor phenomena where there's not really a question, but your investigative phenomena is where you get that question. Um And then again, evaluation at the end, um when we reflect the Kwl chart is a great place uh to do that and we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a moment. So we kind of went through, I know that took a little bit of time with the five E. So hopefully, this will, this will be a little more interesting for you if you already knew all about that. So elaboration, um the fourth e and its important. Um So the real question first is do you even fourth the like? But really do you because we know we gotta do all these steps and we do these steps, but do we really take the time and put the work in for these steps? So what do you do in between explaining and evaluating, that's where that is. Do your students truly understand what you're asking of them in that evaluating piece? Um How do we know if we never really gave them the opportunity to apply what they've learned in a meaningful way and this would be that elaboration. So skipping that step doesn't allow your students to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of from 10 and they need that deeper understanding so they can apply that knowledge in a variety of ways as is expected when content is learned and retained. And we're not just covering it to get through the standards. So we cover it in one specific way. It doesn't allow for that deeper understanding whenever they get to where they need to recall that information, we just have rote memorization and that can be discouraging because we have students that feel really great and really confident they answered that question, right? They know why the fries fell on the floor. But then when we get to our testing or our evaluation and we worked it differently when we've used something other than French fries or however we're doing it, they can't, they can't answer it. And I think that's very discouraging. So we have to remember that explaining is allowing the student to do the explaining while you, the teacher facilitates the conversation and guides misconception. So meaningful means that it resonates with them, they can relate to it. So this is allowing that to happen. Couple years, let Lauren in. So the next thing uh so we just got to elaboration. I'm asking you, do you really elaborate? Do you allow that opportunity for those students to have that meaningful connection to what you're talking about? So I know our goal, we've got to get through all these standards, right? We got through all these standards in time too before testing. That's great. But how often do you find yourself scrambling to meet the demands of the standards delivery by February or March? We focus on testing. Does the testing really matter if we haven't ensured our students are knowledgeable in the content and they apply that knowledge? Now again, like I said a while ago, if you ask them about French fries on the dashboard, they can probably answer a question. I can also read all day long and I know rainbows happen because sunlight passes through water droplets in the sky. But can they apply it in other areas? Do they know we can make rainbows even if the sun is not shining, how do we do that? Do they know about prisms? Do they know about those things? So again, do they know about refraction of light? If the goal was to talk about refraction of light and how light bends and we see color spectrum and all that. If we never let them investigate and elaborate and go farther, can they apply that knowledge elsewhere? So it's basically, do they know what they are seeing? Do they know why they are seeing it? And sure you go through the standards? But at what cost? So we know we've got to check off those standards. We've got to get what we did was push through, to get through them to get to the end. What did they actually gain from it? So it's about learning and retaining the knowledge that they have gained. So elaboration is less about reading, watching or introducing new ideas and more about forging the incredibly valuable concept to sell concept to concept and concept to world connections that help tie anchor and investigative phenomena together. Remember our anchor phenomena doesn't have any questions. That's our hook, that's our anchor. That's what gets us looking and observing. But that investigative phenomenon is when we're trying to figure out the hows and whys, we can see the, what we want to know the hows and whys that way. So it's more about getting in there and looking and doing and trying to figure out why that happens. So it's a cognitive learning strategy and it involves the enhancement of information that clarifies or specifies the relationship between information to be learned and in for and related information. So prior knowledge or experience, so we can talk about inference and an analogy, detail, image overall summary of mental construction, anything that is encoding the original content in a different but related way. So and I've got down there, kind of what cognitive learning strategy, it's mental activity aimed at enhancing one's knowledge or skill. So, again, summarizing, outlining concept mapping, creating analogies, generating um elaborations, sub going self questioning, again, struggle get in there and try to figure out why. Um If we struggle, that means we're trying to figure it out and we're working hard on that. So that is kind of the importance of the elaboration what it is. Now, how do we, how do we inspire our students to elaborate? I have a blank slide in here. I'm not sure why. Hopefully that will go away. How we inspire our students to elaborate. Oh, it's because it's a video. That's why. OK. So I have a short video. Oh, let me, let's go on again. Um It's about three minutes. So I'm gonna get that started. Hopefully. Oh If I shared my sound, I'm gonna watch for a thumbs up from somebody and I'm gonna get this start. If it'll come. Technology has not been my friend today. Can you guys hear that? No. OK. Just a sec. Let me see if I can. Sure Sam. OK, let me try again. Elaboration has to do with the fact that creating a broader picture of your knowledge, right? We tend to have knowledge in silos. So creating connection between these silos is very essential to be able to synthesize and analyze real world problems. We want to prepare students to be able to go out in the real world and solve real problems. You can think of elaboration when you're studying is kind of taking your study to the next level. Even when you get a problem, correct, you're asking why or does this make sense? And we want you to do that with your homework while interacting with your homework. This is the kind of thing that students do when you want them to make a connection between one thing they've learned and another thing they've learned or they're learning and elaboration is really what you try to get them to do when they, when they are making the connections between the comments or the the ideas themselves. And collaboration is sort of taking something that you that you think, you know and saying well, if this is true, then this next thing must also be true. And it connects to this other thing that we learned about. In another way. I really like using elaboration for studying because it's really important for me to make connections to different classes and subjects. And I really, it lets me get to know a lot more about the why rather than just memorizing definitions, it really sort of helps them to connect that body of knowledge. I think it's socially constructed. So it happens in a social context, which I think is one of the reasons that we do so much in our classes to try to promote students interacting with each other and talking about ideas. Elaboration helps you explain terms and things that you know, and then it also helps you if you're talking to somebody that's also asking you questions, that helps you know, what you know and what you don't know because if you can explain something really, really well as opposed to explaining something and the person is confused by what you're saying, then you can see that you need more help in that area. One of the questions I would have and, and I think it's a useful thing for a student to think about is, is, am I aware that I'm elaborating quote unquote. Am I aware that I'm sort of using these problem solving techniques? And is it something that I feel comfortable with? And even if for example, it doesn't feel comfortable, I, I think maybe that that's in a way a good sign right now because it means that you're engaging with the problem and finding at least uh you know, you're in the area where the problem has to be solved in some way, even if it's not being solved. And at least for me as a, you know, quote unquote, someone who's trying to make my way in the world professionally in this way. Those are the situations that, that you find every day anyway. Ok. So here's a question. How often have you praised a student for getting a correct answer? But you did not have them elaborate on the answer. I know a lot of times we're in class or, you know, virtually we're in class, but we don't have a lot of time. So we kind of keep moving. But sometimes our students get so focused, focused on the excitement of being correct. But maybe we forget to find out how they came to that correct answer. Did they guess? Did they get lucky? Can they do that again when dealing with the content in another fashion? So this is where the elaboration piece is very important for that is because that allows us to really recognize, ok, they do, they do have it, they've got it down, they can apply it in other areas. Um And then we can move forward this next slide. It looks like I've got it again. There we go. I'm gonna change now. That's fine. So we saw something in the video, the learning pyramid that I thought was very important. Um And just a way to look at where, where we see what we're doing with our students and how much retention happens with that. So the average retention rates, where do you see elaboration in this model? Um You see lecture reading, audiovisual, which that's us teaching our students showing them videos. But then you get that demonstration part, the discussion, the practice doing and the teaching of others. That's where you get that active part of the learning pyramid. Yeah, passive and active. And I love the auditory, the visual and the k kinesthetic parts of this diagram as well. Um So I think we see that 30% 50% 75% and 90% range shows us that's where that elaboration happens. And we get that where those, that content is retained for those students. I do have another video but it's about six minutes long. So I apologize but it's a very good video and I would like for us to watch it. Maybe Souls Charter School in Memphis is a uniquely musical school. Maybe no school. We share our campus with the Stax Museum, which is the only Soul music Museum in the entire world. Our mission is to prepare students to succeed in life and in college through a music enriched environment, our students are like musical fiends. Students come to school, knowing a lot of things and that knowledge can help them learn new things. They'll take something they've learned at home. See it reappear in a math class and then they also see some of those same things happening in their music classes. So they're able to relate what I'm doing in my class to other classes and it clicks so much more I can say, you know, this triangle is just like triangle that you use when you're performing in band and the silence of this is important for the certain sounds that you need to get. So I'm able to kind of make those connections and kids are really like, oh, this kind of building on prior knowledge is called elaboration. Many teachers use it already even if they don't call it that. But what makes for good elaboration? The teachers of souls are going to put the science behind elaboration into practice, testing out the science in their classrooms. Elaboration basically refers to making meaningful associations to a particular concept. So thinking about what other concepts are related to it. Thinking about your prior experience, it's the opposite of just rote memorization where you're just memorizing something and you're never thinking about it. What elaboration does is it increases the number of ways of accessing information. There are a couple of ways of doing that. Number one, relate the new concept to the other parts of the lesson that the student has learned. Number two, connect knowledge, the students bring into the classroom to the new concept. Having students ask lots of why and how questions is a great way to encourage elaboration. We've been reviewing convection currents this week. Somebody get me started. What do we know about convection currents. What information is important for you to have in order to recognize that something is similar, of course, introducing new strategies like having students do more elaboration had its challenges after we met with Doctor Chu the first time I was not a believer in the strategy, I felt stuck. And I was kind of like you don't teach in a middle school in an impoverished neighborhood. I don't know how your strategies are gonna apply. The teacher is in a unique position to know or find out what the students base of knowledge is and create powerful elaborations from this. If they can relate to like a personal experience of theirs, then that's a very powerful way of remembering. And there's the challenge that plagues every classroom time. I want you to read about Newton's Third Law and then answer the corresponding question in your packet. Five minutes go. Time is a constant battle for me in a lot of ways. When your pacing is really, really tight. Those two minutes that you know, a discussion can go over can really throw a wrench in the rest of your plan. A big part of education is teaching them to elaborate on their own so that they're actively thinking about. Where have I seen this before? What does this remind me of, you know, how can I use this information after talking with the researcher? It made me just more aware of providing those opportunities for students to explain or elaborate on their answers. I also began to implement digital interactive notebooks where students are on the computers and they're able to type and explain their thinking a little bit more elaboration really helps with engagement in my classroom. Students are way more willing to talk about it when it's something that they can relate to. We just had a test today and students did really well. I think that has to do a lot with giving them that opportunity to elaborate on their learning. The teachers of souls didn't have to give up their strict routines to find room for elaboration. So a thing that I've implemented is something called a stand and talk. I'm gonna give you one minute to answer these three questions. They stand in the room somewhere and for one minute straight, they have to talk about that topic. I've done a lot of that lately here and I've seen a lot more growth with the students being able to articulate their thinking and just also just take risks with explaining things whether it's right or wrong. I gave them time to discuss as a group and then that group of four or five is presenting their best finding to the whole entire class and that was way more manageable and it flowed really, really easily as well. Prior to this project, I might have thought that in order to fully do elaboration, it would have to be an entire class worth of discussing something and connecting to experiences. Actually, it can be worked in almost every day. It's important to share concepts like elaboration to help teachers be more intentional about the way they design their lessons. So it increases the likelihood of success. There's so much fun with like these rabbit holes conversations and it's where like kids really become invested in things. Elaboration ends up sparking. I think a good amount of inquiry in students if they don't already have it. Elaboration is going to look different in every classroom because every classroom students have their own set of reference points from their city town favorite TV, show and music, of course. So whenever you can let students connect these things to what they're learning by asking lots of how and why questions, the science shows, it's worth the time and effort. It's going to stick better. You think about these concepts and sometimes you sit there in front of your computer like how on earth am I going to get these kids to reach this? And if you think what are my strategies that I have and just even be able to like, oh, you know, we can use here elaboration, it becomes a tool that you can use every day in your classroom. OK. So one thing that, that I loved in that video, she brought up rabbit hole conversations. And I know a lot of times I remember in my classroom, the kids would think they would get me out, get me off topic and I was just talking about nothing but really your rabbit hole conversations is that elaboration that allows you to talk about different ways that what you're learning about applies in other situations. So even if it is a rabbit hole conversation, you're still discussing, you're elaborating. But what about the standards? I know we've got to move on, we've got to move on. But again, it does no good to move on if all we're doing is just trying to cram cram. This is what we're supposed to tell you. We told you we passed the exit ticket. Great. Let's move on. Get that elaboration piece in there because that is what really gets those students to understand the concept asking the how and why questions they understand what they're learning about. Nothing videos I go on. All right. So what does this look like for Epic students? So our model I think is amazing because the students are often in different locations with different experiences, social norms, activities. That's something they mentioned in the video we just watched. Um whenever especially weather, gosh, when we get to weather in the fall and the spring or the winter in the spring, it looks so much different depending on where you're located in the state. So you could have your students talk about or share or write about, take a picture um and see the different things that you're talking about with weather patterns or with the changing leaves or things like that. So it gives another perspective, another outlook a way to elaborate on what other people see and how you can use that in your learning um as a student whenever you don't see the same thing. Um So I think we have a great model for that, for Epic students, the resources for elaboration. I've got some things to share with you, some links to share with you. Um And then I also did go ahead and put the link to the presentation in the chat while the video was playing so you guys can have that. So next, the Kwl chart, I know I know quit with the Kwl chart. It's old and we all know about it. But do you use it? So the reason why we continue to discuss it and bring it up is because it is so simple, but it is so extremely valuable. Um There's nothing wrong with the tried and true. So we got to get back to those basics that work so well. And a Kwl chart is a great graphic organizer to use. Um And we miss out on the elaborated elaborated piece when we fail to a little more time in that middle section, that column, what I want to know. So after the lesson, when you're reviewing, um the organizers spend some time in the middle column, allow your students to continue expanding on that concept or topic or phenomena, whatever you're talking about and make sure they can, they've successfully completed that column just because the lesson didn't cover. It doesn't mean answering that question isn't, isn't important. Remember, we need to meet those students and their understanding of the, of the concepts and the topics. So it's important for their conceptualization. That is the elaboration part. And if they have questions there, we need to have those questions answered because that is how they relate to that content. And that's what we need, we need them to have their own relationship. Um and, and ways to familiarize themselves with it. So it sticks with them. So this is linked to right here um that you can go to and see more about that as well. Some example, strategies I know this um sometimes it's hard to think about things scaffolding um your questions to avoid confusion and frustration. I know whenever we get into that in depth again, you know, or I think students, Children in general struggle with um struggling, right? Power and the struggle grappling with things. So make sure you stack all of your questions. Um for example, start with a simple elaboration question, describe another example of inertia, right? But then you can get a little more complex. So how is inertia related to the second law of motion? You know, you build on it like that. So it's not so overwhelming elaboration can support cross curricular connections. And I imagine I'm gonna be doing a little more work with this in the future if you're interested. So, using elaboration, it's facilitated by the teacher by asking simple questions. How is this similar to what you're learning in math? Remember the triangle from the uh soul school? Um You could talk about the angles in the triangle. My thought was you could talk about waves if we're in science and you're talking about different frequencies um and things like that amplitude, how can we measure that? Um Art, you talk about angles and triangles, you bring that in. So describe a concept or activity from another subject that is related to your activity in class today. Have your students do that see how you can pull it all together because the more they can relate and they can, they can combine it with other, other courses. I think that embeds it and that gives them more um buy in and understanding and then build it, build and nurture a culture of error and collaboration. Another hard point is they don't wanna be wrong, they don't want to be wrong in front of others. And so any true learning experience, we have to actively create a positive learning environment. So um most learning occurs when mistakes are made or you're struggling or you're grappling with a question. So create this culture of error to encourage learning, it's critical. So fault think faulty thinking can be used as a teachable moment that many students can relate to and analyze without embarrassment. And that creates a healthier classroom culture. I've always told students, I've told my son be the person who asked the question because I guarantee you five more people are sitting there and they are completely lost. Someone asked the question. It's OK because that's how we learn and then we're helping others learn. Um So really getting in there and creating that culture in your classroom um with your students. So a couple of exam, well, I mean, I had a little more to say on that. I've got a little time. So for example, on scaffolding students can review two articles on antibiotic resistance, supported by several related activities. They analyze texts, they create visual re um ex repre representations, peer discussions. Um and then they can draw uh connections between the two. So it can be used to encourage student ownership of their learning. And over time they draw connections between academic data, life events, behavior choices and instructional choices. So it really helps just in, in any area whenever we learn to elaborate and then um it can engage otherwise disinterested students. We might, someone might say something that it piques their interest, they may bring up something that others are interested in. Um So we, we've got to connect it to tangible events or memories in students everyday lives. And that's a great way to promote open discussions among students. So it's more important that a student understand why or um how a particular conclusion was reached rather than repeating that conclusion itself. Um So again, you know, I can tell you all day long about the french fries, but we need to relate it in another way. So there's some other strategies I'm gonna talk to you about um cognitive comics. I love this because it pulls in um art. Um And the, these are through the K 20 I've got a site for you. I'm gonna give you, we have the links too. Um But they're, they're kind of little flash cards and it tells you about the strategy gives you a summary. For example, this one, you give them a prompt um or a reading. They can also respond to the concepts in the most unit, most recent unit of instruction. They get a blank comic book template, use it um to do their artwork as little or as much as they want and then they share them or turn them in. And then you've got multiple people representing how they perceived the phenomena or whatever it is that you're working with. And that can help elaborate for other people who maybe didn't see it in that way or don't experience it in that way. So this is linked up here for you guys. Um Whenever you have that, if you wanna take a look at it some other strategies from the K 20 center um The five W Cube ABC graffiti a class anchor charts. Um again, for your artistic students, you can get them anchor charts in there and let them work with those a little bit. Um I do wanna show you this really quickly. This is linked and then all of these are linked as well. But on your instructional strategies from the K 20 sit, it is an amazing tool for everything. You've got five lessons. But what I wanna show you on these that I'm sharing with you in the presentation. For example, here's the five WQ. Um You can read about it, you can click on it. Oh And it's supposed to move it. Let's see. We'll open it up. There we go. And it flips the card over so you can see the group size, you can see the placement and the lesson. This is something that works for. Engage, explore, explain, extend and evaluate the time it takes to complete it the intention or the purpose again, activate prior knowledge, brainstorming, analyzing it's a conversation starter. You can use it in multiple different ways, but you can also click here and it will take you to a larger um presentation on this to where you can download a PDF and it tells you all of these things here related sources. Um So I think it's very valuable. This also flips the card for you. All of these that are in the presentation right here. These don't flip because I dropped them and put them in there, they're just screenshots. Um, but you can get to them up here. Um, I did ABC graffiti and a PD yesterday and it was just really neat to see how, how you can get students thinking about these things. They have to, you pick a topic or your, or your phenomena and for every letter of the alphabet, they have to think of a word. So, if we're talking about inertia, you know, m could be motion, things like that, start and stop or change. Um Something like that. So these were a couple of really great ones, a flat. Um It, I've got some in here for writing as well. Um Let me see. I've got that on the next one. A lot of these go into writing the Bento box was a really cool one. They understand a novel, a historical time period by creating a single image made from different components. So it's similar to the composition of Japanese meals served in compartmentalized boxes. I do want to show you that one really quick because I think it was very um very good. Hopefully this will show me the picture. No, it doesn't. Well, OK, I'll show you in just a moment. Here we go, I think. Um which I know you can go in there and look at them as well. Um There are tons, there's like pages and pages. I got all of these examples on the first two pages. Um So let me go to page two here and just to show you so you can see kind of what it's talking about. Um So remember tools like jam board when you have group work, you can put students on a jam board you give say, you know, student. So and so and so and so you use jam board one and then assign them and they can um talk to each other that way. Here's the Bento Box. It's kind of got a little, it's still not gonna bring up what I want to show you. Um Oh, there's a picture of it right there, I guess I wasn't patient enough. Um So they just make these models to create. So this is a good piece for extension and also um evaluation, things like that. Uh Blackout poetry, again, our el a component card sort works for any of the discipline. I love to claim evidence reasoning test, improve. So we have to certify your thinking. So it scaffolds um for students to use evidence as they formulate and justify their own arguments. So again, it's claim evidence reasoning test and improve. Um It's a great tool as well. So all of these are linked right here. But again, you can get to that resource from clicking this title on the presentation. There are a ton of them to look through and especially when you're going through just that main first slide where you can just click on it and it flips the card for you. You can read a little bit about it, see where it fits with what you're trying to do. I know we call it the five D model, but we all do every bit of it. We engage them, we explore, we explain, we do all of that, but this is just a great way where you have some tools that can help you do that. So your students are engaged um And, and ways for you to make that happen. So that's uh the gist of it. I do have a survey before you hop off. If you don't mind, I will also put the link in the chat. Um It's gonna ask you about uh what title um what's uh what professional development you attended? So I went ahead and put it on the slide. My name is Tara Wins. This is the forgotten. E I think I wanna do more about this type of thing if you're interested, interested. Um So please let me know um and take a moment to complete the survey. They're very valuable to the instructional coach team because we need to know what you want. What you didn't get that? You wish you would have gotten? Was it just a complete flop altogether? What can I do better? I need to know all of those things. So I appreciate your time and taking that uh to fill that out. The link is the link is in the comment and again the QR Code. Um I know it's Friday afternoon before. Well, the kids get a break. We have a break coming soon, but I thank you guys for sticking around this afternoon and joining me if you have any questions or if you wanna stick around um afterwards and ask for any comments or anything. I would love to hear your feedback. Stop my share. Here we go here. This was outstanding. Thank you so much. This is the kind of thing that is cross curricular and it goes deep. Kids need this for so many reasons. I'm I'm a fan and I have been for years. So you teaching us more. And um there may be some folks out there who didn't know a lot about these types of topics. Um And so all of it, man, it was awesome. It was really great. Thank you. I really hope to elaborate on it. I know, I know we all need create and take things, but I think a lot of it just comes down to what are we taking the time to do with our kids? Are we taking the time to do these elaboration pieces? Um and things like that for them to really understand the the content. I think kids um might be fearful at first just my own experiences of, of having those questions. But then they come to love it because they love the challenge of it and it forces them to think in a way that's different. And, um, they really value that. They may be a little fearful at first. That's, but that's ok. That's ok. Right. It is. And it's a hard thing to learn. Um, but like I said, it, it's great whenever, you know, a kid, you know, they ask the question and others are like, I'm so glad you asked that because I had no idea what was, or I didn't understand. So, um I'm really glad you came and enjoyed it and thank you for, for speaking up for sure. And I'll share this with the team. So thank you very much, Tara. I was just gonna talk about how this really raises the rigor. We talk about kids not being able to use critical thinking skills. So the five E model, if you've not ever used the five E model, um it, it, it does require them to think outside the box and to really think critically. Um I know our designers that are working in Epic Ed are working on the Five E model as well and adding that in, into it. So thank you for bringing this today. Yes, absolutely. I maybe I need to do a little more on it and I, we need to get back to that. So we'll look and see how it goes. If you go, I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording. Um That way.\"), (1996, 586, 3736, \"Um So today we're gonna be talking about the forgotten E it is elaboration and how it can affect retention. And it coming from the five E model which um you probably know about. Um, but we're gonna talk a little bit about it so I can get you a review and then we'll talk a little bit more in depth about elaboration right now. I'm going to try to find, let's see, Betsy. There she is. I found her, Betsy. I'm gonna try to make you an alternative post if you would be willing to. Um um you know, let people in, I don't see how I can do that. So maybe not. OK, we'll just keep going. Um So today we are going to talk about the Forgotten E which is out of the five E model. Let me move some things over. I will try my hardest to keep up with chat as well if you say something and I don't see it, please feel free to interrupt me. You're not gonna hurt my feelings if you have anything to pop in and say that's great as well. Um So with that being said, uh my name is Ter Winson. I am the science instructional coach for um Epic here. I've got my email there as well. And um the curriculums I support as an instructional coach is Apex. I am new to that this year. So, uh, learning is going to just continue, I think for however long I'm here. Um, there is a lot to it, but I am learning and I value any, any help that anybody else gives me when we get in office hours. I, I learn as well. So, um generation genius, I'm very, very fond of, again, science instructional coach. I used it in my classroom when I in brick and mortar. Um, and I think it's very valuable if you know the ins and outs of it and how to use it also, uh puzzle and Study island as well. Um So those are the ones I support. If you ever need, need some help with anything. This is the face that we will be emailing with you or talking with you through fresh service. Um Let me see. Ok, that's ok. Uh Becky, we're, we're gonna cruise right along if you need something. Let me know. Um So what we're gonna do today, here's our agenda. Um We are going to first an introduction for some of you. Hope I, I imagine most of you have heard of the Five E model. We're gonna do an introduction and a review. Um So we kind of know the steps and everything of what we're gonna be talking about. Number two, we're gonna find that fourth e and that's kind of the, the, uh the reasoning behind the title is, I feel like we've, we've lost some of that elaboration part and that's how we really get this knowledge. Um And our kids to hang, they can hang on to it. Uh Three, we're gonna talk about how we inspire students to elaborate and that also means how are we going to allow them to elaborate? So not just inspire them, but also allow them that time to do that. And fourth, I've got some resources for elaboration for you. Um And it's not even just for elaboration, there's some resources that you can go in and find out which e or which part of en engage, engage, explore whatever would this task or this strategy help with? And it's so easily laid out. I'm so excited about the resource that we found and learned about yesterday. So I'm gonna share that with you as well. So next, we're going to do just a little bit of uh I got this from Betsy this morning. Hopefully it works because I've never, I've never done it before. But if you will go to, you can either scan that QR code with your phone or you can join at slido dot com and there's no space in between the numbers, there's a 1869264. And the question is what does elaboration look like to you when you, when you think about yourself elaborating or your students elaborating, I'm kinda just looking to see what that looks like for you. So, um, there's the QR code, I'm gonna give you a minute to get in there and then I'll switch over to that screen and we'll see kind of what we have going on there. Hopefully it works. I'm gonna go ahead and go that way and see if it does. It doesn't say I have anybody doing so if you can't get it open, let me know I may be doing it wrong as well. There's one learning more. So on this uh word cloud, the more people that choose that it'll let you choose that too. If that's kind of what you're thinking is you can go in and start to type that and choose that. Um the the ones that are the most chosen or the common uh terms will be larger. So detailed explanation, explaining further process of developing deeper knowledge, learning more, giving more information, new ideas, sharing more knowledge, clarification details. Very good, expanding your view. Um sharing, we not giving more information, enhanced learning, so good, good, some great options there, explaining further, right? So a little more understanding in that great further detail, let's see, give more information, trying to keep up with all the new ones that come on their new ideas, deeper knowledge, great enhanced learning and explaining further? Awesome. OK. So those are some really good ideas. Um, some good terms that we can associate with. Um, elaboration new ideas, right? Ok. I'm gonna go on here. So for our first, our first, uh, topic we're gonna talk about the five E model. Um, and this is a lot of times you see this in science but it's really not science specific. I think that's why I know about it mostly is because I was science teacher. Um but it allows students to understand the concept over time and then they can um they use a, a series of steps or phases, you can call them steps, you can call them phases or whatever you wanna wanna go by. But there are five, it's engage, explore, explain, elaborate, you may also know as extend interchangeable and then evaluate. I think a lot of us are very familiar with the engage part. That's the book part. I'm gonna call it introducing a phenomenon. Um because I'm big on that and we'll talk about that in just a minute. Um And then a little bit about the explorer or explain and then we evaluate and I think a lot, we, we don't spend enough time in this elaboration phase. So that's what I want to talk about today. So we'll go through the five steps, the five phases, just kind of briefly give you some examples and, and then we'll uh get to the elaboration part. So the first phase of the five E model is you're engaged. So this is where you open your lesson and activity, a question or phenomenon. Um So this engages a student, it offers the opportunity for them to share what they already know about the topic. But it also allows you to gauge their prior knowledge as well. And that's very important because they can make those conception or those connections. So that step is likely the most important. First five minutes of your class or instruction is getting that engagement in. Now, I mentioned the word phenomenon if you'd like more information about that or about phenomena. Um I'll, I need to record it. I did a presentation in the spring, but I need to do a recording and I'll add that to our PD library on the IC page on Epic One. And then I just have some resources I can share with you as well if you're interested. Um But for me, I think using a phenomenon is the new book. It's a real world situation um that kids can relate to uh because it happens to them in their everyday lives or they may see it in their everyday lives. So a great tool for this engagement piece um is a Kwl chart. This no want to know and learn chart is a great reflective piece at the end of a lesson or concept that's being taught. So I have both of those linked in the presentation again, I will um put that in the chat for you guys. Um So you guys can have that as well so you can get in here and get some of those links. So engage. Now, I mentioned phenomena. They are occurrences in the natural and human made world that can be observed and cause one to wonder and ask questions. When I see the word wonder. I also think of the strategy. I see, I wonder or I notice I wonder, that's another great engagement piece. So when you get a student to wonder about something that's your engagement that makes them ask questions. And that part goes into our next one which is explore. Um And I really think with our society and the way things are progressing, we don't have our students wandering and asking questions so much as anymore because it's just not engaging in that it doesn't grab their attention. So this is where I think phenomena are important in doing that. We've got to get something that will pull them in and want them to learn about it and make them wonder and ask those questions. So just a couple of a few bullet points on that engage here some things, some questions or some ways to get the conversation going. What do you think the problem is here? How much do you already know about this topic? And that's gonna be very important with inference? And whenever we get into the elaboration part as well. What might be an area of blank that you think would be useful to explore? Um Why do you believe that this, those are all engagement questions that you can use? So, for example, this is my favorite story. Everyone before long is gonna hear it and some of you may have already heard it. I'm pretty sure Betty may have. But um I always tell the French fry story as an example of an observable phenomena that anyone can easily relate to. So my story is I take my kid to mcdonald's and when we come out of mcdonald's, it's kind of a busy street. It's a down slope and sometimes you just kind of got for it to get out of there, you're not gonna make it. So as I'm waiting to get my turn to floor it into traffic and hopefully safely, my kids getting his food out because, you know, they're impatient and the fresh French fries are the best. So he sets the French fries up on the dash and then all of a sudden I get like a free window of like two seconds. If I can pull it, I hold on and we rush to get in there. Um, well, his fries end up in the floor. Of course, he's mad at me. It's not my fault. I tell him it was inertia. So I tell him your fries didn't even move. Really? And he was like, what do you mean? So I tell him how the car moved out from underneath the french fries, they resisted the change in motion. And all of a sudden we're talking about Newton's first law of motion, the law of inertia, the tendency of an object to resist a change in motion. So this is the way I kind of look at that engaging piece is you can just start a conversation, you get them thinking that they're talking about something not school specific, not related to learning anything like that. And then you've already got your hook, you've got your engagement piece. And now we're talking about science. So that's just an example of how that could be a good engagement piece on the next one. So phase two or step two is going to be explored. This is the second phase of the five E model and this allows a student to actively explore a new concept through concrete learning experiences. So it's student center but it incorporates active exploration. So this happens when students grapple with a problem or a phenomenon and describe it in their own words. And again, I think this is where we kind of have a disconnect with our students, not necessarily a disconnect, but something that we are lacking is they don't know how to grapple with a problem um or a phenomenon. And we've got to get that piece back in there that it's OK to struggle, there's power in the struggle you learn from struggling. Um So that's something I think we, we need to work on with our students in science. This can be a hands on experience or experiments in math. You can use manipulatives or other models. Um hands on experiences are not limited to science. You get in there and you cook in the kitchen, you learn about fractions, um measurements and things like that, reading recipes. Um Yes, Delo, I love power in the struggle. If we never struggled, we never learn anything. So if you get it right the first time, what did you really learn? Um So we've got, we've got to learn that it's ok to struggle. Um And sometimes as adults, we forget, we forget that as well. I think we have this instant gratification uh thing going on here. So just as an example, some questions um or how to discuss this with your students. Where do you think is the best place to find out about this? We know the internet. Everyone has the internet. Sometimes it's good to disconnect from that tech. Um What might be a good plan of action? What will you do if something this happens or that happens? You gotta have that second step um in mind. What do you need to find out more about? So you can learn about this? Um How can you be sure that the information you have is accurate? That's another big one between um, Twitter and Twitch is a new one. I, I don't know all of them. Um You know, we, we share things on Facebook about quotes from Abraham Lincoln about the internet and kids will come tell you that in class and you're like, yeah. Um So what's an accurate, what's a good source of information? And then you could explore a better solution to something, things like that. So for an example, exploration, we'll talk about my French fry example that I I gave earlier, you could include Inertia towers or crash test dummies at the hot row level. So as an example here would be an inertia tower and I know this, you can tell is probably a set up in a classroom. They can easily do this at home. Not a big deal you can also use, I was gonna have that set out to show you guys and I don't know, but you get a cup and an index card and a penny and you sit the penny on top of the index card and you flip the index card out from underneath the penny and it falls on the cup. That's a great at home. Hands on uh phenomena that your student can do while. Sorry, I let somebody in here we go while um they're at home, they have the supplies. More than likely you could even get a piece of paper and kind of n the piece of paper out. Um They can get their family involved if they have siblings these are really fun. Inertia towers are really fun and then the crash test dummies with uh anything that rolls really. But if you've got a hot wheels or anything like that, set something on top of it, create a ramp, you know, you can look at it. Does it change with how high my ramp is? What's the angle of my ramp to pull in your math? Um So get them exploring, let them do this hands on. So those are some examples for science for math and this is linked in the presentation. So when you um get that, you can click on this. Um Betsy, not Betsy, I'm sorry, Lida does such amazing work with manipulatives and lower level math. Um And you've probably all seen this but I want you to understand that it it goes with every part of education. This is part of that um second step in the five E model. Uh the 55 E model, I cannot speak to that. So next, um the phase three is going to be the explain and this is where the student attempts to explain what they learned during the explore phase. So the purpose of this is to support students to develop explanations. This is where they draw from those experiences and those observations using representations, they get to verbalize their conceptual understanding or demonstrate new skills or behaviors. So, what we really wanna remember is this is where the students need to explain what they observed or learn, we can explain it to them, but that doesn't show us their level of understanding so we can support them with our formal language. This is where we can possibly address misconceptions because if we wait too far down, those misconceptions are harder to, to break once they've got that really ingrained in there. Um So it provides opportunities for instructors to introduce formal terms, definitions and explanations for concepts, processes, skills or behaviors. So the biggest thing here I think too is making sure that we give our students the opportunity to explain to us and then we can really understand. OK, my student has a great grasp of this concept, the law of inertia. They can, they can explain it not in just one way. They don't just tell me, well, it's when your french fries go on the floor, that's, that's not understanding. We need them to be able to explain it. And so next, um just some little questions, some, some prompts that you could ask. What did you find out about? How did you arrive at your conclusion? How will you be able to tell if these are things getting them to think ahead? What are you following that process or why? Um Why did you take that approach? How is it different from so getting some comparison in there as well? Again, making sure they can truly explain it is what we're looking for in that third step. Oh look, there's the fourth E I found it. It's right there. Fourth E is elaboration so or elaborate. And that's the purpose of what we're doing today. So this is the fourth phase of the five E model and it gives students the space to apply what they have learned. But I think the biggest thing is this allows for a deeper understanding and allows them to cement their knowledge before the evaluation. A lot of times we hit that evaluation part and that's where we find out. Wait a minute, they don't understand this. Um So new experiences, they get deeper and broader understanding of these major concepts. Um They can elaborate and this is where you apply their knowledge and other topics. This is where you can pull in that cross curricular component. Um We talk about Newton's Laws and we talked about how, you know, you're talking about creating a ramp for the angle of the car to see how that changed it or what is the angle of that ramp? We can pull in some math, we can do some measurements and things like that. So it gives students a chance to extend their thinking and transfer their developing knowledge to new situations. It's an opportunity for students to work out misconceptions. And the reason why I underlined workout is again, it's not that piece where you tell them is you need them to actively get in there and have to think like we talked about earlier, you, they need to grapple with it, they need to struggle with it and work it out and that gives them a little more ownership in their learning as well. So some problems about elaboration, what is another possibility? This allows them to open up their thinking. So they're not on that one track of just this one example that we talked about again, French fries. Um It happens in multiple other ways. Um I can think of an example. I wouldn't tell them to try this at home. But the tablecloth trick where you try to pull the table cloth out from underneath the dishes, you gotta have a good table cloth that doesn't have a lot of friction. You don't want a real thick ham, you want light, uh really light dishes, things like that. But again, this is where it's another possibility. How can this be explained in a different way? How is it different from your original thought or idea? This is also where we get those misconceptions and we break those misconceptions and we help them get through that. How can we be sure that this is the best solution and might there be an alternative way of doing this? So those are just some prompts that you could use to discuss to get that elaboration to open. Now, remember we're going through the five ES, we'll get back to the fourth E in just a moment after you elaborate, you will have evaluate So this is both for students and instructors to determine how much learning and understanding has taken place. It's an ongoing diagnostic process that allows the instructor to determine if the learner has obtained understanding of concepts and knowledge. So again, this is where we go back and say, hey, you did a great job. You got this. But I want you to remember, you don't wanna put you, you don't want your evaluation question to be exactly like what your explore your exploration was about or your engagement piece was about. Because if all they again, if all they can tell me is that those French fries landed on the floor because the farming out from underneath them, that doesn't tell me anything other than if they remember my story. The hook is great, but you gotta move past the hook, you gotta move past the phenomenon and ask those hows and those whys. So evaluation and assessment it can occur at all points along the continuum of the instructional process. So it's great to get in there and do you know your exit tickets after each phase? Um get in there and make sure. So you don't have to go back and redo a still. So some of the tools that assist in the diagnostic process process, rubrics, instructor observations, student interviews, portfolios. We've got projects, problem based learning project products. Um PB L is great and it's also great for multi uh cross curricular things. So your questions re evaluate for some prompts. Why does this happen? What are the similarities again? Comparison and contrast? Why are there differences between uh why do you think that this happened? Evidence? What evidence do you have? What research did they do and how would you solve this Real World problem? So um those are the questions on that I did create um Of course, you know, stole create um this little chart that's just easy to look at. We have a traditional model and we have a modern model. Um I notice I wonder or engage we can use that research hands on learning manipulatives for explore and then we can get more into the hows and whys, not just the whats for explain. Um We have to allow for more connections. So we anchor phenomena or I'm sorry, anchor phenomena is the basis of a question or a problem to be solved. So this is where we get down in that elaboration phase. You've got the concept, self connections, the concept, concept, connections, concept, world connections. And then we want to take an anchor phenomena and turn it into an investigative phenomenon. So an anchor phenomenon is again, is the basis of your question. So as an example, um well, first, the anchor phenomena is the basis and then the investigation, the investigative phenomenon is what students observe after they, they've used their um investigating to answer the questions about the anchor phenomenon. It's kind of confusing. So there's an example that I wanted to give you. So for example, an anchor phenomena could be the flooding in New York City. So we make an observation, OK, that gets us, gets us in there. But there's not anything to answer about it. It's our observation of the phenomena. So the investigative phenomenon is the observation of the ground cover that affects the water seepage and how that looks depending on the type of ground cover. So that's when they ask those questions, it drives the teaching and the learning and you have a much more richer context in what the students can learn. So they observe this real world um anchor phenomenon and it gives them the opportunity to explore uh for more individualized investigative phenomena. And you have a increase the chances that they will forge valuable concept to concept concept to world connections. So reflection is our evaluate piece we have to reflect. Um and that lets us go back on that. So you have your anchor phenomena where there's not really a question, but your investigative phenomena is where you get that question. Um And then again, evaluation at the end, um when we reflect the Kwl chart is a great place uh to do that and we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a moment. So we kind of went through, I know that took a little bit of time with the five E. So hopefully, this will, this will be a little more interesting for you if you already knew all about that. So elaboration, um the fourth e and its important. Um So the real question first is do you even fourth the like? But really do you because we know we gotta do all these steps and we do these steps, but do we really take the time and put the work in for these steps? So what do you do in between explaining and evaluating, that's where that is. Do your students truly understand what you're asking of them in that evaluating piece? Um How do we know if we never really gave them the opportunity to apply what they've learned in a meaningful way and this would be that elaboration. So skipping that step doesn't allow your students to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of from 10 and they need that deeper understanding so they can apply that knowledge in a variety of ways as is expected when content is learned and retained. And we're not just covering it to get through the standards. So we cover it in one specific way. It doesn't allow for that deeper understanding whenever they get to where they need to recall that information, we just have rote memorization and that can be discouraging because we have students that feel really great and really confident they answered that question, right? They know why the fries fell on the floor. But then when we get to our testing or our evaluation and we worked it differently when we've used something other than French fries or however we're doing it, they can't, they can't answer it. And I think that's very discouraging. So we have to remember that explaining is allowing the student to do the explaining while you, the teacher facilitates the conversation and guides misconception. So meaningful means that it resonates with them, they can relate to it. So this is allowing that to happen. Couple years, let Lauren in. So the next thing uh so we just got to elaboration. I'm asking you, do you really elaborate? Do you allow that opportunity for those students to have that meaningful connection to what you're talking about? So I know our goal, we've got to get through all these standards, right? We got through all these standards in time too before testing. That's great. But how often do you find yourself scrambling to meet the demands of the standards delivery by February or March? We focus on testing. Does the testing really matter if we haven't ensured our students are knowledgeable in the content and they apply that knowledge? Now again, like I said a while ago, if you ask them about French fries on the dashboard, they can probably answer a question. I can also read all day long and I know rainbows happen because sunlight passes through water droplets in the sky. But can they apply it in other areas? Do they know we can make rainbows even if the sun is not shining, how do we do that? Do they know about prisms? Do they know about those things? So again, do they know about refraction of light? If the goal was to talk about refraction of light and how light bends and we see color spectrum and all that. If we never let them investigate and elaborate and go farther, can they apply that knowledge elsewhere? So it's basically, do they know what they are seeing? Do they know why they are seeing it? And sure you go through the standards? But at what cost? So we know we've got to check off those standards. We've got to get what we did was push through, to get through them to get to the end. What did they actually gain from it? So it's about learning and retaining the knowledge that they have gained. So elaboration is less about reading, watching or introducing new ideas and more about forging the incredibly valuable concept to sell concept to concept and concept to world connections that help tie anchor and investigative phenomena together. Remember our anchor phenomena doesn't have any questions. That's our hook, that's our anchor. That's what gets us looking and observing. But that investigative phenomenon is when we're trying to figure out the hows and whys, we can see the, what we want to know the hows and whys that way. So it's more about getting in there and looking and doing and trying to figure out why that happens. So it's a cognitive learning strategy and it involves the enhancement of information that clarifies or specifies the relationship between information to be learned and in for and related information. So prior knowledge or experience, so we can talk about inference and an analogy, detail, image overall summary of mental construction, anything that is encoding the original content in a different but related way. So and I've got down there, kind of what cognitive learning strategy, it's mental activity aimed at enhancing one's knowledge or skill. So, again, summarizing, outlining concept mapping, creating analogies, generating um elaborations, sub going self questioning, again, struggle get in there and try to figure out why. Um If we struggle, that means we're trying to figure it out and we're working hard on that. So that is kind of the importance of the elaboration what it is. Now, how do we, how do we inspire our students to elaborate? I have a blank slide in here. I'm not sure why. Hopefully that will go away. How we inspire our students to elaborate. Oh, it's because it's a video. That's why. OK. So I have a short video. Oh, let me, let's go on again. Um It's about three minutes. So I'm gonna get that started. Hopefully. Oh If I shared my sound, I'm gonna watch for a thumbs up from somebody and I'm gonna get this start. If it'll come. Technology has not been my friend today. Can you guys hear that? No. OK. Just a sec. Let me see if I can. Sure Sam. OK, let me try again. Elaboration has to do with the fact that creating a broader picture of your knowledge, right? We tend to have knowledge in silos. So creating connection between these silos is very essential to be able to synthesize and analyze real world problems. We want to prepare students to be able to go out in the real world and solve real problems. You can think of elaboration when you're studying is kind of taking your study to the next level. Even when you get a problem, correct, you're asking why or does this make sense? And we want you to do that with your homework while interacting with your homework. This is the kind of thing that students do when you want them to make a connection between one thing they've learned and another thing they've learned or they're learning and elaboration is really what you try to get them to do when they, when they are making the connections between the comments or the the ideas themselves. And collaboration is sort of taking something that you that you think, you know and saying well, if this is true, then this next thing must also be true. And it connects to this other thing that we learned about. In another way. I really like using elaboration for studying because it's really important for me to make connections to different classes and subjects. And I really, it lets me get to know a lot more about the why rather than just memorizing definitions, it really sort of helps them to connect that body of knowledge. I think it's socially constructed. So it happens in a social context, which I think is one of the reasons that we do so much in our classes to try to promote students interacting with each other and talking about ideas. Elaboration helps you explain terms and things that you know, and then it also helps you if you're talking to somebody that's also asking you questions, that helps you know, what you know and what you don't know because if you can explain something really, really well as opposed to explaining something and the person is confused by what you're saying, then you can see that you need more help in that area. One of the questions I would have and, and I think it's a useful thing for a student to think about is, is, am I aware that I'm elaborating quote unquote. Am I aware that I'm sort of using these problem solving techniques? And is it something that I feel comfortable with? And even if for example, it doesn't feel comfortable, I, I think maybe that that's in a way a good sign right now because it means that you're engaging with the problem and finding at least uh you know, you're in the area where the problem has to be solved in some way, even if it's not being solved. And at least for me as a, you know, quote unquote, someone who's trying to make my way in the world professionally in this way. Those are the situations that, that you find every day anyway. Ok. So here's a question. How often have you praised a student for getting a correct answer? But you did not have them elaborate on the answer. I know a lot of times we're in class or, you know, virtually we're in class, but we don't have a lot of time. So we kind of keep moving. But sometimes our students get so focused, focused on the excitement of being correct. But maybe we forget to find out how they came to that correct answer. Did they guess? Did they get lucky? Can they do that again when dealing with the content in another fashion? So this is where the elaboration piece is very important for that is because that allows us to really recognize, ok, they do, they do have it, they've got it down, they can apply it in other areas. Um And then we can move forward this next slide. It looks like I've got it again. There we go. I'm gonna change now. That's fine. So we saw something in the video, the learning pyramid that I thought was very important. Um And just a way to look at where, where we see what we're doing with our students and how much retention happens with that. So the average retention rates, where do you see elaboration in this model? Um You see lecture reading, audiovisual, which that's us teaching our students showing them videos. But then you get that demonstration part, the discussion, the practice doing and the teaching of others. That's where you get that active part of the learning pyramid. Yeah, passive and active. And I love the auditory, the visual and the k kinesthetic parts of this diagram as well. Um So I think we see that 30% 50% 75% and 90% range shows us that's where that elaboration happens. And we get that where those, that content is retained for those students. I do have another video but it's about six minutes long. So I apologize but it's a very good video and I would like for us to watch it. Maybe Souls Charter School in Memphis is a uniquely musical school. Maybe no school. We share our campus with the Stax Museum, which is the only Soul music Museum in the entire world. Our mission is to prepare students to succeed in life and in college through a music enriched environment, our students are like musical fiends. Students come to school, knowing a lot of things and that knowledge can help them learn new things. They'll take something they've learned at home. See it reappear in a math class and then they also see some of those same things happening in their music classes. So they're able to relate what I'm doing in my class to other classes and it clicks so much more I can say, you know, this triangle is just like triangle that you use when you're performing in band and the silence of this is important for the certain sounds that you need to get. So I'm able to kind of make those connections and kids are really like, oh, this kind of building on prior knowledge is called elaboration. Many teachers use it already even if they don't call it that. But what makes for good elaboration? The teachers of souls are going to put the science behind elaboration into practice, testing out the science in their classrooms. Elaboration basically refers to making meaningful associations to a particular concept. So thinking about what other concepts are related to it. Thinking about your prior experience, it's the opposite of just rote memorization where you're just memorizing something and you're never thinking about it. What elaboration does is it increases the number of ways of accessing information. There are a couple of ways of doing that. Number one, relate the new concept to the other parts of the lesson that the student has learned. Number two, connect knowledge, the students bring into the classroom to the new concept. Having students ask lots of why and how questions is a great way to encourage elaboration. We've been reviewing convection currents this week. Somebody get me started. What do we know about convection currents. What information is important for you to have in order to recognize that something is similar, of course, introducing new strategies like having students do more elaboration had its challenges after we met with Doctor Chu the first time I was not a believer in the strategy, I felt stuck. And I was kind of like you don't teach in a middle school in an impoverished neighborhood. I don't know how your strategies are gonna apply. The teacher is in a unique position to know or find out what the students base of knowledge is and create powerful elaborations from this. If they can relate to like a personal experience of theirs, then that's a very powerful way of remembering. And there's the challenge that plagues every classroom time. I want you to read about Newton's Third Law and then answer the corresponding question in your packet. Five minutes go. Time is a constant battle for me in a lot of ways. When your pacing is really, really tight. Those two minutes that you know, a discussion can go over can really throw a wrench in the rest of your plan. A big part of education is teaching them to elaborate on their own so that they're actively thinking about. Where have I seen this before? What does this remind me of, you know, how can I use this information after talking with the researcher? It made me just more aware of providing those opportunities for students to explain or elaborate on their answers. I also began to implement digital interactive notebooks where students are on the computers and they're able to type and explain their thinking a little bit more elaboration really helps with engagement in my classroom. Students are way more willing to talk about it when it's something that they can relate to. We just had a test today and students did really well. I think that has to do a lot with giving them that opportunity to elaborate on their learning. The teachers of souls didn't have to give up their strict routines to find room for elaboration. So a thing that I've implemented is something called a stand and talk. I'm gonna give you one minute to answer these three questions. They stand in the room somewhere and for one minute straight, they have to talk about that topic. I've done a lot of that lately here and I've seen a lot more growth with the students being able to articulate their thinking and just also just take risks with explaining things whether it's right or wrong. I gave them time to discuss as a group and then that group of four or five is presenting their best finding to the whole entire class and that was way more manageable and it flowed really, really easily as well. Prior to this project, I might have thought that in order to fully do elaboration, it would have to be an entire class worth of discussing something and connecting to experiences. Actually, it can be worked in almost every day. It's important to share concepts like elaboration to help teachers be more intentional about the way they design their lessons. So it increases the likelihood of success. There's so much fun with like these rabbit holes conversations and it's where like kids really become invested in things. Elaboration ends up sparking. I think a good amount of inquiry in students if they don't already have it. Elaboration is going to look different in every classroom because every classroom students have their own set of reference points from their city town favorite TV, show and music, of course. So whenever you can let students connect these things to what they're learning by asking lots of how and why questions, the science shows, it's worth the time and effort. It's going to stick better. You think about these concepts and sometimes you sit there in front of your computer like how on earth am I going to get these kids to reach this? And if you think what are my strategies that I have and just even be able to like, oh, you know, we can use here elaboration, it becomes a tool that you can use every day in your classroom. OK. So one thing that, that I loved in that video, she brought up rabbit hole conversations. And I know a lot of times I remember in my classroom, the kids would think they would get me out, get me off topic and I was just talking about nothing but really your rabbit hole conversations is that elaboration that allows you to talk about different ways that what you're learning about applies in other situations. So even if it is a rabbit hole conversation, you're still discussing, you're elaborating. But what about the standards? I know we've got to move on, we've got to move on. But again, it does no good to move on if all we're doing is just trying to cram cram. This is what we're supposed to tell you. We told you we passed the exit ticket. Great. Let's move on. Get that elaboration piece in there because that is what really gets those students to understand the concept asking the how and why questions they understand what they're learning about. Nothing videos I go on. All right. So what does this look like for Epic students? So our model I think is amazing because the students are often in different locations with different experiences, social norms, activities. That's something they mentioned in the video we just watched. Um whenever especially weather, gosh, when we get to weather in the fall and the spring or the winter in the spring, it looks so much different depending on where you're located in the state. So you could have your students talk about or share or write about, take a picture um and see the different things that you're talking about with weather patterns or with the changing leaves or things like that. So it gives another perspective, another outlook a way to elaborate on what other people see and how you can use that in your learning um as a student whenever you don't see the same thing. Um So I think we have a great model for that, for Epic students, the resources for elaboration. I've got some things to share with you, some links to share with you. Um And then I also did go ahead and put the link to the presentation in the chat while the video was playing so you guys can have that. So next, the Kwl chart, I know I know quit with the Kwl chart. It's old and we all know about it. But do you use it? So the reason why we continue to discuss it and bring it up is because it is so simple, but it is so extremely valuable. Um There's nothing wrong with the tried and true. So we got to get back to those basics that work so well. And a Kwl chart is a great graphic organizer to use. Um And we miss out on the elaborated elaborated piece when we fail to a little more time in that middle section, that column, what I want to know. So after the lesson, when you're reviewing, um the organizers spend some time in the middle column, allow your students to continue expanding on that concept or topic or phenomena, whatever you're talking about and make sure they can, they've successfully completed that column just because the lesson didn't cover. It doesn't mean answering that question isn't, isn't important. Remember, we need to meet those students and their understanding of the, of the concepts and the topics. So it's important for their conceptualization. That is the elaboration part. And if they have questions there, we need to have those questions answered because that is how they relate to that content. And that's what we need, we need them to have their own relationship. Um and, and ways to familiarize themselves with it. So it sticks with them. So this is linked to right here um that you can go to and see more about that as well. Some example, strategies I know this um sometimes it's hard to think about things scaffolding um your questions to avoid confusion and frustration. I know whenever we get into that in depth again, you know, or I think students, Children in general struggle with um struggling, right? Power and the struggle grappling with things. So make sure you stack all of your questions. Um for example, start with a simple elaboration question, describe another example of inertia, right? But then you can get a little more complex. So how is inertia related to the second law of motion? You know, you build on it like that. So it's not so overwhelming elaboration can support cross curricular connections. And I imagine I'm gonna be doing a little more work with this in the future if you're interested. So, using elaboration, it's facilitated by the teacher by asking simple questions. How is this similar to what you're learning in math? Remember the triangle from the uh soul school? Um You could talk about the angles in the triangle. My thought was you could talk about waves if we're in science and you're talking about different frequencies um and things like that amplitude, how can we measure that? Um Art, you talk about angles and triangles, you bring that in. So describe a concept or activity from another subject that is related to your activity in class today. Have your students do that see how you can pull it all together because the more they can relate and they can, they can combine it with other, other courses. I think that embeds it and that gives them more um buy in and understanding and then build it, build and nurture a culture of error and collaboration. Another hard point is they don't wanna be wrong, they don't want to be wrong in front of others. And so any true learning experience, we have to actively create a positive learning environment. So um most learning occurs when mistakes are made or you're struggling or you're grappling with a question. So create this culture of error to encourage learning, it's critical. So fault think faulty thinking can be used as a teachable moment that many students can relate to and analyze without embarrassment. And that creates a healthier classroom culture. I've always told students, I've told my son be the person who asked the question because I guarantee you five more people are sitting there and they are completely lost. Someone asked the question. It's OK because that's how we learn and then we're helping others learn. Um So really getting in there and creating that culture in your classroom um with your students. So a couple of exam, well, I mean, I had a little more to say on that. I've got a little time. So for example, on scaffolding students can review two articles on antibiotic resistance, supported by several related activities. They analyze texts, they create visual re um ex repre representations, peer discussions. Um and then they can draw uh connections between the two. So it can be used to encourage student ownership of their learning. And over time they draw connections between academic data, life events, behavior choices and instructional choices. So it really helps just in, in any area whenever we learn to elaborate and then um it can engage otherwise disinterested students. We might, someone might say something that it piques their interest, they may bring up something that others are interested in. Um So we, we've got to connect it to tangible events or memories in students everyday lives. And that's a great way to promote open discussions among students. So it's more important that a student understand why or um how a particular conclusion was reached rather than repeating that conclusion itself. Um So again, you know, I can tell you all day long about the french fries, but we need to relate it in another way. So there's some other strategies I'm gonna talk to you about um cognitive comics. I love this because it pulls in um art. Um And the, these are through the K 20 I've got a site for you. I'm gonna give you, we have the links too. Um But they're, they're kind of little flash cards and it tells you about the strategy gives you a summary. For example, this one, you give them a prompt um or a reading. They can also respond to the concepts in the most unit, most recent unit of instruction. They get a blank comic book template, use it um to do their artwork as little or as much as they want and then they share them or turn them in. And then you've got multiple people representing how they perceived the phenomena or whatever it is that you're working with. And that can help elaborate for other people who maybe didn't see it in that way or don't experience it in that way. So this is linked up here for you guys. Um Whenever you have that, if you wanna take a look at it some other strategies from the K 20 center um The five W Cube ABC graffiti a class anchor charts. Um again, for your artistic students, you can get them anchor charts in there and let them work with those a little bit. Um I do wanna show you this really quickly. This is linked and then all of these are linked as well. But on your instructional strategies from the K 20 sit, it is an amazing tool for everything. You've got five lessons. But what I wanna show you on these that I'm sharing with you in the presentation. For example, here's the five WQ. Um You can read about it, you can click on it. Oh And it's supposed to move it. Let's see. We'll open it up. There we go. And it flips the card over so you can see the group size, you can see the placement and the lesson. This is something that works for. Engage, explore, explain, extend and evaluate the time it takes to complete it the intention or the purpose again, activate prior knowledge, brainstorming, analyzing it's a conversation starter. You can use it in multiple different ways, but you can also click here and it will take you to a larger um presentation on this to where you can download a PDF and it tells you all of these things here related sources. Um So I think it's very valuable. This also flips the card for you. All of these that are in the presentation right here. These don't flip because I dropped them and put them in there, they're just screenshots. Um, but you can get to them up here. Um, I did ABC graffiti and a PD yesterday and it was just really neat to see how, how you can get students thinking about these things. They have to, you pick a topic or your, or your phenomena and for every letter of the alphabet, they have to think of a word. So, if we're talking about inertia, you know, m could be motion, things like that, start and stop or change. Um Something like that. So these were a couple of really great ones, a flat. Um It, I've got some in here for writing as well. Um Let me see. I've got that on the next one. A lot of these go into writing the Bento box was a really cool one. They understand a novel, a historical time period by creating a single image made from different components. So it's similar to the composition of Japanese meals served in compartmentalized boxes. I do want to show you that one really quick because I think it was very um very good. Hopefully this will show me the picture. No, it doesn't. Well, OK, I'll show you in just a moment. Here we go, I think. Um which I know you can go in there and look at them as well. Um There are tons, there's like pages and pages. I got all of these examples on the first two pages. Um So let me go to page two here and just to show you so you can see kind of what it's talking about. Um So remember tools like jam board when you have group work, you can put students on a jam board you give say, you know, student. So and so and so and so you use jam board one and then assign them and they can um talk to each other that way. Here's the Bento Box. It's kind of got a little, it's still not gonna bring up what I want to show you. Um Oh, there's a picture of it right there, I guess I wasn't patient enough. Um So they just make these models to create. So this is a good piece for extension and also um evaluation, things like that. Uh Blackout poetry, again, our el a component card sort works for any of the discipline. I love to claim evidence reasoning test, improve. So we have to certify your thinking. So it scaffolds um for students to use evidence as they formulate and justify their own arguments. So again, it's claim evidence reasoning test and improve. Um It's a great tool as well. So all of these are linked right here. But again, you can get to that resource from clicking this title on the presentation. There are a ton of them to look through and especially when you're going through just that main first slide where you can just click on it and it flips the card for you. You can read a little bit about it, see where it fits with what you're trying to do. I know we call it the five D model, but we all do every bit of it. We engage them, we explore, we explain, we do all of that, but this is just a great way where you have some tools that can help you do that. So your students are engaged um And, and ways for you to make that happen. So that's uh the gist of it. I do have a survey before you hop off. If you don't mind, I will also put the link in the chat. Um It's gonna ask you about uh what title um what's uh what professional development you attended? So I went ahead and put it on the slide. My name is Tara Wins. This is the forgotten. E I think I wanna do more about this type of thing if you're interested, interested. Um So please let me know um and take a moment to complete the survey. They're very valuable to the instructional coach team because we need to know what you want. What you didn't get that? You wish you would have gotten? Was it just a complete flop altogether? What can I do better? I need to know all of those things. So I appreciate your time and taking that uh to fill that out. The link is the link is in the comment and again the QR Code. Um I know it's Friday afternoon before. Well, the kids get a break. We have a break coming soon, but I thank you guys for sticking around this afternoon and joining me if you have any questions or if you wanna stick around um afterwards and ask for any comments or anything. I would love to hear your feedback. Stop my share. Here we go here. This was outstanding. Thank you so much. This is the kind of thing that is cross curricular and it goes deep. Kids need this for so many reasons. I'm I'm a fan and I have been for years. So you teaching us more. And um there may be some folks out there who didn't know a lot about these types of topics. Um And so all of it, man, it was awesome. It was really great. Thank you. I really hope to elaborate on it. I know, I know we all need create and take things, but I think a lot of it just comes down to what are we taking the time to do with our kids? Are we taking the time to do these elaboration pieces? Um and things like that for them to really understand the the content. I think kids um might be fearful at first just my own experiences of, of having those questions. But then they come to love it because they love the challenge of it and it forces them to think in a way that's different. And, um, they really value that. They may be a little fearful at first. That's, but that's ok. That's ok. Right. It is. And it's a hard thing to learn. Um, but like I said, it, it's great whenever, you know, a kid, you know, they ask the question and others are like, I'm so glad you asked that because I had no idea what was, or I didn't understand. So, um I'm really glad you came and enjoyed it and thank you for, for speaking up for sure. And I'll share this with the team. So thank you very much, Tara. I was just gonna talk about how this really raises the rigor. We talk about kids not being able to use critical thinking skills. So the five E model, if you've not ever used the five E model, um it, it, it does require them to think outside the box and to really think critically. Um I know our designers that are working in Epic Ed are working on the Five E model as well and adding that in, into it. So thank you for bringing this today. Yes, absolutely. I maybe I need to do a little more on it and I, we need to get back to that. So we'll look and see how it goes. If you go, I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording. Um That way.\"), (1997, 709, 4594, 'вћІAfter a Suicide:\\nA Toolkit for SchoolsAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 1\\nThis document was created by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention/Suicide \\nPrevention Resource Center Workgroup:\\nJoanne L.

Faced with students struggling to cope and \\na community struggling to respond, schools need reliable information, practical tools, and \\npragmatic guidance.\\nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and the Suicide Prevention Resource \\nCenter (SPRC), two of the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations, have collaborated \\nto produce this toolkit to assist schools in the aftermath of a suicide (or other death) in the \\nschool community. Both organizations have often been contacted by schools in the aftermath \\nof a suicide death. Because neither AFSP nor SPRC have the capacity to provide customized \\ntechnical assistance in these circumstances, this toolkit was created to help schools determine \\nwhat to do, when, and how. It is a highly practical resource for schools facing real-time crises. \\nWhile designed specifically to address the aftermath of suicide, schools will find it useful \\nfollowing other deaths as well.\\nThe toolkit reflects consensus recommendations developed in consultation with a diverse group \\nof national experts, including school-based personnel, clinicians, researchers, and crisis response \\nprofessionals. It incorporates relevant existing material and research findings as well as references, \\ntemplates, and links to additional information and assistance. It is not, however, intended to be a \\ncomprehensive curriculum. For more resources, see Additional Information . \\nAfter a Suicide: A T oolkit for Schools  includes an overview of key considerations, general guidelines \\nfor action, doвЂ™s and donвЂ™ts, templates, and sample materials, all in an easily accessible format \\napplicable to diverse populations and communities. Principles that have guided the development \\nof the toolkit include the following: \\nвЂў Schools should strive to treat all student deaths in the same way. Having one approach for a \\n student who dies of cancer (for example) and another for a student who dies by suicide   \\n reinforces the unfortunate stigma that still surrounds suicide and may be deeply and unfairly   \\n painful to the deceased studentвЂ™s family and close friends.\\nвЂў At the same time, schools should be aware that adolescents are vulnerable to the risk of suicide \\n contagion. It is important not to inadvertently simplify, glamorize, or romanticize the student   \\n or his/her death.\\nвЂў Schools should emphasize that the student who died by suicide was likely struggling with a\\n mental disorder, such as depression or anxiety, that can cause substantial psychological pain   \\n but may not have been apparent to others (or that may have shown as behavior problems or   \\n substance abuse).\\nвЂў Help is available for any student who may be struggling with mental health issues or \\n suicidal feelings.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 17\\nSpecific areas addressed in the toolkit are listed below:  \\nCrisis Response\\nA suicide death in a school community requires implementing a coordinated crisis response to \\nassist staff, students, and families who are impacted by the death and to restore an environment \\nfocused on education. Whether or not there is a Crisis Response Plan already in place, the toolkit \\ncontains information that can be used to initiate a coordinated response once the basic facts \\nabout the death have been obtained. Included are a Team LeaderвЂ™s Checklist (who does what), \\ntalking points for use with students, staff, parents, and the media; sample handouts; meeting \\nguidelines; and links to additional resources. \\nHelping Students Cope \\nMost adolescents have mastered basic skills that allow them to handle strong emotions \\nencountered day to day, but these skills may be challenged in the face of a school suicide. \\nMoreover, adolescence marks a time of increased risk for difficulties with emotional regulation, \\ngiven the intensification of responses that come with puberty and the structural changes in \\nthe brain that occur during this developmental period. Schools should provide students with \\nappropriate opportunities to express their emotions and identify strategies for managing them, so \\nthat the school can return to its primary focus of education.\\nWorking with the Community\\nBecause schools exist within the context of a larger community, it is important that in the \\naftermath of a suicide (or other death) the school administrative team establish and maintain open \\nlines of communication with community partners such as the coroner/medical examiner, police \\ndepartment, mayorвЂ™s office, funeral director, clergy, and mental health professionals. Even in those \\nrealms where the school may have limited authority (such as the funeral), a collaborative approach \\nallows for the sharing of important information and coordination of strategies. A coordinated \\napproach can be especially critical when the suicide receives a great deal of media coverage and \\nwhen the community is looking to the school for guidance, support, answers, and leadership. \\nMemorialization \\nSchool communities often wish to memorialize a student who has died, reflecting a basic human \\ndesire to remember those we have lost. It can be challenging for schools to strike a comfortable \\nbalance between compassionately meeting the needs of distraught students while preserving the \\nability of the school to fulfill its primary purpose of education. In the case of suicide, schools \\nmust also consider how to appropriately memorialize the student who has died without risking \\nsuicide contagion among those surviving students who may themselves be at risk. It is very \\nimportant that schools strive to treat all deaths in the same way.\\nSocial Media\\nSocial media such as texting, Facebook, and T witter are rapidly becoming the primary means of \\ncommunication for people of all ages, especially youth. While these communications generally take \\nplace outside of school (and may therefore fall outside of the schoolвЂ™s control or jurisdiction), they \\ncan nevertheless be utilized as part of the schoolвЂ™s response after a studentвЂ™s suicide. By working in AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 18\\nвћћpartnership with key students to identify and monitor the relevant social networking sites, schools can \\nstrategically use social media to share prevention-oriented safe messaging, offer support to students \\nwho may be struggling to cope, and identify and respond to students who could be at risk themselves.\\nSuicide Contagion\\nContagion is the process by which one suicide may contribute to another. In fact, in some \\ncases suicide(s) can even follow the death of a student from other causes, such as an accident. \\nAlthough contagion is comparatively rare (accounting for between 1 percent and 5 percent \\nof all suicide deaths annually), adolescents appear to be more susceptible to imitative suicide \\nthan adults, largely because they may identify more readily with the behavior and qualities \\nof their peers. If there appears to be contagion, school administrators should consider taking \\nadditional steps beyond the basic crisis response, including stepping up efforts to identify other \\nstudents who may be at heightened risk of suicide, collaborating with community partners in a \\ncoordinated suicide prevention effort, and possibly bringing in outside experts.\\nBringing in Outside Help\\nSchool crisis team members should remain mindful of their own limitations and consider \\nbringing in trained trauma responders from other school districts or local mental health centers \\nto help them as needed.  \\nGoing Forward\\nIn the ensuing months, schools may wish to consider implementing suicide awareness programs \\nto educate teachers, other school personnel, and students themselves about the causes of suicidal \\nbehavior in young people and to identify those who may be at risk.\\nAdditional Information*\\nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and others .

If the cause of death has not been confirmed to \\nbe suicide, if there is an ongoing investigation, or if the family does not want the cause of death \\ndisclosed, it can be challenging for a school to determine how to proceed.\\nConfirm the Cause of Death\\nThe schoolвЂ™s principal or superintendent should first check with the coroner and/or the medical \\nexaminerвЂ™s office (or, if necessary, local law enforcement) to ascertain the official cause of death. \\nIf the death has been ruled a suicide, the school can proceed to communicate as described in the \\ncrisis response  section.\\nIf the Cause of Death Is Unconfirmed\\nIf the body has not yet been recovered or if there is an ongoing investigation, schools should \\nstate that the cause of death is still being determined and that additional information will be \\nforthcoming once it has been confirmed. Acknowledge that there are rumors (which are often \\ninaccurate), and remind students that rumors can be deeply hurtful and unfair to the missing/\\ndeceased person, their family, and their friends.\\nIf there is an ongoing investigation, schools should check with local law enforcement before \\nspeaking about the death with students who may need to be interviewed by the authorities.\\nIf the Family Does Not Want the Cause of Death Disclosed\\nWhile the fact that a student has died may be disclosed immediately, information about the \\ncause of death should not be disclosed to students until the family has been consulted. If the \\ndeath has been declared a suicide but the family does not want it disclosed, someone from \\nthe administration or counseling staff who has a good relationship with the family should be \\ndesignated to contact them to explain that students are already talking about the death amongst \\nthemselves, and that having adults in the school community talk to students about suicide and \\nits causes can help keep students safe.\\nIf the family refuses to permit disclosure, schools can state, вЂњThe family has requested that \\ninformation about the cause of death not be shared at this timeвЂќ  and can nevertheless use the \\nopportunity to talk with students about the phenomenon of suicide: вЂњWe know there has been \\na lot of talk about whether this was a suicide death.  Since the subject of suicide has been raised, \\nwe want to take this opportunity to give you accurate information about suicide in general, ways to \\nprevent it, and how to get help if you or someone you know is feeling depressed or may be suicidal.вЂќвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 110\\nCrisis Response\\nOnce a suicide death has been confirmed, the school should immediately implement a \\ncoordinated crisis response in order to effectively manage the situation, provide opportunities for \\ngrief support, maintain an environment focused on normal educational activities, help students \\ncope with their feelings, and minimize the risk of suicide contagion . What follows can be used \\nby any school, regardless of whether there is a pre-existing Crisis Response Plan in place. \\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe Crisis Response Team Leader (usually the school psychologist or counselor) has overall \\nresponsibility for the duration of the crisis. She or he should immediately assemble a Crisis \\nResponse Team, which will be responsible for implementing the various elements of the  \\ncrisis response.\\nThe Crisis Response T eam should be composed of at least five or six (but no more than 15) people \\nchosen for their skills, credentials, and ability to work compassionately and effectively under \\npressureвЂ”ideally a combination of administrators, counselors, social workers, psychologists, \\nnurses, and/or school resource officers. It can also be useful to include a member of the schoolвЂ™s \\ninformation technology or computer lab staff.\\nThe Crisis Response Team Leader should designate one individual as the Team Coordinator.\\nCrisis Response Team LeaderвЂ™s Checklist\\nвЂў Inform the school superintendent of the death.\\nвЂў Contact the deceasedвЂ™s family to offer condolences, inquire what the school can do to assist,   \\n discuss what students should be told, and inquire about funeral arrangements.\\nвЂў Call an immediate meeting of the Crisis Response Team to assign responsibilities.\\nвЂў Establish a plan to immediately notify faculty and staff of the death via the schoolвЂ™s crisis alert   \\n system (usually phone or e-mail).\\nвЂў Schedule an initial all-staff meeting  as soon as possible (ideally before school starts in the   \\n morning).\\nвЂў Arrange for students to be notified of the death in small groups such as homerooms \\n or advisories (not by overhead announcement or in a large assembly) and disseminate a  \\n death notification statement for students  to homeroom teachers, advisors, or others    \\n leading those groups. \\nвЂў Draft and disseminate a death notification statement for parents .\\nвЂў Disseminate handouts on Facts About Suicide and Mental Disorders in Adolescents  \\n and Talking About Suicide  to faculty.\\nвЂў Speak with school superintendent and Crisis Response Team Coordinator throughout \\n the day. \\nвЂў Determine whether additional grief counselors, crisis responders, or other resources may be   \\n needed from outside the school.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 111\\nTeam CoordinatorвЂ™s Checklist\\nThe tasks below may be delegated as appropriate to specific staff or faculty in the school.  \\nвЂў Conduct initial all-staff meeting .\\nвЂў Conduct periodic meetings for the Crisis Response Team members.\\nвЂў Monitor activities throughout school, making sure teachers, staff, and Crisis Response Team  \\n members have adequate support and resources.\\nвЂў Plan parent meeting  if necessary.  \\nвЂў Assign roles and responsibilities to Crisis Response Team members in the areas of Safety,  \\n Operations, Community Liaisons, Funeral, Media Relations, and Social Media.\\nSafety\\nвЂў Keep to regular school hours.\\nвЂў Ensure that students follow established dismissal procedures.\\nвЂў Call on school resource officers or plant manager to assist parents and others who may show  \\n up at the school and to keep media off of school grounds.\\nвЂў Pay attention to students who are having particular difficulty, including those who may be  \\n congregating in hallways and bathrooms, and encourage them to talk with counselors or  \\n other appropriate school personnel.\\nOperations\\nвЂў Assign a staff or faculty member to follow the deceased studentвЂ™s schedule to monitor peer  \\n reactions and answer questions.\\nвЂў If possible, arrange for several substitute teachers or вЂњfloatersвЂќ from other schools within \\n the district to be on hand in the building in case teachers need to take time out of  \\n their classrooms.\\nвЂў Arrange for crisis counseling rooms for staff and students.\\nвЂў Provide tissues and water throughout the building and arrange for food for faculty and \\n crisis counselors.\\nвЂў Work with administration, faculty, and counselors to identify individuals who may be having  \\n particular difficulty, such as family members, close friends, and teammates; those who had  \\n difficulties with the deceased; those who may have witnessed the death; and students known  \\n to have depression or prior suicidality; and work with school counseling staff to develop plans  \\n to provide psychological first aid to them.\\nвЂў Prepare to track and respond to student and/or family requests for memorialization .\\nCommunity Liaisons\\nвЂў Several Team members will be needed, each serving as the primary contact \\n for working with community  partners of various types, including:\\n вќЌ coroner/medical examiner , to ensure accuracy of information disseminated to \\n  school community\\n вќЌ police , as necessary, to ensure student safetyAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 112\\n вќЌ mayorвЂ™s office and local government , to facilitate community-wide response to the \\n  suicide death\\n вќЌ mental health and medical communities , as well as grief support organizations, to plan for  \\n  service needs\\n вќЌ arranging for outside trauma responders  and briefing them as they arrive on scene\\nFuneral\\nвЂў Communicate with the funeral director  about logistics, including the need for crisis   \\n counselors and/or security to be present at the funeral.

The key \\nsuicide risk factor is an undiagnosed, untreated, or ineffectively treated mental disorder. Research shows \\nthat over 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental disorder at the time of their death.\\nIn teens, the mental disorders most closely linked to suicide risk are major depressive disorder, bipolar \\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance use disorder, and eating disorders. \\nWhile in some cases these disorders may be precipitated by environmental stressors, they can also occur \\nas a result of changes in brain chemistry, even in the absence of an identifiable or obvious вЂњreason.вЂќ\\nSuicide is almost always complicated. In addition to the underlying disorders listed above, suicide \\nrisk can be affected by personality factors such as impulsivity, aggression, and hopelessness. Moreover, \\nsuicide risk can also be exacerbated by stressful life circumstances such as a history of childhood physical \\nand/or sexual abuse; death, divorce, or other trauma in the family; persistent serious family conflict; \\ntraumatic breakups of romantic relationships; trouble with the law; school failures and other major \\ndisappointments; and bullying, harassment, or victimization by peers.  \\nIt is important to remember that the vast majority of teens who experience even very stressful life \\nevents do not become suicidal. In some cases, such experiences can be a catalyst for suicidal behavior in \\nteens who are already struggling with depression or other mental health problems. In others, traumatic \\nexperiences (such as prolonged bullying) can precipitate depression, anxiety, abuse of alcohol or drugs, \\nor another mental disorder, which can increase suicide risk. Conversely, existing mental disorders may \\nalso lead to stressful life experiences such as family conflict, social isolation, relationship breakups, or \\nschool failures, which may exacerbate the underlying illness and in turn increase suicide risk.\\nWarning Signs of Suicide\\nThese signs may mean someone is at risk for suicide. Risk is greater if a behavior is new or has recently \\nincreased in frequency or intensity, and if it seems related to a painful event, loss, or change.\\nвЂў Talking about wanting to die or kill oneself\\nвЂў Looking for ways to kill oneself, such as searching online or buying a gun\\nвЂў Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live\\nвЂў Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain\\nвЂў Talking about being a burden to others\\nвЂў Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs\\nвЂў Acting anxious or agitated, or behaving recklessly\\nвЂў Sleeping too little or too much\\nвЂў Withdrawing or feeling isolated\\nвЂў Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge\\nвЂў Displaying extreme mood swings вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 1\\nWhat to Do in a Crisis\\nTake any threat or talk about suicide seriously. Start by telling the person that you are concerned. DonвЂ™t \\nbe afraid to ask whether she or he is considering suicide or has a plan or method in mind. Resist the \\ntemptation to argue the person out of suicide by saying, вЂњYou have so much to live forвЂќ or вЂњYour suicide \\nwill hurt your family and friends.вЂќ Instead, seek professional help.\\nIn an acute crisis:\\nвЂў Call 911.\\nвЂў Do not leave the person alone.\\nвЂў If safe to do so, remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs, or sharp objects that could be used.\\nвЂў Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\\nвЂў Take the person to an emergency room or walk-in clinic at a psychiatric hospital.\\nSymptoms of Mental Disorders Associated with Suicide Risk\\nMost adults are not trained to recognize signs of serious mental disorders in teens, and symptoms are \\ntherefore often misinterpreted or attributed to normal adolescent mood swings, laziness, poor attitude, \\nor immaturity. Diagnosis of a mental disorder should always be made by a qualified mental  \\nhealth professional. \\nThe key symptoms of major depressive disorder  in teens are sad, depressed, angry, or irritable mood and \\nlack of interest or pleasure in activities the teen used to enjoy, lasting at least two weeks. Symptoms \\nrepresent a clear change from the personвЂ™s normal behavior and may include changes in appetite or sleep, \\nfeelings of worthlessness/guilt, inability to concentrate, slowed or agitated movement, recurrent thoughts \\nof death or suicide, fatigue/loss of energy, and self-harm behavior.\\nSometimes referred to as manic depression, bipolar disorder  includes alternating episodes of depression \\nand mania. Symptoms of mania last at least one week, cause clear social or academic problems, and \\ninclude extreme distractibility, lack of need for sleep, unusually rapid speech or motor activity, excessive \\ntalking, and involvement in risky activities such as gambling or irresponsible sexual behavior. \\nThe key characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder  is excessive, uncontrolled worry (for example, \\npersistent worry about tests or speaking in class) occurring on most days for a period of six months. \\nSymptoms may include restlessness or feeling keyed up, irritability, being easily fatigued, muscle tension, \\ndifficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances.\\nTeens with substance use disorder  show a problematic pattern of drug or alcohol use over 12 months \\nor more, leading to significant impairment or distress. Symptoms include taking larger amounts, over \\na longer period, than intended; continued use despite knowing that it is causing problems; increased \\nirritability and anger; sleep disturbances; and family conflict over substance use.\\nConduct disorder  is a repetitive, persistent pattern in children or adolescents of violating the rights of \\nothers, rules, or social norms, occurring over 12 months. Symptoms include bullying or threatening \\nothers, physical fights, fire-setting, destroying property, breaking into houses/cars, physical cruelty to \\npeople or animals, lying, shoplifting, running away from home, and frequent truancy.\\nAnorexia nervosa and bulimia are eating disorders  that are strongly linked to other mental disorders, \\nespecially depression and anxiety. Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include refusal to maintain body AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 1\\nweight at a minimally normal level for age and height, intense fear of gaining weight, and a denial of \\nlow body weight. Symptoms of bulimia include repeated episodes of binge eating (at least twice a week \\nfor three months) combined with recurrent inappropriate behaviors to avoid gaining weight such as \\nvomiting, misuse of laxatives, or excessive exercise. \\nHelp Is Available\\nIf there are concerns about a studentвЂ™s emotional or mental health, a referral should be made to an \\nappropriate mental health professional for assessment, diagnosis, and possible treatment. Mental \\nhealth resources that may be available include school counselors, community mental health agencies, \\nemergency psychiatric screening centers, and childrenвЂ™s mobile response programs. Pediatricians and \\nprimary care providers can also be a source of mental health referrals.\\nSome depressed teens show improvement in just four to six weeks with talk therapy alone. Most others \\nexperience a significant reduction of depressive symptoms with antidepressant medication. Medication is \\nusually essential in treating severe depression and other serious mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder \\nand schizophrenia. Since 2004, an FDA warning has recommended close monitoring of youth taking \\nantidepressants for worsening of symptoms, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and other changes. Risks \\nof medication must be weighed against the risks of not effectively treating depression or other serious \\nmental disorders.  \\n(Adapted with permission from More Than Sad: Preventing T een Suicide , American Foundation for \\nSuicide Prevention, http://www.morethansad.org .)\\nAdditional Information\\nCenter for School Mental Health Assistance .

The following are strategies that schools can use to help students \\nbalance the timing and intensity of their emotional expression and restore the schoolвЂ™s ability to \\nfunction effectively.\\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe term emotional regulation  refers to a personвЂ™s ability to appropriately experience and express \\nintense emotions such as grief and fear. Most adolescents have mastered basic skills that allow \\nthem to handle strong emotions encountered day to day. But these skills may be challenged \\nin the face of a suicide. In addition, young people may not yet have learned how to recognize \\ncomplex feelings or physical indicators of distress, such as stomach upset, restlessness, or \\ninsomnia. Moreover, adolescence marks a time of increased risk for difficulties with emotional \\nregulation, given the intensification of emotional responses that come with puberty and the \\nstructural changes in the brain that occur during this developmental period. \\nIt is therefore important for schools to provide students with appropriate opportunities to express \\ntheir emotions and identify strategies for managing them, so the school can continue its primary \\nfocus of education. It may also be useful for school staff to identify and reach out to families of \\nstudents who are not coming to school. \\nWhen implementing these strategies, leadership will most likely be provided by the school \\ncounselor, school nurse, and/or community mental health partner, all of whom should be \\nmembers of the schoolвЂ™s Crisis Response Team. However, all adults in the school community can \\nhelp by modeling calm, caring, and thoughtful behavior. \\nSchedule Meetings with Students in Small Groups\\nIt will likely be necessary to adjust the regular academic schedule in order to spend time with \\nstudents to help address their emotional needs. It is preferable to reach out to students in a \\ndeliberate and timely way rather than to allow the emotional environment to escalate. It is also \\npreferable to meet with students in small groups, which enables adults to identify those youth \\nwho appear in need of additional attention. \\nIf possible, have counselors go into the classrooms to give students accurate information about \\nsuicide, the kinds of reactions that can be expected after hearing about a peerвЂ™s suicide death, and \\nsafe coping strategies to help them in the coming days and weeks.\\nWherever possible, group meetings should follow a structured outline, keep to a time limit, \\nand provide each student with an opportunity to speak. The meetings should focus on helping \\nstudents identify and express their feelings and discuss practical coping strategies (including \\nappropriate ways to memorialize the loss) so they may return their focus to their regular routines \\nand activities.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 130\\nIf the deceased student participated in sports, clubs, or other school activities, the first practice, \\ngame, rehearsal, or meeting after the death may be difficult for the other students. These events \\ncan provide further opportunities for the adults in the school community to help the students \\nappropriately acknowledge the loss.\\nHelp Students Identify and Express Their Emotions  \\nYouth will vary widely in terms of emotional expression. Some may become openly emotional, \\nothers may be reluctant to talk at all, and still others may use humor. Acknowledge the breadth \\nof feelings and diversity of experiences and emphasize the importance of being respectful  \\nof others.\\nSome students may need help to identify emotions beyond simply sad, angry, or happy, and \\nmay need reassurance that a wide range of feelings and experiences are to be expected. They may \\nalso need to be reminded that emotions may be experienced as physical symptoms, including \\nbutterflies in the stomach, shortness of breath, insomnia, fatigue, or irritability. To facilitate this \\ndiscussion, students may be asked:\\n What is your biggest concern about the immediate future?\\n What would help you feel safer right now?\\nPractical Coping Strategies\\nEncourage students to think about specific things they can do when intense emotions such as \\nworry or sadness begin to well up, including:\\nвЂў simple relaxation and distraction skills, such as taking three deep slow breaths, counting to 10,  \\n or picturing themselves in a favorite calm and relaxing place\\nвЂў engaging in favorite activities or hobbies such as music, talking with a friend, reading, or going  \\n to a movie \\nвЂў exercising \\nвЂў thinking about how theyвЂ™ve coped with difficulties in the past and reminding themselves that  \\n they can use those same coping skills now\\nвЂў writing a list of people they can turn to for support \\nвЂў writing a list of things theyвЂ™re looking forward to\\nвЂў focusing on individual goals, such as returning to a shared class or spending time with \\n mutual friends\\nOften, youth will express guilt about having fun or thinking about other things. They may feel \\nthat they somehow need permission to engage in activities that will help them feel better and \\ntake their mind off the stressful situation.\\nStudents should also be encouraged to think about how they want to remember their friend. \\nIdeas range from writing a personal note to the family, to attending the memorial service, to \\ndoing something kind for another person in honor of their friend. Be sure to educate students \\nabout the schoolвЂ™s guidelines regarding memorialization . Acknowledging their need to express \\ntheir feelings while helping them identify appropriate ways to do so can begin the process of \\nreturning their focus to their daily lives and responsibilities.

They may also need reliable information relating to the \\ndocument Facts About Mental Disorders and Suicide in Adolescents . \\nAnniversary of the Death\\nThe anniversary of the death (and other significant dates, such as the deceasedвЂ™s birthday) may \\nstir up emotions and can be an upsetting time for some students and staff.

For example, a school may be able to offer relevant information (such as the likely \\nturnout at the funeral) and anticipate problems (such as the possibility that students may gather \\nlate at night at the place where the deceased died). A coordinated approach can be especially \\ncritical when the suicide death receives a great deal of media coverage and the entire community \\nbecomes involved.\\nCoroner/Medical Examiner\\nThe coroner or medical examiner is the best starting point for confirming that the death has \\nin fact been declared a suicide. (In some cases, it may also be necessary to contact the police \\ndepartment to verify the information). It is important that schools Get The Facts First  and \\nascertain that all information is accurate before communicating with students.\\nHowever, given how quickly news and rumors spread (including through media coverage, e-mail, \\ntexting, and social networking sites), schools may not be able to wait for a final determination \\nbefore they need to begin communicating with the students. In those cases, schools can say, вЂњAt \\nthis time, this is what we knowвЂ¦вЂќ \\nThere may also be cases in which there is disagreement between the authorities and the family \\nregarding the cause of death. For example, the death may have been declared a probable suicide \\nbut the family believes it to have been a homicide or an accident. Or the death may have been \\ndeclared a suicide, but the family does not want this communicated, perhaps due to stigma, for \\nfear of risking contagion, or because they simply do not (yet) believe or accept that it was suicide. \\nSchools have a responsibility to balance the need to be truthful with the school community while \\nremaining sensitive to the family. They can take this opportunity to educate the community \\n(including potentially vulnerable students) about the causes and complexity of suicide and to \\nidentify available mental health resources. For example, a school might say, вЂњAccording to the \\nmedical examiner, the death has been declared a suicide. It can sometimes be difficult for us to \\nbe absolutely sure whether a death was intentional or not (for example, in the case of a drug \\noverdose or a motor vehicle accident involving a single vehicle). While we may never know all \\nof the details, we are deeply saddened, and want to take this opportunity to teach you some \\nimportant information about suicide and where you can find help.вЂќвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 133\\nOf course, if a legal gag order is in effect, the school attorney should first research the applicable \\nstate law regarding discussing the cause of death before the school issues a statement.\\nPolice Department\\nThe police will likely be an important source of information about the death, particularly if there \\nis an ongoing investigation (for example, if it has not yet been determined whether the death \\nwas suicide or homicide). The school will need to be in close communication with the police to \\ndetermine (a) what they can and cannot say to the school community so as not to interfere with \\nthe investigation, and (b) whether there are certain students who must be interviewed by the \\npolice before the school can debrief or counsel them in any way.  \\nThere may also be situations in which the school has information thatвЂ™s relevant to the ability of \\nthe police to keep students safe. For example, the school may become aware that students have \\nestablished a memorial off-campus and may even be engaging in dangerous behavior (such as \\ngathering in large groups at the site of the death at night or holding vigils at which alcohol is \\nbeing consumed) and may need to enlist the cooperation of the police to keep the students safe. \\nThe school may also be in a unique position to brief the police (and even the family) about what \\nto expect at the funeral or memorial service in terms of turnout and other safety concerns. \\nMayorвЂ™s Office and Local Government\\nA student suicide death may reveal an underlying community-wide problem such as drug or \\nalcohol use, bullying, gang violence, or a possible community-wide suicide cluster.  Because \\nschools function withinвЂ”not separate fromвЂ”the surrounding community, local government \\nentities such as the mayorвЂ™s office can be helpful partners in promoting dialogue and presenting a \\nunited front in the interest of protecting the communityвЂ™s young people. \\nFuneral Director\\nThe school and funeral home are complementary sources of information for the community. \\nSchools are often in an excellent position to give the funeral director a heads-up about what \\nto expect at the funeral in terms of the number and types of students likely to attend, and the \\npossible need to have additional security present. The school can also provide information \\nabout local counseling and other resources to the funeral directors, with the request that the \\ninformation be made available to attendees at the funeral.\\nSchools can ask the funeral director to provide (or recommend) materials that the school could \\nprovide to students to help them prepare for the funeral. Schools can also encourage the funeral \\ndirector to talk to the family about the importance of scheduling the service outside of school \\nhours, encouraging studentsвЂ™ parents to attend, and providing counselors to meet with distraught \\nstudents after the service (and the need for a quiet area in which to do so).\\nClergy\\nBecause the school may be in the best position to understand the risk of contagion, it can play \\nan important role by encouraging a dialogue between the family and the clergy (or whomever \\nwill be officiating at the service) to help sensitize them to the issue. This dialogue may provide an \\nopportunity to explain the importance of not inadvertently romanticizing either the student or AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 134\\nthe death in the eulogy, but instead emphasizing the connection between suicide and underlying \\nmental health issues such as depression or anxiety, which can cause substantial psychological pain \\nbut may not be apparent to others (or may manifest as behavioral problems or substance abuse).\\nOf course, if the school has a religious affiliation, it will be important to include clergy who are \\non staff in any communications and outreach efforts to support the student body, and encourage \\nthem to be familiar with their faithвЂ™s current understanding of the relationship between mental \\nillness and suicide.\\nMental Health and Medical Communities\\nMost schools have counselors on staff, and it is important that these individuals are linked to \\nother mental health professionals in the community. In particular, it is advisable that the school \\nestablish an ongoing relationship with a community mental health center that can see students \\nin the event of a psychiatric emergency. In the aftermath of a suicide death, schools will want to \\nnotify the center to ensure seamless referrals if students show signs of distress. Schools will also \\nwant to publicize crisis hotline numbers such as Lifeline: 800-273-TALK (8255). \\nIn addition, schools can encourage the local medical community, including primary care doctors \\nand pediatricians, to screen for depression, substance abuse, and other relevant disorders in the \\nyouth they see.\\nOutside Trauma Responders \\nWorking with schools in the aftermath of a suicide death can easily exhaust school crisis team \\nmembers, which can interfere with their ability to effectively assist the students. Bringing in \\ntrained trauma responders from other school districts or local mental health or crisis centers to \\nwork alongside the schoolвЂ™s crisis team membersвЂ”and to provide care for the caregiversвЂ”can be \\nquite helpful. \\nCommunity Organizations\\nSchools may also wish to network with their local chapter of the American Foundation for \\nSuicide Prevention and with suicide bereavement support groups (see http://www  .afsp .org ).\\nAdditional Information\\nSPAN USA and Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) .

It can be challenging for schools to strike a \\nbalance between compassionately meeting the needs of distraught students while preserving the \\nability of the school to fulfill its primary purpose of education. In the case of suicide, schools \\nmust consider how to appropriately memorialize the student who died without risking suicide \\ncontagion among other students who may themselves be at risk. \\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nIt is very important that schools strive to treat all deaths in the same way. Having one approach \\nfor memorializing a student who died of cancer or in a car accident and a different approach for \\na student who died by suicide reinforces stigma and may be deeply and unfairly painful to the \\nstudentвЂ™s family and friends.\\nNevertheless, because adolescents are especially vulnerable to the risk of suicide contagion , \\nitвЂ™s equally important to memorialize the student in a way that doesnвЂ™t inadvertently glamorize \\nor romanticize either the student or the death. Schools can do this by seeking opportunities \\nto emphasize the connection between suicide and underlying mental health issues such as \\ndepression or anxiety that can cause substantial psychological pain but may not be apparent to \\nothers (or that may manifest as behavioral problems or substance abuse).\\nWherever possible, schools should both meet with the studentвЂ™s friends and coordinate with the \\nfamily, in the interest of identifying a meaningful, safe approach to acknowledging the loss. This \\nsection includes several creative suggestions for memorializing students who have died by suicide.\\nFunerals and Memorial Services\\nAll the recommendations made here focus on keeping the regular school schedule intact to the \\nmaximum extent possible for the benefit of the entire student body (including those who may \\nnot have known the deceased). \\nWhile at first glance schools may appear to provide an obvious setting for a funeral or memorial \\nservice because of their connection to the community and their ability to accommodate a large \\ncrowd, it is strongly advised that such services not be held on school grounds, to enable the \\nschool to focus instead on maintaining its regular schedule, structure, and routine. Additionally, \\nusing a room in the school for a funeral service can inextricably connect that space to the death, \\nmaking it difficult for students to return there for regular classes or activities. \\nIn situations where school personnel are able to collaborate with the family regarding the funeral \\nor memorial service arrangements, it is also strongly advised that the service be held outside  of \\nschool hours.  \\nIf the family does hold the service during school hours, it is recommended that school remain \\nopen and that school buses not be used to transport students to and from the service. Students \\nshould be permitted to leave school to attend the service only with appropriate parental permis-\\nsion (regular school protocols should be followed for dismissing students over the age of majority). вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 136\\nIf possible, the school should coordinate with the family and funeral director to arrange for \\ncounselors to attend the service. A guide for funeral directors is available at  \\nhttp://www.sprc.org/library/funeraldirectors.pdf . In all cases, the principal or another senior \\nadministrator should attend the funeral.\\nSchools should strongly encourage parents whose children express an interest in attending the \\nfuneral to attend with them. This provides not only emotional support but also an opportunity \\nfor parents to open a discussion with their children and remind them that help is available if they \\nor a friend are in need.\\nSpontaneous Memorials\\nIn the immediate aftermath of a suicide death, it is not unusual for students to create a \\nspontaneous memorial by leaving flowers, cards, poems, pictures, stuffed animals, or other items \\nin a place closely associated with the student, such as his or her locker or classroom seat, or at \\nthe site where the student died. Students may even come to school wearing t-shirts or buttons \\nbearing photographs of the deceased student.\\nThe schoolвЂ™s goal should be to balance the studentsвЂ™ need to grieve with the goal of limiting the \\nrisk of inadvertently glamorizing the death. In all cases, schools should have a consistent policy \\nso that suicide deaths are handled in the same manner as any other deaths. A combination \\nof time limits and straightforward communication can help to restore equilibrium and avoid \\nglamorizing the death in ways that may increase the risk of contagion. Although it may in \\nsome cases be necessary to set limits for students, it is important to do so with compassion and \\nsensitivity, offering creative suggestions  whenever possible. For example, schools may wish \\nto make posterboard and markers available so that students can gather and write messages. It \\nis advisable to set up the posters in an area that may be avoided by those who donвЂ™t wish to \\nparticipate (i.e., not in the cafeteria or at the front entrance). After a few days, the posters can be \\nremoved and offered to the family.\\nWhen a memorial is spontaneously created on school grounds, schools are advised to monitor it \\nfor messages that may be inappropriate (hostile or inflammatory) or that indicate students who \\nmay themselves be at risk. Schools can leave such memorials in place until after the funeral (or \\nfor up to approximately five days), after which the tribute objects may be offered to the family. \\nIt is generally not necessary to prohibit access to the site or to cordon it off, which would merely \\ndraw excessive attention to it. \\nIt is recommended that schools discourage requests to create and distribute t-shirts and buttons \\nbearing images of the deceased by explaining that, while these items may be comforting to some \\nstudents, they may be quite upsetting to others. If students come to school wearing such items \\nwithout first seeking permission, it is recommended that they be allowed to wear the items for \\nthat day only, and that it should be explained to them that repeatedly bringing images of the \\ndeceased student into the school can be disruptive and can glamorize suicide.\\nSince the emptiness of the deceased studentвЂ™s chair can be unsettling and evocative, after \\napproximately five days (or after the funeral), seat assignments may be re-arranged to create a \\nnew environment. Teachers should explain in advance that the intention is to strike a balance \\nbetween compassionately honoring the student who has died while at the same time returning AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 137\\nthe focus back to the classroom curriculum. The students can be involved in planning how to \\nrespectfully remove the desk; for example, they could read a statement that emphasizes their love \\nfor their friend and their commitment to work to eradicate suicide in his or her memory.\\nWhen a spontaneous memorial occurs off school grounds, the schoolвЂ™s ability to exert influence is \\nlimited. It can, nevertheless, encourage a responsible approach among the students by explaining \\nthat it is recommended that memorials be time-limited (again, approximately five days, or until \\nafter the funeral), at which point the memorial would be disassembled and the items offered \\nto the family. Another approach is to suggest that the students participate in a (supervised) \\nceremony to disassemble the memorial, during which music could be played and students could \\nbe permitted to take part of it home; the rest of the items would then be offered to the family.\\nStudents may also hold spontaneous gatherings or candlelight vigils. Schools should discourage \\ngatherings that are large and unsupervised; when necessary, administrators may consider enlisting \\nthe cooperation of local police  to monitor off-campus sites for safety. Counselors can also be \\nenlisted to attend these gatherings to offer support, guidance, and supervision.\\nIt is not recommended that flags be flown at half-staff (a decision generally made by local \\ngovernment authorities rather than the school administration in any event).\\nSchool Newspapers\\nCoverage of the studentвЂ™s death in the school newspaper may be seen as a kind of memorial; also, \\narticles can be used to educate students about suicide warning signs and available resources. It is \\nstrongly recommended that any such coverage be reviewed by an adult to ensure that it conforms \\nto the standards set forth in Reporting on Suicide: Recommendations for the Media , which \\nwas created by the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations.\\nEvents\\nThe studentвЂ™s classmates may wish to dedicate an event (such as a dance performance, poetry \\nreading, or sporting event) to the memory of their friend. End-of-the-year activities may raise \\nquestions of whether to award a posthumous degree or prize, or include a video tribute to the \\ndeceased student during graduation. The guiding principle is that all deaths should be treated \\nthe same way. Schools may also wish to encourage the studentвЂ™s friends to consider creative \\nsuggestions , such as organizing a suicide prevention-awareness or fundraising event.\\nOften, the parents of the deceased student express an interest in holding an assembly or other \\nevent to address the student body and describe the intense pain the suicide death has caused \\nto their family in the hopes that this will dissuade other students from taking their own lives. \\nWhile it is surely understandable that bereaved parents would wish to prevent another suicide \\ndeath, schools are strongly advised to explain that this is not an effective approach to suicide \\nprevention and may in fact even be risky, because students who are suffering from depression or \\nother mental health issues may hear the messaging very differently from the way it is intended, \\nand may even become more likely to act on their suicidal thoughts. Instead, parents should \\nbe encouraged to work with the school to bring an appropriate educational program to the \\nschool, such as More Than Sad: T een Depression , a DVD that educates teens about the signs and AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 138\\nsymptoms of depression (available at http://www.morethansad.org ) or others that are listed \\nin the Suicide Prevention Resource Center/American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Best \\nPractices Registry (available at http://www.sprc.org ).\\nYearbooks\\nAgain, the guiding principle is that all deaths should be treated the same way. So if there is a \\nhistory of dedicating the yearbook (or a page of the yearbook) to students who have died, that \\npolicy is equally applicable to a student who has died by suicide, provided that final editorial \\ndecisions are made by an adult. \\nWhenever possible, the focus should be on mental health and/or suicide prevention. For \\nexample, underneath the studentвЂ™s picture it might say, вЂњIn your memory we will work to erase \\nthe stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide.вЂќ The page might also include pictures of \\nclassmates engaging in a suicide prevention event such as an Out of the Darkness community \\nwalk ( http://www.outofthedarkness.org ).\\nGraduation \\nIf there is a tradition of including a tribute to deceased students who would have graduated with \\nthe class, students who have died by suicide should likewise be included. For example, schools \\nmay wish to include a brief statement acknowledging and naming those students from the \\ngraduating class who have died. Final decisions about what to include in such tributes should be \\nmade by an adult.\\nPermanent Memorials and Scholarships \\nSome communities wish to establish a permanent memorial (sometimes physical, such \\nas planting a tree or installing a bench or plaque; sometimes commemorative, such as a \\nscholarship). Others are afraid to do so.\\nWhile there is no research to suggest that permanent memorials per se create a risk of contagion, \\nthey can prove to be upsetting reminders to bereaved students, and therefore disruptive to \\nthe schoolвЂ™s goal of maintaining emotional regulation. Whenever possible, therefore, it is \\nrecommended that they be established off school grounds. Moreover, the school should bear in \\nmind that once it plants a tree, puts up a plaque, installs a park bench, or establishes a named \\nscholarship for one deceased student, it should be prepared to do so for others, which can \\nbecome quite difficult to sustain over time.\\nCreative Suggestions\\nSome schools may resist allowing any kind of memorialization at all, clamping down on any \\nstudent desire to publicly acknowledge the death for fear of glamorizing suicide and risking \\nsuicide contagion . But simply prohibiting any and all memorialization is problematic in its \\nown rightвЂ”it is deeply stigmatizing to the studentвЂ™s family and friends, and can generate intense \\nnegative reactions, which can exacerbate an already difficult situation and undermine the schoolвЂ™s \\nefforts to protect the student bodyвЂ™s emotional regulation. \\nSchools can play an important role in channeling the energy and passion of the students (and \\ngreater community) in a positive direction, balancing the communityвЂ™s need to grieve with the AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 139\\nimpact that the proposed activity will likely have on students, particularly those who were closest \\nto the student who died.  \\nIt can be helpful for schools to proactively suggest a meeting with the studentвЂ™s close friends \\nto talk about the type and timing of any memorialization. This can provide an important \\nopportunity for the students to be heard and for the school to sensitively explain its rationale \\nfor permitting certain kinds of activities and not others. Schools may even wish to establish a \\nstanding committee composed of students, school administrators, and family members that can \\nbe convened on an as-needed basis.\\nIt can also be helpful for schools to come equipped with specific, constructive suggestions for safe \\nmemorialization, such as:\\nвЂў holding a day of community service or creating a school-based community service program in \\nhonor of the deceased\\nвЂў putting together a team to participate in an awareness or fundraising event sponsored by \\none of the national mental health or suicide prevention organizations (e.g., http://www.\\noutofthedarkness.org ), or holding a local fundraising event to support a local crisis hotline or \\nother suicide prevention program\\nвЂў sponsoring a mental health awareness day\\nвЂў purchasing books on mental health for the school or local library\\nвЂў working with the administration to develop and implement a curriculum focused on effective \\nproblem-solving\\nвЂў volunteering at a community crisis hotline\\nвЂў raising funds to help the family defray their funeral expenses\\nвЂў making a book available in the school office for several weeks in which students can write \\nmessages to the family, share memories of the deceased, or offer condolences; the book can \\nthen be presented to the family on behalf of the school community \\nAdditional Information\\nCentre for Suicide Prevention (Calgary) .

In the emotionally charged \\natmosphere that can follow a suicide death, schools may be inclined to try to control or stifle \\nsuch communications by studentsвЂ”a task that is virtually impossible in any event, since they \\ngenerally take place outside of school hours and property. Schools can, however, utilize social \\nmedia effectively to disseminate information and promote suicide prevention efforts.\\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nFollowing a suicide death, students may immediately turn to social media for a variety of \\npurposes, including transmitting news about the death (both accurate and rumored), calling \\nfor impromptu gatherings (both safe and unsafe), creating online memorials (both moving and \\nrisky), and posting messages (both appropriate and hostile) about the deceased.\\nAlthough schools may initially consider social media to be outside of its traditional jurisdiction, \\nthey can in fact collaborate with students and utilize these tools to disseminate important \\nand accurate information to the school community, identify students who may be in need of \\nadditional support or further intervention, share resources for grief support and mental health \\ncare, and promote safe messages that emphasize suicide prevention and minimize the risk of \\nsuicide contagion.\\nInvolve Students \\nIt can be very beneficial for a designated member of the Crisis Response Team (ideally someone \\nfrom the schoolвЂ™s information technology department) to reach out to friends of the deceased \\nand other key students to work collaboratively in this area. Working in partnership with student \\nleaders will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of social media efforts, since the students \\nthemselves are in the best position to help identify the particular media favored by the student \\nbody, engage their peers in honoring their friendвЂ™s life appropriately and safely, and inform \\nschool staff about online communications that may be worrisome.\\nStudents who are recruited to help should be reassured that school staff are only interested \\nin supporting a healthy response to their peerвЂ™s death, not in thwarting communication. \\nThey should also be made aware that staff are available and prepared to intervene if any \\ncommunications reveal cause for concern.\\nDisseminate Information\\nSchools may already have a website and/or an online presence (or page) on one or more social \\nmedia sites; students can help identify others that are currently popular. These can be used to \\nproactively communicate with students, teachers, and parents about:\\nвЂў the funeral or memorial service (schools should of course check with the studentвЂ™s family before \\nsharing information about the funeral) \\nвЂў where students can go for help or meet with counselorsвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 141\\nвЂў mental illness and the causes of suicide\\nвЂў local mental health resources\\nвЂў the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number: 800-273-TALK (8255)\\nвЂў national suicide prevention organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  \\n(http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org ), the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention  \\n(http://www.afsp.org ), and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center ( http://www.sprc.org ).\\nSchools should emphasize help-seeking and suicide prevention. More specific guidance for \\nsafe message content may be found at http://www.sprc.org/library/SafeMessagingfinal.pdf . \\nStudents can also be enlisted to post this information on their own online pages. \\nOnline Memorial Pages\\nOnline memorial pages and message boards have become common practice in the aftermath of  \\na death.\\nSome schools (with the permission and support of the deceased studentвЂ™s family) may choose \\nto establish a memorial page on the school website or on a social networking site. As with all \\nmemorialization  following a suicide death, such pages should take care not to glamorize the \\ndeath in ways that may lead other at-risk students to identify with the person who died. It is \\ntherefore vital that memorial pages utilize safe messaging, include resources, be monitored by an \\nadult, and be time-limited.\\nIt is recommended that online memorial pages remain active for up to 30 to 60 days after the \\ndeath, at which time they should be taken down and replaced with a statement acknowledging \\nthe caring and supportive messages that had been posted and encouraging students who wish to \\nfurther honor their friend to consider other creative suggestions .\\nIf the studentвЂ™s friends create a memorial page of their own, it is important that school personnel \\ncommunicate with the students to ensure that the page includes safe messaging and accurate \\ninformation. School personnel should also join any student-initiated memorial pages so that they \\ncan monitor and respond as appropriate.\\nMonitor and Respond \\nTo the extent possible, social media sites (including the deceasedвЂ™s wall or personal profile pages) \\nshould be monitored for:\\nвЂў rumors\\nвЂў information about upcoming or impromptu gatherings\\nвЂў derogatory messages about the deceased\\nвЂў messages that bully or victimize current students \\nвЂў comments indicating students who may themselves be at risk\\nResponses may include posting comments that dispel rumors, reinforce the connection \\nbetween mental illness and suicide, and offer resources for mental health care. In some cases, \\nthe appropriate response may go beyond simply posting a comment, safe message, or resource \\ninformation. It may extend to notifying parents and local law enforcement about the need for \\nsecurity at a late-night student gathering, for example.AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 142\\nIn some cases it may be necessary to take action against so-called trolls who may seek out \\nmemorial pages on social media sites and post deliberately offensive messages and pictures. Most \\nsites have a report mechanism or comparable feature, which enables users to notify the site of the \\noffensive material and request that it be removed. The administrator of the memorial page may \\nalso be able to block particular individuals from accessing the site. Because the available options \\nvary from site to site and can evolve over time, schools are advised to contact the particular site \\nfor instructions.\\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has developed an in-depth online postvention manual \\nthat details how to find various social media sites and other online groups, post resources, and \\nreach out to parents. It also includes case examples and resource links and is available at  \\nhttp://www.sprc.org/library/LifelineOnlinePostventionManual.pdf .\\nOn occasion, schools may become aware of posted messages indicating that another student may \\nbe at risk of suicide. Messages of greatest concern may suggest hopelessness or refer to plans to \\njoin the deceased student. In those instances, it may be necessary to alert the studentвЂ™s family \\nand/or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to request that a crisis center follow up \\nwith the student.\\nAdditional Information\\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

In fact, \\nsuicide(s) can even follow the death of a student from other causes, such as an accident. \\nAlthough contagion is comparatively rare (accounting for between 1 percent and 5 percent of \\nall suicide deaths annually), adolescents and teenagers appear to be more susceptible to imitative \\nsuicide than adults, largely because they may identify more readily with the behavior and \\nqualities of their peers. \\nIf there appears to be contagion, schools should consider taking additional steps beyond the \\nbasic crisis response  outlined in this toolkit, including identifying other students who may be at \\nheightened risk of suicide and actively collaborating with community partners in a coordinated \\nsuicide prevention effort.\\nIdentifying Other Students at Possible Risk for Suicide\\nIn the face of apparent contagion, it is important for schools to utilize counselors and others \\nwho have been trained to identify students who may be at heightened risk for suicide due \\nto underlying mental disorders or behavioral problems (such as depression, anxiety, conduct \\ndisorder, and/or substance abuse) and who have been exposed to the prior suicide either directly \\n(by virtue of close identification or relationship with the deceased) or indirectly (by virtue of \\nextensive media coverage).\\nOf special concern are those students who:\\nвЂў have a history of suicide attempts\\nвЂў are dealing with stressful life events such as a death or divorce in the family \\nвЂў were eyewitnesses to the death\\nвЂў are family members or close friends of the deceased (including siblings at other schools as well   \\n as teammates, classmates, and acquaintances of the deceased)\\nвЂў received a phone call, text, or other communication from the deceased foretelling the suicide\\nвЂў may have fought with or bullied the deceased\\nSchools can also seek to identify those in the general student body who may be at heightened \\nrisk by using a mental health screening tool (a process sometimes called case finding) such as \\nTeenScreen Schools and Communities of the National Center for Mental Health Checkups \\n(http://www.teenscreen.org ), Signs of Suicide ( http://www.mentalhealthscreening.org ), \\nor others listed in the Suicide Prevention Resource Center/American Foundation for Suicide \\nPrevention Best Practices Registry ( http://www.sprc.org ).вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 144\\nConnecting with Local Mental Health Resources\\nSchools should work with local primary care and mental health resources (including \\npediatricians, community mental health centers, and local private practice mental health \\nclinicians) to develop plans to refer at-risk youth. Once plans are established, they should be \\nreviewed with school counselors and other personnel so that any student who is identified as \\nbeing at high risk can be referred to a local mental health screening center or private practitioner \\nfor further evaluation.\\nManaging Heightened Emotional Reactions at School \\nThe possibility of a suicide cluster can be exceedingly upsetting. At a minimum, school \\ncounselors and/or trained outside professionals should be available to meet with distraught \\nstudents for grief counseling and to help them make linkages with other resources in the \\ncommunity.\\nSchools, in partnership with community mental health resources, might also consider creating \\ndrop-in centers that provide a safe place for youth to be together after school hours. These \\ncan be staffed by volunteer counselors and clinicians from the community who can provide \\ngrief counseling as well as identify and refer youth who may need additional mental health or \\nsubstance abuse services. These centers can also be used during times of particularly heightened \\nemotion such as graduation or the anniversary of the death(s). \\nMonitoring Media Coverage\\nParticularly when there have been multiple suicides, media interest in the deaths will be intense. \\nThe school should delegate one spokesman for public statements, disseminate the document \\nReporting on Suicide: Recommendations for the Media , and follow the safe messaging \\nguidelines at http://www.sprc.org/library/SafeMessagingfinal.pdf . The risk of contagion is \\nrelated to the amount, duration, and prominenceвЂ”as well as the contentвЂ”of media coverage, so \\nit is extremely important that schools strongly encourage the media to adhere to the parameters \\nset forth by the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations. These recommendations include:\\nвЂў not glamorizing or romanticizing the victim or suicide itself\\nвЂў not oversimplifying the causes of suicide\\nвЂў not detailing the method \\nвЂў not including photographs of the death scene or of devastated mourners, which can be    \\n attractive for vulnerable youth who may be desperate for attention and recognition\\nвЂў including hotline numbers (such as Lifeline: 800-273-8255) and information about local   \\n mental health resources in each article\\nBuilding a Community Coalition\\nSchools cannot possibly manage all aspects of reacting to possible contagion and preventing its spread \\nwithout collaborating with community partners . It is strongly recommended that the community \\nconvene a coordinating committee that can meet on a regular basis and serve as a decision-\\nmaking body and identify a leader for these efforts. The committee should include senior AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 145\\nrepresentation from the school, together with representatives from as many of the following  \\nas possible:  \\nвЂў law enforcement\\nвЂў government, such as the mayorвЂ™s office, medical examinerвЂ™s office, and public health department\\nвЂў parents who have demonstrated community leadership in addressing drug and alcohol abuse,   \\nbullying, or other related issues\\nвЂў mental health community, such as community mental health centers, psychiatric screening   \\ncenters, private practitioners, and substance abuse treatment centers\\nвЂў social service agencies\\nвЂў clergy\\nвЂў funeral directors\\nвЂў first responders and hospital emergency room personnel\\nвЂў media (as coalition members, not to cover it as a news event)\\nвЂў students\\nвЂў suicide bereavement support group facilitators\\nвЂў primary health care providers/clinics\\nThe committeeвЂ™s initial goals should include:\\nвЂў Identifying a leader or lead agency\\nвЂў Identifying any particular risk factors within the community, such as widespread drug and   \\n alcohol use, bullying, or easy access to means of suicide\\nвЂў Mobilizing existing mental health and primary care resources to identify and help young   \\n people who may be at high risk\\nвЂў Mobilizing law enforcement to patrol locations where youth may gather to memorialize the   \\n deceased and/or engage in risky behaviors such as drinking or drug use\\nвЂў Mobilizing parents to assist in monitoring youth who come to their homes and neighborhoods\\nвЂў Reaching out to other groups and businesses in the community where youths gather, such as   \\n recreation centers, religious organizations, sports leagues, movie theaters, and diners\\nThe committee should also consider the gaps in existing resources and identify additional \\nresources that may be needed, such as:  \\nвЂў Creating a position for a suicide prevention resource coordinator \\nвЂў Hiring or contracting for additional counseling staff in affected schools \\nвЂў Hiring staff to provide screening programs in affected schools, such as Columbia Teen Screen\\nвЂў Developing alcohol and drug programs for youth\\nвЂў Developing teen centers where youth can come together and engage in social and recreational   \\n activities with caring adults\\nвЂў Creating a public awareness campaign or website to educate the community about mental   \\n disorders, substance abuse, and other at-risk behaviors, and to decrease stigma and increase   \\n help-seeking.

Faced with students struggling to cope and \\na community struggling to respond, schools need reliable information, practical tools, and \\npragmatic guidance.\\nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and the Suicide Prevention Resource \\nCenter (SPRC), two of the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations, have collaborated \\nto produce this toolkit to assist schools in the aftermath of a suicide (or other death) in the \\nschool community. Both organizations have often been contacted by schools in the aftermath \\nof a suicide death. Because neither AFSP nor SPRC have the capacity to provide customized \\ntechnical assistance in these circumstances, this toolkit was created to help schools determine \\nwhat to do, when, and how. It is a highly practical resource for schools facing real-time crises. \\nWhile designed specifically to address the aftermath of suicide, schools will find it useful \\nfollowing other deaths as well.\\nThe toolkit reflects consensus recommendations developed in consultation with a diverse group \\nof national experts, including school-based personnel, clinicians, researchers, and crisis response \\nprofessionals. It incorporates relevant existing material and research findings as well as references, \\ntemplates, and links to additional information and assistance. It is not, however, intended to be a \\ncomprehensive curriculum. For more resources, see Additional Information . \\nAfter a Suicide: A T oolkit for Schools  includes an overview of key considerations, general guidelines \\nfor action, doвЂ™s and donвЂ™ts, templates, and sample materials, all in an easily accessible format \\napplicable to diverse populations and communities. Principles that have guided the development \\nof the toolkit include the following: \\nвЂў Schools should strive to treat all student deaths in the same way. Having one approach for a \\n student who dies of cancer (for example) and another for a student who dies by suicide   \\n reinforces the unfortunate stigma that still surrounds suicide and may be deeply and unfairly   \\n painful to the deceased studentвЂ™s family and close friends.\\nвЂў At the same time, schools should be aware that adolescents are vulnerable to the risk of suicide \\n contagion. It is important not to inadvertently simplify, glamorize, or romanticize the student   \\n or his/her death.\\nвЂў Schools should emphasize that the student who died by suicide was likely struggling with a\\n mental disorder, such as depression or anxiety, that can cause substantial psychological pain   \\n but may not have been apparent to others (or that may have shown as behavior problems or   \\n substance abuse).\\nвЂў Help is available for any student who may be struggling with mental health issues or \\n suicidal feelings.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 17\\nSpecific areas addressed in the toolkit are listed below:  \\nCrisis Response\\nA suicide death in a school community requires implementing a coordinated crisis response to \\nassist staff, students, and families who are impacted by the death and to restore an environment \\nfocused on education. Whether or not there is a Crisis Response Plan already in place, the toolkit \\ncontains information that can be used to initiate a coordinated response once the basic facts \\nabout the death have been obtained. Included are a Team LeaderвЂ™s Checklist (who does what), \\ntalking points for use with students, staff, parents, and the media; sample handouts; meeting \\nguidelines; and links to additional resources. \\nHelping Students Cope \\nMost adolescents have mastered basic skills that allow them to handle strong emotions \\nencountered day to day, but these skills may be challenged in the face of a school suicide. \\nMoreover, adolescence marks a time of increased risk for difficulties with emotional regulation, \\ngiven the intensification of responses that come with puberty and the structural changes in \\nthe brain that occur during this developmental period. Schools should provide students with \\nappropriate opportunities to express their emotions and identify strategies for managing them, so \\nthat the school can return to its primary focus of education.\\nWorking with the Community\\nBecause schools exist within the context of a larger community, it is important that in the \\naftermath of a suicide (or other death) the school administrative team establish and maintain open \\nlines of communication with community partners such as the coroner/medical examiner, police \\ndepartment, mayorвЂ™s office, funeral director, clergy, and mental health professionals. Even in those \\nrealms where the school may have limited authority (such as the funeral), a collaborative approach \\nallows for the sharing of important information and coordination of strategies. A coordinated \\napproach can be especially critical when the suicide receives a great deal of media coverage and \\nwhen the community is looking to the school for guidance, support, answers, and leadership. \\nMemorialization \\nSchool communities often wish to memorialize a student who has died, reflecting a basic human \\ndesire to remember those we have lost. It can be challenging for schools to strike a comfortable \\nbalance between compassionately meeting the needs of distraught students while preserving the \\nability of the school to fulfill its primary purpose of education. In the case of suicide, schools \\nmust also consider how to appropriately memorialize the student who has died without risking \\nsuicide contagion among those surviving students who may themselves be at risk. It is very \\nimportant that schools strive to treat all deaths in the same way.\\nSocial Media\\nSocial media such as texting, Facebook, and T witter are rapidly becoming the primary means of \\ncommunication for people of all ages, especially youth. While these communications generally take \\nplace outside of school (and may therefore fall outside of the schoolвЂ™s control or jurisdiction), they \\ncan nevertheless be utilized as part of the schoolвЂ™s response after a studentвЂ™s suicide. By working in AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 18\\nвћћpartnership with key students to identify and monitor the relevant social networking sites, schools can \\nstrategically use social media to share prevention-oriented safe messaging, offer support to students \\nwho may be struggling to cope, and identify and respond to students who could be at risk themselves.\\nSuicide Contagion\\nContagion is the process by which one suicide may contribute to another. In fact, in some \\ncases suicide(s) can even follow the death of a student from other causes, such as an accident. \\nAlthough contagion is comparatively rare (accounting for between 1 percent and 5 percent \\nof all suicide deaths annually), adolescents appear to be more susceptible to imitative suicide \\nthan adults, largely because they may identify more readily with the behavior and qualities \\nof their peers. If there appears to be contagion, school administrators should consider taking \\nadditional steps beyond the basic crisis response, including stepping up efforts to identify other \\nstudents who may be at heightened risk of suicide, collaborating with community partners in a \\ncoordinated suicide prevention effort, and possibly bringing in outside experts.\\nBringing in Outside Help\\nSchool crisis team members should remain mindful of their own limitations and consider \\nbringing in trained trauma responders from other school districts or local mental health centers \\nto help them as needed.  \\nGoing Forward\\nIn the ensuing months, schools may wish to consider implementing suicide awareness programs \\nto educate teachers, other school personnel, and students themselves about the causes of suicidal \\nbehavior in young people and to identify those who may be at risk.\\nAdditional Information*\\nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and others .

If the cause of death has not been confirmed to \\nbe suicide, if there is an ongoing investigation, or if the family does not want the cause of death \\ndisclosed, it can be challenging for a school to determine how to proceed.\\nConfirm the Cause of Death\\nThe schoolвЂ™s principal or superintendent should first check with the coroner and/or the medical \\nexaminerвЂ™s office (or, if necessary, local law enforcement) to ascertain the official cause of death. \\nIf the death has been ruled a suicide, the school can proceed to communicate as described in the \\ncrisis response  section.\\nIf the Cause of Death Is Unconfirmed\\nIf the body has not yet been recovered or if there is an ongoing investigation, schools should \\nstate that the cause of death is still being determined and that additional information will be \\nforthcoming once it has been confirmed. Acknowledge that there are rumors (which are often \\ninaccurate), and remind students that rumors can be deeply hurtful and unfair to the missing/\\ndeceased person, their family, and their friends.\\nIf there is an ongoing investigation, schools should check with local law enforcement before \\nspeaking about the death with students who may need to be interviewed by the authorities.\\nIf the Family Does Not Want the Cause of Death Disclosed\\nWhile the fact that a student has died may be disclosed immediately, information about the \\ncause of death should not be disclosed to students until the family has been consulted. If the \\ndeath has been declared a suicide but the family does not want it disclosed, someone from \\nthe administration or counseling staff who has a good relationship with the family should be \\ndesignated to contact them to explain that students are already talking about the death amongst \\nthemselves, and that having adults in the school community talk to students about suicide and \\nits causes can help keep students safe.\\nIf the family refuses to permit disclosure, schools can state, вЂњThe family has requested that \\ninformation about the cause of death not be shared at this timeвЂќ  and can nevertheless use the \\nopportunity to talk with students about the phenomenon of suicide: вЂњWe know there has been \\na lot of talk about whether this was a suicide death.  Since the subject of suicide has been raised, \\nwe want to take this opportunity to give you accurate information about suicide in general, ways to \\nprevent it, and how to get help if you or someone you know is feeling depressed or may be suicidal.вЂќвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 110\\nCrisis Response\\nOnce a suicide death has been confirmed, the school should immediately implement a \\ncoordinated crisis response in order to effectively manage the situation, provide opportunities for \\ngrief support, maintain an environment focused on normal educational activities, help students \\ncope with their feelings, and minimize the risk of suicide contagion . What follows can be used \\nby any school, regardless of whether there is a pre-existing Crisis Response Plan in place. \\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe Crisis Response Team Leader (usually the school psychologist or counselor) has overall \\nresponsibility for the duration of the crisis. She or he should immediately assemble a Crisis \\nResponse Team, which will be responsible for implementing the various elements of the  \\ncrisis response.\\nThe Crisis Response T eam should be composed of at least five or six (but no more than 15) people \\nchosen for their skills, credentials, and ability to work compassionately and effectively under \\npressureвЂ”ideally a combination of administrators, counselors, social workers, psychologists, \\nnurses, and/or school resource officers. It can also be useful to include a member of the schoolвЂ™s \\ninformation technology or computer lab staff.\\nThe Crisis Response Team Leader should designate one individual as the Team Coordinator.\\nCrisis Response Team LeaderвЂ™s Checklist\\nвЂў Inform the school superintendent of the death.\\nвЂў Contact the deceasedвЂ™s family to offer condolences, inquire what the school can do to assist,   \\n discuss what students should be told, and inquire about funeral arrangements.\\nвЂў Call an immediate meeting of the Crisis Response Team to assign responsibilities.\\nвЂў Establish a plan to immediately notify faculty and staff of the death via the schoolвЂ™s crisis alert   \\n system (usually phone or e-mail).\\nвЂў Schedule an initial all-staff meeting  as soon as possible (ideally before school starts in the   \\n morning).\\nвЂў Arrange for students to be notified of the death in small groups such as homerooms \\n or advisories (not by overhead announcement or in a large assembly) and disseminate a  \\n death notification statement for students  to homeroom teachers, advisors, or others    \\n leading those groups. \\nвЂў Draft and disseminate a death notification statement for parents .\\nвЂў Disseminate handouts on Facts About Suicide and Mental Disorders in Adolescents  \\n and Talking About Suicide  to faculty.\\nвЂў Speak with school superintendent and Crisis Response Team Coordinator throughout \\n the day. \\nвЂў Determine whether additional grief counselors, crisis responders, or other resources may be   \\n needed from outside the school.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 111\\nTeam CoordinatorвЂ™s Checklist\\nThe tasks below may be delegated as appropriate to specific staff or faculty in the school.  \\nвЂў Conduct initial all-staff meeting .\\nвЂў Conduct periodic meetings for the Crisis Response Team members.\\nвЂў Monitor activities throughout school, making sure teachers, staff, and Crisis Response Team  \\n members have adequate support and resources.\\nвЂў Plan parent meeting  if necessary.  \\nвЂў Assign roles and responsibilities to Crisis Response Team members in the areas of Safety,  \\n Operations, Community Liaisons, Funeral, Media Relations, and Social Media.\\nSafety\\nвЂў Keep to regular school hours.\\nвЂў Ensure that students follow established dismissal procedures.\\nвЂў Call on school resource officers or plant manager to assist parents and others who may show  \\n up at the school and to keep media off of school grounds.\\nвЂў Pay attention to students who are having particular difficulty, including those who may be  \\n congregating in hallways and bathrooms, and encourage them to talk with counselors or  \\n other appropriate school personnel.\\nOperations\\nвЂў Assign a staff or faculty member to follow the deceased studentвЂ™s schedule to monitor peer  \\n reactions and answer questions.\\nвЂў If possible, arrange for several substitute teachers or вЂњfloatersвЂќ from other schools within \\n the district to be on hand in the building in case teachers need to take time out of  \\n their classrooms.\\nвЂў Arrange for crisis counseling rooms for staff and students.\\nвЂў Provide tissues and water throughout the building and arrange for food for faculty and \\n crisis counselors.\\nвЂў Work with administration, faculty, and counselors to identify individuals who may be having  \\n particular difficulty, such as family members, close friends, and teammates; those who had  \\n difficulties with the deceased; those who may have witnessed the death; and students known  \\n to have depression or prior suicidality; and work with school counseling staff to develop plans  \\n to provide psychological first aid to them.\\nвЂў Prepare to track and respond to student and/or family requests for memorialization .\\nCommunity Liaisons\\nвЂў Several Team members will be needed, each serving as the primary contact \\n for working with community  partners of various types, including:\\n вќЌ coroner/medical examiner , to ensure accuracy of information disseminated to \\n  school community\\n вќЌ police , as necessary, to ensure student safetyAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 112\\n вќЌ mayorвЂ™s office and local government , to facilitate community-wide response to the \\n  suicide death\\n вќЌ mental health and medical communities , as well as grief support organizations, to plan for  \\n  service needs\\n вќЌ arranging for outside trauma responders  and briefing them as they arrive on scene\\nFuneral\\nвЂў Communicate with the funeral director  about logistics, including the need for crisis   \\n counselors and/or security to be present at the funeral.

The key \\nsuicide risk factor is an undiagnosed, untreated, or ineffectively treated mental disorder. Research shows \\nthat over 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental disorder at the time of their death.\\nIn teens, the mental disorders most closely linked to suicide risk are major depressive disorder, bipolar \\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance use disorder, and eating disorders. \\nWhile in some cases these disorders may be precipitated by environmental stressors, they can also occur \\nas a result of changes in brain chemistry, even in the absence of an identifiable or obvious вЂњreason.вЂќ\\nSuicide is almost always complicated. In addition to the underlying disorders listed above, suicide \\nrisk can be affected by personality factors such as impulsivity, aggression, and hopelessness. Moreover, \\nsuicide risk can also be exacerbated by stressful life circumstances such as a history of childhood physical \\nand/or sexual abuse; death, divorce, or other trauma in the family; persistent serious family conflict; \\ntraumatic breakups of romantic relationships; trouble with the law; school failures and other major \\ndisappointments; and bullying, harassment, or victimization by peers.  \\nIt is important to remember that the vast majority of teens who experience even very stressful life \\nevents do not become suicidal. In some cases, such experiences can be a catalyst for suicidal behavior in \\nteens who are already struggling with depression or other mental health problems. In others, traumatic \\nexperiences (such as prolonged bullying) can precipitate depression, anxiety, abuse of alcohol or drugs, \\nor another mental disorder, which can increase suicide risk. Conversely, existing mental disorders may \\nalso lead to stressful life experiences such as family conflict, social isolation, relationship breakups, or \\nschool failures, which may exacerbate the underlying illness and in turn increase suicide risk.\\nWarning Signs of Suicide\\nThese signs may mean someone is at risk for suicide. Risk is greater if a behavior is new or has recently \\nincreased in frequency or intensity, and if it seems related to a painful event, loss, or change.\\nвЂў Talking about wanting to die or kill oneself\\nвЂў Looking for ways to kill oneself, such as searching online or buying a gun\\nвЂў Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live\\nвЂў Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain\\nвЂў Talking about being a burden to others\\nвЂў Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs\\nвЂў Acting anxious or agitated, or behaving recklessly\\nвЂў Sleeping too little or too much\\nвЂў Withdrawing or feeling isolated\\nвЂў Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge\\nвЂў Displaying extreme mood swings вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 1\\nWhat to Do in a Crisis\\nTake any threat or talk about suicide seriously. Start by telling the person that you are concerned. DonвЂ™t \\nbe afraid to ask whether she or he is considering suicide or has a plan or method in mind. Resist the \\ntemptation to argue the person out of suicide by saying, вЂњYou have so much to live forвЂќ or вЂњYour suicide \\nwill hurt your family and friends.вЂќ Instead, seek professional help.\\nIn an acute crisis:\\nвЂў Call 911.\\nвЂў Do not leave the person alone.\\nвЂў If safe to do so, remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs, or sharp objects that could be used.\\nвЂў Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\\nвЂў Take the person to an emergency room or walk-in clinic at a psychiatric hospital.\\nSymptoms of Mental Disorders Associated with Suicide Risk\\nMost adults are not trained to recognize signs of serious mental disorders in teens, and symptoms are \\ntherefore often misinterpreted or attributed to normal adolescent mood swings, laziness, poor attitude, \\nor immaturity. Diagnosis of a mental disorder should always be made by a qualified mental  \\nhealth professional. \\nThe key symptoms of major depressive disorder  in teens are sad, depressed, angry, or irritable mood and \\nlack of interest or pleasure in activities the teen used to enjoy, lasting at least two weeks. Symptoms \\nrepresent a clear change from the personвЂ™s normal behavior and may include changes in appetite or sleep, \\nfeelings of worthlessness/guilt, inability to concentrate, slowed or agitated movement, recurrent thoughts \\nof death or suicide, fatigue/loss of energy, and self-harm behavior.\\nSometimes referred to as manic depression, bipolar disorder  includes alternating episodes of depression \\nand mania. Symptoms of mania last at least one week, cause clear social or academic problems, and \\ninclude extreme distractibility, lack of need for sleep, unusually rapid speech or motor activity, excessive \\ntalking, and involvement in risky activities such as gambling or irresponsible sexual behavior. \\nThe key characteristic of generalized anxiety disorder  is excessive, uncontrolled worry (for example, \\npersistent worry about tests or speaking in class) occurring on most days for a period of six months. \\nSymptoms may include restlessness or feeling keyed up, irritability, being easily fatigued, muscle tension, \\ndifficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances.\\nTeens with substance use disorder  show a problematic pattern of drug or alcohol use over 12 months \\nor more, leading to significant impairment or distress. Symptoms include taking larger amounts, over \\na longer period, than intended; continued use despite knowing that it is causing problems; increased \\nirritability and anger; sleep disturbances; and family conflict over substance use.\\nConduct disorder  is a repetitive, persistent pattern in children or adolescents of violating the rights of \\nothers, rules, or social norms, occurring over 12 months. Symptoms include bullying or threatening \\nothers, physical fights, fire-setting, destroying property, breaking into houses/cars, physical cruelty to \\npeople or animals, lying, shoplifting, running away from home, and frequent truancy.\\nAnorexia nervosa and bulimia are eating disorders  that are strongly linked to other mental disorders, \\nespecially depression and anxiety. Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include refusal to maintain body AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 1\\nweight at a minimally normal level for age and height, intense fear of gaining weight, and a denial of \\nlow body weight. Symptoms of bulimia include repeated episodes of binge eating (at least twice a week \\nfor three months) combined with recurrent inappropriate behaviors to avoid gaining weight such as \\nvomiting, misuse of laxatives, or excessive exercise. \\nHelp Is Available\\nIf there are concerns about a studentвЂ™s emotional or mental health, a referral should be made to an \\nappropriate mental health professional for assessment, diagnosis, and possible treatment. Mental \\nhealth resources that may be available include school counselors, community mental health agencies, \\nemergency psychiatric screening centers, and childrenвЂ™s mobile response programs. Pediatricians and \\nprimary care providers can also be a source of mental health referrals.\\nSome depressed teens show improvement in just four to six weeks with talk therapy alone. Most others \\nexperience a significant reduction of depressive symptoms with antidepressant medication. Medication is \\nusually essential in treating severe depression and other serious mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder \\nand schizophrenia. Since 2004, an FDA warning has recommended close monitoring of youth taking \\nantidepressants for worsening of symptoms, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and other changes. Risks \\nof medication must be weighed against the risks of not effectively treating depression or other serious \\nmental disorders.  \\n(Adapted with permission from More Than Sad: Preventing T een Suicide , American Foundation for \\nSuicide Prevention, http://www.morethansad.org .)\\nAdditional Information\\nCenter for School Mental Health Assistance .

The following are strategies that schools can use to help students \\nbalance the timing and intensity of their emotional expression and restore the schoolвЂ™s ability to \\nfunction effectively.\\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe term emotional regulation  refers to a personвЂ™s ability to appropriately experience and express \\nintense emotions such as grief and fear. Most adolescents have mastered basic skills that allow \\nthem to handle strong emotions encountered day to day. But these skills may be challenged \\nin the face of a suicide. In addition, young people may not yet have learned how to recognize \\ncomplex feelings or physical indicators of distress, such as stomach upset, restlessness, or \\ninsomnia. Moreover, adolescence marks a time of increased risk for difficulties with emotional \\nregulation, given the intensification of emotional responses that come with puberty and the \\nstructural changes in the brain that occur during this developmental period. \\nIt is therefore important for schools to provide students with appropriate opportunities to express \\ntheir emotions and identify strategies for managing them, so the school can continue its primary \\nfocus of education. It may also be useful for school staff to identify and reach out to families of \\nstudents who are not coming to school. \\nWhen implementing these strategies, leadership will most likely be provided by the school \\ncounselor, school nurse, and/or community mental health partner, all of whom should be \\nmembers of the schoolвЂ™s Crisis Response Team. However, all adults in the school community can \\nhelp by modeling calm, caring, and thoughtful behavior. \\nSchedule Meetings with Students in Small Groups\\nIt will likely be necessary to adjust the regular academic schedule in order to spend time with \\nstudents to help address their emotional needs. It is preferable to reach out to students in a \\ndeliberate and timely way rather than to allow the emotional environment to escalate. It is also \\npreferable to meet with students in small groups, which enables adults to identify those youth \\nwho appear in need of additional attention. \\nIf possible, have counselors go into the classrooms to give students accurate information about \\nsuicide, the kinds of reactions that can be expected after hearing about a peerвЂ™s suicide death, and \\nsafe coping strategies to help them in the coming days and weeks.\\nWherever possible, group meetings should follow a structured outline, keep to a time limit, \\nand provide each student with an opportunity to speak. The meetings should focus on helping \\nstudents identify and express their feelings and discuss practical coping strategies (including \\nappropriate ways to memorialize the loss) so they may return their focus to their regular routines \\nand activities.вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 130\\nIf the deceased student participated in sports, clubs, or other school activities, the first practice, \\ngame, rehearsal, or meeting after the death may be difficult for the other students. These events \\ncan provide further opportunities for the adults in the school community to help the students \\nappropriately acknowledge the loss.\\nHelp Students Identify and Express Their Emotions  \\nYouth will vary widely in terms of emotional expression. Some may become openly emotional, \\nothers may be reluctant to talk at all, and still others may use humor. Acknowledge the breadth \\nof feelings and diversity of experiences and emphasize the importance of being respectful  \\nof others.\\nSome students may need help to identify emotions beyond simply sad, angry, or happy, and \\nmay need reassurance that a wide range of feelings and experiences are to be expected. They may \\nalso need to be reminded that emotions may be experienced as physical symptoms, including \\nbutterflies in the stomach, shortness of breath, insomnia, fatigue, or irritability. To facilitate this \\ndiscussion, students may be asked:\\n What is your biggest concern about the immediate future?\\n What would help you feel safer right now?\\nPractical Coping Strategies\\nEncourage students to think about specific things they can do when intense emotions such as \\nworry or sadness begin to well up, including:\\nвЂў simple relaxation and distraction skills, such as taking three deep slow breaths, counting to 10,  \\n or picturing themselves in a favorite calm and relaxing place\\nвЂў engaging in favorite activities or hobbies such as music, talking with a friend, reading, or going  \\n to a movie \\nвЂў exercising \\nвЂў thinking about how theyвЂ™ve coped with difficulties in the past and reminding themselves that  \\n they can use those same coping skills now\\nвЂў writing a list of people they can turn to for support \\nвЂў writing a list of things theyвЂ™re looking forward to\\nвЂў focusing on individual goals, such as returning to a shared class or spending time with \\n mutual friends\\nOften, youth will express guilt about having fun or thinking about other things. They may feel \\nthat they somehow need permission to engage in activities that will help them feel better and \\ntake their mind off the stressful situation.\\nStudents should also be encouraged to think about how they want to remember their friend. \\nIdeas range from writing a personal note to the family, to attending the memorial service, to \\ndoing something kind for another person in honor of their friend. Be sure to educate students \\nabout the schoolвЂ™s guidelines regarding memorialization . Acknowledging their need to express \\ntheir feelings while helping them identify appropriate ways to do so can begin the process of \\nreturning their focus to their daily lives and responsibilities. AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 131\\nReach Out to Parents\\nParents may need guidance on Talking About Suicide  with their children and how best to \\nsupport them at this difficult time. They may also need reliable information relating to the \\ndocument Facts About Mental Disorders and Suicide in Adolescents . \\nAnniversary of the Death\\nThe anniversary of the death (and other significant dates, such as the deceasedвЂ™s birthday) may \\nstir up emotions and can be an upsetting time for some students and staff. It is helpful to \\nanticipate this and provide an opportunity to acknowledge the date, particularly with those \\nstudents who were especially close to the student who died.\\nAdditional Information\\nBonner, C  .

For example, a school may be able to offer relevant information (such as the likely \\nturnout at the funeral) and anticipate problems (such as the possibility that students may gather \\nlate at night at the place where the deceased died). A coordinated approach can be especially \\ncritical when the suicide death receives a great deal of media coverage and the entire community \\nbecomes involved.\\nCoroner/Medical Examiner\\nThe coroner or medical examiner is the best starting point for confirming that the death has \\nin fact been declared a suicide. (In some cases, it may also be necessary to contact the police \\ndepartment to verify the information). It is important that schools Get The Facts First  and \\nascertain that all information is accurate before communicating with students.\\nHowever, given how quickly news and rumors spread (including through media coverage, e-mail, \\ntexting, and social networking sites), schools may not be able to wait for a final determination \\nbefore they need to begin communicating with the students. In those cases, schools can say, вЂњAt \\nthis time, this is what we knowвЂ¦вЂќ \\nThere may also be cases in which there is disagreement between the authorities and the family \\nregarding the cause of death. For example, the death may have been declared a probable suicide \\nbut the family believes it to have been a homicide or an accident. Or the death may have been \\ndeclared a suicide, but the family does not want this communicated, perhaps due to stigma, for \\nfear of risking contagion, or because they simply do not (yet) believe or accept that it was suicide. \\nSchools have a responsibility to balance the need to be truthful with the school community while \\nremaining sensitive to the family. They can take this opportunity to educate the community \\n(including potentially vulnerable students) about the causes and complexity of suicide and to \\nidentify available mental health resources. For example, a school might say, вЂњAccording to the \\nmedical examiner, the death has been declared a suicide. It can sometimes be difficult for us to \\nbe absolutely sure whether a death was intentional or not (for example, in the case of a drug \\noverdose or a motor vehicle accident involving a single vehicle). While we may never know all \\nof the details, we are deeply saddened, and want to take this opportunity to teach you some \\nimportant information about suicide and where you can find help.вЂќвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 133\\nOf course, if a legal gag order is in effect, the school attorney should first research the applicable \\nstate law regarding discussing the cause of death before the school issues a statement.\\nPolice Department\\nThe police will likely be an important source of information about the death, particularly if there \\nis an ongoing investigation (for example, if it has not yet been determined whether the death \\nwas suicide or homicide). The school will need to be in close communication with the police to \\ndetermine (a) what they can and cannot say to the school community so as not to interfere with \\nthe investigation, and (b) whether there are certain students who must be interviewed by the \\npolice before the school can debrief or counsel them in any way.  \\nThere may also be situations in which the school has information thatвЂ™s relevant to the ability of \\nthe police to keep students safe. For example, the school may become aware that students have \\nestablished a memorial off-campus and may even be engaging in dangerous behavior (such as \\ngathering in large groups at the site of the death at night or holding vigils at which alcohol is \\nbeing consumed) and may need to enlist the cooperation of the police to keep the students safe. \\nThe school may also be in a unique position to brief the police (and even the family) about what \\nto expect at the funeral or memorial service in terms of turnout and other safety concerns. \\nMayorвЂ™s Office and Local Government\\nA student suicide death may reveal an underlying community-wide problem such as drug or \\nalcohol use, bullying, gang violence, or a possible community-wide suicide cluster.  Because \\nschools function withinвЂ”not separate fromвЂ”the surrounding community, local government \\nentities such as the mayorвЂ™s office can be helpful partners in promoting dialogue and presenting a \\nunited front in the interest of protecting the communityвЂ™s young people. \\nFuneral Director\\nThe school and funeral home are complementary sources of information for the community. \\nSchools are often in an excellent position to give the funeral director a heads-up about what \\nto expect at the funeral in terms of the number and types of students likely to attend, and the \\npossible need to have additional security present. The school can also provide information \\nabout local counseling and other resources to the funeral directors, with the request that the \\ninformation be made available to attendees at the funeral.\\nSchools can ask the funeral director to provide (or recommend) materials that the school could \\nprovide to students to help them prepare for the funeral. Schools can also encourage the funeral \\ndirector to talk to the family about the importance of scheduling the service outside of school \\nhours, encouraging studentsвЂ™ parents to attend, and providing counselors to meet with distraught \\nstudents after the service (and the need for a quiet area in which to do so).\\nClergy\\nBecause the school may be in the best position to understand the risk of contagion, it can play \\nan important role by encouraging a dialogue between the family and the clergy (or whomever \\nwill be officiating at the service) to help sensitize them to the issue. This dialogue may provide an \\nopportunity to explain the importance of not inadvertently romanticizing either the student or AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 134\\nthe death in the eulogy, but instead emphasizing the connection between suicide and underlying \\nmental health issues such as depression or anxiety, which can cause substantial psychological pain \\nbut may not be apparent to others (or may manifest as behavioral problems or substance abuse).\\nOf course, if the school has a religious affiliation, it will be important to include clergy who are \\non staff in any communications and outreach efforts to support the student body, and encourage \\nthem to be familiar with their faithвЂ™s current understanding of the relationship between mental \\nillness and suicide.\\nMental Health and Medical Communities\\nMost schools have counselors on staff, and it is important that these individuals are linked to \\nother mental health professionals in the community. In particular, it is advisable that the school \\nestablish an ongoing relationship with a community mental health center that can see students \\nin the event of a psychiatric emergency. In the aftermath of a suicide death, schools will want to \\nnotify the center to ensure seamless referrals if students show signs of distress. Schools will also \\nwant to publicize crisis hotline numbers such as Lifeline: 800-273-TALK (8255). \\nIn addition, schools can encourage the local medical community, including primary care doctors \\nand pediatricians, to screen for depression, substance abuse, and other relevant disorders in the \\nyouth they see.\\nOutside Trauma Responders \\nWorking with schools in the aftermath of a suicide death can easily exhaust school crisis team \\nmembers, which can interfere with their ability to effectively assist the students. Bringing in \\ntrained trauma responders from other school districts or local mental health or crisis centers to \\nwork alongside the schoolвЂ™s crisis team membersвЂ”and to provide care for the caregiversвЂ”can be \\nquite helpful. \\nCommunity Organizations\\nSchools may also wish to network with their local chapter of the American Foundation for \\nSuicide Prevention and with suicide bereavement support groups (see http://www  .afsp .org ).\\nAdditional Information\\nSPAN USA and Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC) .

It can be challenging for schools to strike a \\nbalance between compassionately meeting the needs of distraught students while preserving the \\nability of the school to fulfill its primary purpose of education. In the case of suicide, schools \\nmust consider how to appropriately memorialize the student who died without risking suicide \\ncontagion among other students who may themselves be at risk. \\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nIt is very important that schools strive to treat all deaths in the same way. Having one approach \\nfor memorializing a student who died of cancer or in a car accident and a different approach for \\na student who died by suicide reinforces stigma and may be deeply and unfairly painful to the \\nstudentвЂ™s family and friends.\\nNevertheless, because adolescents are especially vulnerable to the risk of suicide contagion , \\nitвЂ™s equally important to memorialize the student in a way that doesnвЂ™t inadvertently glamorize \\nor romanticize either the student or the death. Schools can do this by seeking opportunities \\nto emphasize the connection between suicide and underlying mental health issues such as \\ndepression or anxiety that can cause substantial psychological pain but may not be apparent to \\nothers (or that may manifest as behavioral problems or substance abuse).\\nWherever possible, schools should both meet with the studentвЂ™s friends and coordinate with the \\nfamily, in the interest of identifying a meaningful, safe approach to acknowledging the loss. This \\nsection includes several creative suggestions for memorializing students who have died by suicide.\\nFunerals and Memorial Services\\nAll the recommendations made here focus on keeping the regular school schedule intact to the \\nmaximum extent possible for the benefit of the entire student body (including those who may \\nnot have known the deceased). \\nWhile at first glance schools may appear to provide an obvious setting for a funeral or memorial \\nservice because of their connection to the community and their ability to accommodate a large \\ncrowd, it is strongly advised that such services not be held on school grounds, to enable the \\nschool to focus instead on maintaining its regular schedule, structure, and routine. Additionally, \\nusing a room in the school for a funeral service can inextricably connect that space to the death, \\nmaking it difficult for students to return there for regular classes or activities. \\nIn situations where school personnel are able to collaborate with the family regarding the funeral \\nor memorial service arrangements, it is also strongly advised that the service be held outside  of \\nschool hours.  \\nIf the family does hold the service during school hours, it is recommended that school remain \\nopen and that school buses not be used to transport students to and from the service. Students \\nshould be permitted to leave school to attend the service only with appropriate parental permis-\\nsion (regular school protocols should be followed for dismissing students over the age of majority). вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 136\\nIf possible, the school should coordinate with the family and funeral director to arrange for \\ncounselors to attend the service. A guide for funeral directors is available at  \\nhttp://www.sprc.org/library/funeraldirectors.pdf . In all cases, the principal or another senior \\nadministrator should attend the funeral.\\nSchools should strongly encourage parents whose children express an interest in attending the \\nfuneral to attend with them. This provides not only emotional support but also an opportunity \\nfor parents to open a discussion with their children and remind them that help is available if they \\nor a friend are in need.\\nSpontaneous Memorials\\nIn the immediate aftermath of a suicide death, it is not unusual for students to create a \\nspontaneous memorial by leaving flowers, cards, poems, pictures, stuffed animals, or other items \\nin a place closely associated with the student, such as his or her locker or classroom seat, or at \\nthe site where the student died. Students may even come to school wearing t-shirts or buttons \\nbearing photographs of the deceased student.\\nThe schoolвЂ™s goal should be to balance the studentsвЂ™ need to grieve with the goal of limiting the \\nrisk of inadvertently glamorizing the death. In all cases, schools should have a consistent policy \\nso that suicide deaths are handled in the same manner as any other deaths. A combination \\nof time limits and straightforward communication can help to restore equilibrium and avoid \\nglamorizing the death in ways that may increase the risk of contagion. Although it may in \\nsome cases be necessary to set limits for students, it is important to do so with compassion and \\nsensitivity, offering creative suggestions  whenever possible. For example, schools may wish \\nto make posterboard and markers available so that students can gather and write messages. It \\nis advisable to set up the posters in an area that may be avoided by those who donвЂ™t wish to \\nparticipate (i.e., not in the cafeteria or at the front entrance). After a few days, the posters can be \\nremoved and offered to the family.\\nWhen a memorial is spontaneously created on school grounds, schools are advised to monitor it \\nfor messages that may be inappropriate (hostile or inflammatory) or that indicate students who \\nmay themselves be at risk. Schools can leave such memorials in place until after the funeral (or \\nfor up to approximately five days), after which the tribute objects may be offered to the family. \\nIt is generally not necessary to prohibit access to the site or to cordon it off, which would merely \\ndraw excessive attention to it. \\nIt is recommended that schools discourage requests to create and distribute t-shirts and buttons \\nbearing images of the deceased by explaining that, while these items may be comforting to some \\nstudents, they may be quite upsetting to others. If students come to school wearing such items \\nwithout first seeking permission, it is recommended that they be allowed to wear the items for \\nthat day only, and that it should be explained to them that repeatedly bringing images of the \\ndeceased student into the school can be disruptive and can glamorize suicide.\\nSince the emptiness of the deceased studentвЂ™s chair can be unsettling and evocative, after \\napproximately five days (or after the funeral), seat assignments may be re-arranged to create a \\nnew environment. Teachers should explain in advance that the intention is to strike a balance \\nbetween compassionately honoring the student who has died while at the same time returning AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 137\\nthe focus back to the classroom curriculum. The students can be involved in planning how to \\nrespectfully remove the desk; for example, they could read a statement that emphasizes their love \\nfor their friend and their commitment to work to eradicate suicide in his or her memory.\\nWhen a spontaneous memorial occurs off school grounds, the schoolвЂ™s ability to exert influence is \\nlimited. It can, nevertheless, encourage a responsible approach among the students by explaining \\nthat it is recommended that memorials be time-limited (again, approximately five days, or until \\nafter the funeral), at which point the memorial would be disassembled and the items offered \\nto the family. Another approach is to suggest that the students participate in a (supervised) \\nceremony to disassemble the memorial, during which music could be played and students could \\nbe permitted to take part of it home; the rest of the items would then be offered to the family.\\nStudents may also hold spontaneous gatherings or candlelight vigils. Schools should discourage \\ngatherings that are large and unsupervised; when necessary, administrators may consider enlisting \\nthe cooperation of local police  to monitor off-campus sites for safety. Counselors can also be \\nenlisted to attend these gatherings to offer support, guidance, and supervision.\\nIt is not recommended that flags be flown at half-staff (a decision generally made by local \\ngovernment authorities rather than the school administration in any event).\\nSchool Newspapers\\nCoverage of the studentвЂ™s death in the school newspaper may be seen as a kind of memorial; also, \\narticles can be used to educate students about suicide warning signs and available resources. It is \\nstrongly recommended that any such coverage be reviewed by an adult to ensure that it conforms \\nto the standards set forth in Reporting on Suicide: Recommendations for the Media , which \\nwas created by the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations.\\nEvents\\nThe studentвЂ™s classmates may wish to dedicate an event (such as a dance performance, poetry \\nreading, or sporting event) to the memory of their friend. End-of-the-year activities may raise \\nquestions of whether to award a posthumous degree or prize, or include a video tribute to the \\ndeceased student during graduation. The guiding principle is that all deaths should be treated \\nthe same way. Schools may also wish to encourage the studentвЂ™s friends to consider creative \\nsuggestions , such as organizing a suicide prevention-awareness or fundraising event.\\nOften, the parents of the deceased student express an interest in holding an assembly or other \\nevent to address the student body and describe the intense pain the suicide death has caused \\nto their family in the hopes that this will dissuade other students from taking their own lives. \\nWhile it is surely understandable that bereaved parents would wish to prevent another suicide \\ndeath, schools are strongly advised to explain that this is not an effective approach to suicide \\nprevention and may in fact even be risky, because students who are suffering from depression or \\nother mental health issues may hear the messaging very differently from the way it is intended, \\nand may even become more likely to act on their suicidal thoughts. Instead, parents should \\nbe encouraged to work with the school to bring an appropriate educational program to the \\nschool, such as More Than Sad: T een Depression , a DVD that educates teens about the signs and AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 138\\nsymptoms of depression (available at http://www.morethansad.org ) or others that are listed \\nin the Suicide Prevention Resource Center/American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Best \\nPractices Registry (available at http://www.sprc.org ).\\nYearbooks\\nAgain, the guiding principle is that all deaths should be treated the same way. So if there is a \\nhistory of dedicating the yearbook (or a page of the yearbook) to students who have died, that \\npolicy is equally applicable to a student who has died by suicide, provided that final editorial \\ndecisions are made by an adult. \\nWhenever possible, the focus should be on mental health and/or suicide prevention. For \\nexample, underneath the studentвЂ™s picture it might say, вЂњIn your memory we will work to erase \\nthe stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide.вЂќ The page might also include pictures of \\nclassmates engaging in a suicide prevention event such as an Out of the Darkness community \\nwalk ( http://www.outofthedarkness.org ).\\nGraduation \\nIf there is a tradition of including a tribute to deceased students who would have graduated with \\nthe class, students who have died by suicide should likewise be included. For example, schools \\nmay wish to include a brief statement acknowledging and naming those students from the \\ngraduating class who have died. Final decisions about what to include in such tributes should be \\nmade by an adult.\\nPermanent Memorials and Scholarships \\nSome communities wish to establish a permanent memorial (sometimes physical, such \\nas planting a tree or installing a bench or plaque; sometimes commemorative, such as a \\nscholarship). Others are afraid to do so.\\nWhile there is no research to suggest that permanent memorials per se create a risk of contagion, \\nthey can prove to be upsetting reminders to bereaved students, and therefore disruptive to \\nthe schoolвЂ™s goal of maintaining emotional regulation. Whenever possible, therefore, it is \\nrecommended that they be established off school grounds. Moreover, the school should bear in \\nmind that once it plants a tree, puts up a plaque, installs a park bench, or establishes a named \\nscholarship for one deceased student, it should be prepared to do so for others, which can \\nbecome quite difficult to sustain over time.\\nCreative Suggestions\\nSome schools may resist allowing any kind of memorialization at all, clamping down on any \\nstudent desire to publicly acknowledge the death for fear of glamorizing suicide and risking \\nsuicide contagion . But simply prohibiting any and all memorialization is problematic in its \\nown rightвЂ”it is deeply stigmatizing to the studentвЂ™s family and friends, and can generate intense \\nnegative reactions, which can exacerbate an already difficult situation and undermine the schoolвЂ™s \\nefforts to protect the student bodyвЂ™s emotional regulation. \\nSchools can play an important role in channeling the energy and passion of the students (and \\ngreater community) in a positive direction, balancing the communityвЂ™s need to grieve with the AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 139\\nimpact that the proposed activity will likely have on students, particularly those who were closest \\nto the student who died.  \\nIt can be helpful for schools to proactively suggest a meeting with the studentвЂ™s close friends \\nto talk about the type and timing of any memorialization. This can provide an important \\nopportunity for the students to be heard and for the school to sensitively explain its rationale \\nfor permitting certain kinds of activities and not others. Schools may even wish to establish a \\nstanding committee composed of students, school administrators, and family members that can \\nbe convened on an as-needed basis.\\nIt can also be helpful for schools to come equipped with specific, constructive suggestions for safe \\nmemorialization, such as:\\nвЂў holding a day of community service or creating a school-based community service program in \\nhonor of the deceased\\nвЂў putting together a team to participate in an awareness or fundraising event sponsored by \\none of the national mental health or suicide prevention organizations (e.g., http://www.\\noutofthedarkness.org ), or holding a local fundraising event to support a local crisis hotline or \\nother suicide prevention program\\nвЂў sponsoring a mental health awareness day\\nвЂў purchasing books on mental health for the school or local library\\nвЂў working with the administration to develop and implement a curriculum focused on effective \\nproblem-solving\\nвЂў volunteering at a community crisis hotline\\nвЂў raising funds to help the family defray their funeral expenses\\nвЂў making a book available in the school office for several weeks in which students can write \\nmessages to the family, share memories of the deceased, or offer condolences; the book can \\nthen be presented to the family on behalf of the school community \\nAdditional Information\\nCentre for Suicide Prevention (Calgary) .

In the emotionally charged \\natmosphere that can follow a suicide death, schools may be inclined to try to control or stifle \\nsuch communications by studentsвЂ”a task that is virtually impossible in any event, since they \\ngenerally take place outside of school hours and property. Schools can, however, utilize social \\nmedia effectively to disseminate information and promote suicide prevention efforts.\\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\\nFollowing a suicide death, students may immediately turn to social media for a variety of \\npurposes, including transmitting news about the death (both accurate and rumored), calling \\nfor impromptu gatherings (both safe and unsafe), creating online memorials (both moving and \\nrisky), and posting messages (both appropriate and hostile) about the deceased.\\nAlthough schools may initially consider social media to be outside of its traditional jurisdiction, \\nthey can in fact collaborate with students and utilize these tools to disseminate important \\nand accurate information to the school community, identify students who may be in need of \\nadditional support or further intervention, share resources for grief support and mental health \\ncare, and promote safe messages that emphasize suicide prevention and minimize the risk of \\nsuicide contagion.\\nInvolve Students \\nIt can be very beneficial for a designated member of the Crisis Response Team (ideally someone \\nfrom the schoolвЂ™s information technology department) to reach out to friends of the deceased \\nand other key students to work collaboratively in this area. Working in partnership with student \\nleaders will enhance the credibility and effectiveness of social media efforts, since the students \\nthemselves are in the best position to help identify the particular media favored by the student \\nbody, engage their peers in honoring their friendвЂ™s life appropriately and safely, and inform \\nschool staff about online communications that may be worrisome.\\nStudents who are recruited to help should be reassured that school staff are only interested \\nin supporting a healthy response to their peerвЂ™s death, not in thwarting communication. \\nThey should also be made aware that staff are available and prepared to intervene if any \\ncommunications reveal cause for concern.\\nDisseminate Information\\nSchools may already have a website and/or an online presence (or page) on one or more social \\nmedia sites; students can help identify others that are currently popular. These can be used to \\nproactively communicate with students, teachers, and parents about:\\nвЂў the funeral or memorial service (schools should of course check with the studentвЂ™s family before \\nsharing information about the funeral) \\nвЂў where students can go for help or meet with counselorsвћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 141\\nвЂў mental illness and the causes of suicide\\nвЂў local mental health resources\\nвЂў the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number: 800-273-TALK (8255)\\nвЂў national suicide prevention organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  \\n(http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org ), the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention  \\n(http://www.afsp.org ), and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center ( http://www.sprc.org ).\\nSchools should emphasize help-seeking and suicide prevention. More specific guidance for \\nsafe message content may be found at http://www.sprc.org/library/SafeMessagingfinal.pdf . \\nStudents can also be enlisted to post this information on their own online pages. \\nOnline Memorial Pages\\nOnline memorial pages and message boards have become common practice in the aftermath of  \\na death.\\nSome schools (with the permission and support of the deceased studentвЂ™s family) may choose \\nto establish a memorial page on the school website or on a social networking site. As with all \\nmemorialization  following a suicide death, such pages should take care not to glamorize the \\ndeath in ways that may lead other at-risk students to identify with the person who died. It is \\ntherefore vital that memorial pages utilize safe messaging, include resources, be monitored by an \\nadult, and be time-limited.\\nIt is recommended that online memorial pages remain active for up to 30 to 60 days after the \\ndeath, at which time they should be taken down and replaced with a statement acknowledging \\nthe caring and supportive messages that had been posted and encouraging students who wish to \\nfurther honor their friend to consider other creative suggestions .\\nIf the studentвЂ™s friends create a memorial page of their own, it is important that school personnel \\ncommunicate with the students to ensure that the page includes safe messaging and accurate \\ninformation. School personnel should also join any student-initiated memorial pages so that they \\ncan monitor and respond as appropriate.\\nMonitor and Respond \\nTo the extent possible, social media sites (including the deceasedвЂ™s wall or personal profile pages) \\nshould be monitored for:\\nвЂў rumors\\nвЂў information about upcoming or impromptu gatherings\\nвЂў derogatory messages about the deceased\\nвЂў messages that bully or victimize current students \\nвЂў comments indicating students who may themselves be at risk\\nResponses may include posting comments that dispel rumors, reinforce the connection \\nbetween mental illness and suicide, and offer resources for mental health care. In some cases, \\nthe appropriate response may go beyond simply posting a comment, safe message, or resource \\ninformation. It may extend to notifying parents and local law enforcement about the need for \\nsecurity at a late-night student gathering, for example.AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 142\\nIn some cases it may be necessary to take action against so-called trolls who may seek out \\nmemorial pages on social media sites and post deliberately offensive messages and pictures. Most \\nsites have a report mechanism or comparable feature, which enables users to notify the site of the \\noffensive material and request that it be removed. The administrator of the memorial page may \\nalso be able to block particular individuals from accessing the site. Because the available options \\nvary from site to site and can evolve over time, schools are advised to contact the particular site \\nfor instructions.\\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has developed an in-depth online postvention manual \\nthat details how to find various social media sites and other online groups, post resources, and \\nreach out to parents. It also includes case examples and resource links and is available at  \\nhttp://www.sprc.org/library/LifelineOnlinePostventionManual.pdf .\\nOn occasion, schools may become aware of posted messages indicating that another student may \\nbe at risk of suicide. Messages of greatest concern may suggest hopelessness or refer to plans to \\njoin the deceased student. In those instances, it may be necessary to alert the studentвЂ™s family \\nand/or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to request that a crisis center follow up \\nwith the student.\\nAdditional Information\\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

In fact, \\nsuicide(s) can even follow the death of a student from other causes, such as an accident. \\nAlthough contagion is comparatively rare (accounting for between 1 percent and 5 percent of \\nall suicide deaths annually), adolescents and teenagers appear to be more susceptible to imitative \\nsuicide than adults, largely because they may identify more readily with the behavior and \\nqualities of their peers. \\nIf there appears to be contagion, schools should consider taking additional steps beyond the \\nbasic crisis response  outlined in this toolkit, including identifying other students who may be at \\nheightened risk of suicide and actively collaborating with community partners in a coordinated \\nsuicide prevention effort.\\nIdentifying Other Students at Possible Risk for Suicide\\nIn the face of apparent contagion, it is important for schools to utilize counselors and others \\nwho have been trained to identify students who may be at heightened risk for suicide due \\nto underlying mental disorders or behavioral problems (such as depression, anxiety, conduct \\ndisorder, and/or substance abuse) and who have been exposed to the prior suicide either directly \\n(by virtue of close identification or relationship with the deceased) or indirectly (by virtue of \\nextensive media coverage).\\nOf special concern are those students who:\\nвЂў have a history of suicide attempts\\nвЂў are dealing with stressful life events such as a death or divorce in the family \\nвЂў were eyewitnesses to the death\\nвЂў are family members or close friends of the deceased (including siblings at other schools as well   \\n as teammates, classmates, and acquaintances of the deceased)\\nвЂў received a phone call, text, or other communication from the deceased foretelling the suicide\\nвЂў may have fought with or bullied the deceased\\nSchools can also seek to identify those in the general student body who may be at heightened \\nrisk by using a mental health screening tool (a process sometimes called case finding) such as \\nTeenScreen Schools and Communities of the National Center for Mental Health Checkups \\n(http://www.teenscreen.org ), Signs of Suicide ( http://www.mentalhealthscreening.org ), \\nor others listed in the Suicide Prevention Resource Center/American Foundation for Suicide \\nPrevention Best Practices Registry ( http://www.sprc.org ).вћІAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 144\\nConnecting with Local Mental Health Resources\\nSchools should work with local primary care and mental health resources (including \\npediatricians, community mental health centers, and local private practice mental health \\nclinicians) to develop plans to refer at-risk youth. Once plans are established, they should be \\nreviewed with school counselors and other personnel so that any student who is identified as \\nbeing at high risk can be referred to a local mental health screening center or private practitioner \\nfor further evaluation.\\nManaging Heightened Emotional Reactions at School \\nThe possibility of a suicide cluster can be exceedingly upsetting. At a minimum, school \\ncounselors and/or trained outside professionals should be available to meet with distraught \\nstudents for grief counseling and to help them make linkages with other resources in the \\ncommunity.\\nSchools, in partnership with community mental health resources, might also consider creating \\ndrop-in centers that provide a safe place for youth to be together after school hours. These \\ncan be staffed by volunteer counselors and clinicians from the community who can provide \\ngrief counseling as well as identify and refer youth who may need additional mental health or \\nsubstance abuse services. These centers can also be used during times of particularly heightened \\nemotion such as graduation or the anniversary of the death(s). \\nMonitoring Media Coverage\\nParticularly when there have been multiple suicides, media interest in the deaths will be intense. \\nThe school should delegate one spokesman for public statements, disseminate the document \\nReporting on Suicide: Recommendations for the Media , and follow the safe messaging \\nguidelines at http://www.sprc.org/library/SafeMessagingfinal.pdf . The risk of contagion is \\nrelated to the amount, duration, and prominenceвЂ”as well as the contentвЂ”of media coverage, so \\nit is extremely important that schools strongly encourage the media to adhere to the parameters \\nset forth by the nationвЂ™s leading suicide prevention organizations. These recommendations include:\\nвЂў not glamorizing or romanticizing the victim or suicide itself\\nвЂў not oversimplifying the causes of suicide\\nвЂў not detailing the method \\nвЂў not including photographs of the death scene or of devastated mourners, which can be    \\n attractive for vulnerable youth who may be desperate for attention and recognition\\nвЂў including hotline numbers (such as Lifeline: 800-273-8255) and information about local   \\n mental health resources in each article\\nBuilding a Community Coalition\\nSchools cannot possibly manage all aspects of reacting to possible contagion and preventing its spread \\nwithout collaborating with community partners . It is strongly recommended that the community \\nconvene a coordinating committee that can meet on a regular basis and serve as a decision-\\nmaking body and identify a leader for these efforts. The committee should include senior AFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 145\\nrepresentation from the school, together with representatives from as many of the following  \\nas possible:  \\nвЂў law enforcement\\nвЂў government, such as the mayorвЂ™s office, medical examinerвЂ™s office, and public health department\\nвЂў parents who have demonstrated community leadership in addressing drug and alcohol abuse,   \\nbullying, or other related issues\\nвЂў mental health community, such as community mental health centers, psychiatric screening   \\ncenters, private practitioners, and substance abuse treatment centers\\nвЂў social service agencies\\nвЂў clergy\\nвЂў funeral directors\\nвЂў first responders and hospital emergency room personnel\\nвЂў media (as coalition members, not to cover it as a news event)\\nвЂў students\\nвЂў suicide bereavement support group facilitators\\nвЂў primary health care providers/clinics\\nThe committeeвЂ™s initial goals should include:\\nвЂў Identifying a leader or lead agency\\nвЂў Identifying any particular risk factors within the community, such as widespread drug and   \\n alcohol use, bullying, or easy access to means of suicide\\nвЂў Mobilizing existing mental health and primary care resources to identify and help young   \\n people who may be at high risk\\nвЂў Mobilizing law enforcement to patrol locations where youth may gather to memorialize the   \\n deceased and/or engage in risky behaviors such as drinking or drug use\\nвЂў Mobilizing parents to assist in monitoring youth who come to their homes and neighborhoods\\nвЂў Reaching out to other groups and businesses in the community where youths gather, such as   \\n recreation centers, religious organizations, sports leagues, movie theaters, and diners\\nThe committee should also consider the gaps in existing resources and identify additional \\nresources that may be needed, such as:  \\nвЂў Creating a position for a suicide prevention resource coordinator \\nвЂў Hiring or contracting for additional counseling staff in affected schools \\nвЂў Hiring staff to provide screening programs in affected schools, such as Columbia Teen Screen\\nвЂў Developing alcohol and drug programs for youth\\nвЂў Developing teen centers where youth can come together and engage in social and recreational   \\n activities with caring adults\\nвЂў Creating a public awareness campaign or website to educate the community about mental   \\n disorders, substance abuse, and other at-risk behaviors, and to decrease stigma and increase   \\n help-seeking. Examples of safe messaging can be found at  \\n http://www.sprc.org/library/SafeMessagingfinal.pdf  \\nвЂў Creating public service campaigns to educate the community about suicide risk factors,    \\n warning signs, and local resources for those at riskAFSP & SPRC:   A F T E R  A  S U I C I D E  | A  T o o l k i t  f o r  S c h o o l s  2 0 1 146\\nвЂў Identifying ways to reach at-risk youth who are not in the education system, such as recent   \\n graduates, dropouts, or those in the juvenile justice system\\nвЂў Identifying and implementing ways to reduce access to means\\nвЂў Exploring eligibility for additional sources of funding, such as a U.S. Department of Education  \\n School Emergency Response to Violence (SERV) grant, awarded to school districts that have   \\n experienced a traumatic event and need additional resources to respond.\\nAdditional Information\\nGould, M .

All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2046, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2047, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2048, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2050, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2055, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2057, 532, 3799, \"All right, now we're recording. All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number. So do I need to just\"), (2058, 594, 3769, \"OK, here we go. All right. So the first thing that I would like to uh to talk about and just drop this into the chat, um You know, we're all friends here, there's no judgment. Uh So the first question is um basically how often are your students writing and this could be writing that they do with you during one on one meetings um in Epic Live classes in pod classes in their core curriculum, just, you know, an approximation of how often they're writing. It could be daily, it could be weekly, monthly, rarely, whatever the case may be. Let's just see kind of the array of responses and we have a few more people coming in. Yeah. Uh So we have one response not very often weekly. Um And that's not surprising. OK. Uh You are not alone if your students are not writing as much as you think that they should, it can be difficult to get students started and we're gonna, we're gonna talk about some strategies for how that can happen. Um But keep in mind the more that we can encourage writing, uh the, the stronger they're going to be as readers too. Another thing to keep in mind is what you might be thinking of as writing, might be like the pinnacle of writing. So, if you think like pro producing an essay is writing, that's true. Ok. Um But there are so many other forms of writing if your students are filling out a graphic organizer that is writing. If your students are, um you know, if your students are writing complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions in their core curriculum because that's an expectation that you have created. Um Then that is writing. Um If they are doing constructed responses, if they do quick writes through no red ink, um There's a lot of different things that, that form this concept of writing. Ok, so we want our students to be able to produce essays, you know, because we're thinking about like the state test for 5th and 8th graders or for 11th grade with the AC T but writing is such a much bigger concept than just what's expected on the state test. So you might be thinking, oh, my students aren't writing nearly enough. Well, the thing is they probably are writing more than you think. Um But you're, you're just not considering what goes into that. All right. So that's some of the strategies that we're going to talk about. Um So once more, I'm going to drop this into the chat and I am going to set somebody who just came in as co-host so that they can. Uh, so Jennifer Rodriguez, you are going to be co-host if you see anybody pop into the, uh the waiting room. Um Please let them in. Um I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen so that we can look at the presentation and go ahead and get started. So, all righty. So once again, I'm Lindsay Headley. I am the secondary ela instructional coach here at Epic. We're going to move pretty briskly through this presentation. But keep in mind what I said earlier, I think fewer people were in the, in the zoom at that time. But keep in mind if you take one thing from this presentation that you can put into practice, then this will be a success. Do not feel like you have to, you know, re invent the wheel on the basis of a single hour of presentation. All right. And if there are things that you see in this presentation and you wanna learn more or you, you wanna see this in action, maybe we could work together. Uh I could co teach a lesson with you. Um Whatever the case may be, uh please reach out, uh I have office hours and I am also super flexible. I will meet when you're able to meet. So first off a quick overview of what we're going to work on, um We're going to talk about the importance of daily writing. Uh go through the writing process and strategies for those specific areas. You might notice if you are super observant that I left off publishing because I didn't think that I would have time. There's a lot that we're going to cover today. Uh We are going to briefly touch on writing on the OS TP and then we are going to talk about writing on this, the sentence level which looks like it is. Yeah, it's there, but it's in white. I didn't change the, the font color writing on the paragraph level and then long form writing. And then of course, my support links for uh you know, office hours and such are in support and additional resources are included as well. So first off, let's talk about daily writing and this has already been touched on briefly as well. Uh So I just finished the online component of letters training and it was very gratifying to see a lot of ideas that I have had from my years of teaching experience confirmed through uh through the work that I did with letters training. Um Basically every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities. And if you think about that, it writing cannot be a, you know, an isolated uh exercise, you know, um it can't be something that you just occasionally talk about because it's building an entire world basically within your students. Um They are connecting the ideas that they pick up through their learning with their own experiences and formulating new ideas. So that is something that is happening all the time. And if you think about it, it's really important that they talk about it starting in kindergarten because kindergartners are some of the most wonderful story tellers in the world. OK. Um So that experience has to be happening every day because they have so much natural creativity that you can use to make them stronger writers and in a connected way stronger readers. Now, daily writing doesn't mean that we're writing full essays every day. I remember we talked about sentence building, we talked about graphic organizers, we talked about um just answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions in their core. So all of those writing activities will improve your students, grammar and comprehension skills and it, and it feeds into one another in a symbiotic relationship. Being a strong writer, makes you a stronger reader, being a strong reader, makes you a better writer and it just feeds off of one another and you know, being able to write and read those translate into success in all other subject areas. So just keep in mind daily writing in some fashion if you can, if you can build that habit in your students, even if it's answering just with complete sentences, you are laying groundwork for success. So the next thing is the writing process. Now, you might have seen this uh if you uh attended the um OK, engage presentations that happened last summer. Um This is actually this infographic is actually from that presentation by Jason Stevenson. And you might notice the traditional arrows going through the process. OK. So the blue arrow is a more traditional process where we start with pre writing and go into drafting, then editing, revising and publishing. But you can see that there's also some places where you kind of skip that process. So for instance, you might go straight from pre writing to publishing. Well as an example, let's say that you have a graphic organizer that you have your students complete as they are reading a mentor text and then that's the assignment. Well, once they turn that assignment in, they have published it. OK? So in the same manner that writing does not always just mean, I wrote an essay publishing does not always mean uh something grandiose like actually putting together a book. If you read it to someone, if you show it to someone, if you turn it in for an assignment, you are publishing. So keep in mind the immediacy of, you know, showing where you are in a stage of writing and, and giving that to your teacher for collaboration or evaluation that can be part of the publishing process. So now let's move into some Prew writing strategies. Prew writing is just the stage of writing where we figure out our topic, we figure out what our audience and purpose is. And we gather and outline or organize our information. So as an example, if we're talking about fifth grade, um in those early grades, a lot of the writing that they do is narrative and structure. OK. So gathering information and uh you know, organizing, it could be as simple as filling out like a story triangle, you know, um select, selecting a topic when we're looking at, let's say test prep is just a question of looking at the prompt and answering it. OK. But that can also be a lot more complicated too. Like if you're doing a research project, selecting a topic could be a pretty involved process. But basically in the Prew writing stage, that's what we're doing. We're figuring out what we're going to write about and, and why and how. So here are questions to ask before you write your task. What am I writing? What is the assignment audience? Who is the audience and purpose? Why am I writing? Answering these questions is important because it gives you an idea of what you're going to be doing with this assignment. But it also answers that very important question of why do I have to do this? Which as we all know, students will ask that and if you don't have a good answer for them, they're probably going to be mentally checked out. So going through this process process of answering these questions is very crucial. Next, we're gonna talk about Prew writing strategies So first off graphic organizers, I've linked in here uh just basically uh kind of a catch all spreadsheet of different types of graphic organizers. And basically any time that I come across a good one, I go ahead and add it in. So there this is being updated pretty consistently. Um Additionally, for pre writing, you can use mentor texts. So this could be something like providing um a reading selection from their core and having them write a reaction to it. Or they could um you know, like write a sequel, like let's say that narratively, uh your students are writing a story. All right, you could have them read a story and then explain what happened next. And then additionally, images. Um So as an example, think back to last October when we did our PLC over engagement, several of our engagement strategies dealt with images. So when you present an image to your students and you're having them write a reaction to it or explain what you think is going on, then you are provoking uh you know, a response. So they're going to be engaged with that and, and visually, that's very powerful. Um So, you know, bear that in mind if you have students who are a little reluctant to read, starting with an image as part of the pre writing strategy can be really strong. I've also linked in some resources as well for images. Uh This is images itself links to the Library of Congress where there are many, many, many resources and then Pix A Bay, which is a copyright free uh resource for images. Um And then also discussion can be a wonderful place for pre writing to occur, especially with students who are reluctant. Um If you wanted to, you know, have that based in discussion where you all generate your Prew writing ideas together, that can really help kids who are reluctant. And also keep in mind that you can combine these different elements to do your Prew writing stage. So you could start with an image and use a graphic organizer. Uh You could use a graphic organizer and a mentor text. You could pair an image with a mentor text, like there's a lot of combinations that can happen there. So don't feel like you have to do of writing assignment in a specific way, the same way every time. So next, let's move on to drafting strategies. So drafting is the portion of writing where we are taking those ideas that we generated in Prew writing and putting them down on paper or putting them into our word document or inside no red ink, whatever our platform is, and we're focusing on ideas instead of conventions. If you've got a student who feels super comfortable, uh you know, writing paragraphs and using transitions and and capitalization and punctuation and all those things like just automatically, that's awesome. That is super, super awesome. But if you have students who are reluctant to write, what you need to focus on is their ideas. Um And then afterward you can show them, you know, how to put that into a more cohesive structure and also how to apply conventions. So let's look at some strategies for drafting. Now, once again, referencing the letters manual, um handwriting, which helps improve memory for letters and words also increases word recognition for reading. So, you know, we are, we are mostly online. OK? But I would really encourage you to consider getting a um or if they've got paper pencil at home, anything like that, because that's building that kinesthetic connection between their brain, which is full of thoughts and ideas and their hands, which is the the way that the words get out. So keep in mind that handwriting is a very powerful tool. Um You can also use mentor text as references and the way that we use mentor texts in drafting is a little different from how we would use it as Prew writing in the pre writing stage. It's more as an inspiration point. OK? But when we're using a mentor text as a reference, we're using it sort of as a guide to help us understand what is this supposed to look like. So a really good example is in the um Oklahoma State Department of Education website. There are example essays of what like a good fifth grade essay looks like what a bad fifth grade essay looks like. And also for eighth grade. So those are really um helpful to show students like here's, here's what we're looking at. When we say an essay, this is what we want. Um If you had your students writing a poem as an example, it would be good to show them what you have in mind. Um uh And obviously, they can, you know, break away from that, they can, you know, be creative and all of those kinds of things. But there are certain expectations and having a mentor text is really helpful for them to be able to identify what those expectations are. Um The next strategy is writing sections out of order. I am, I am very guilty of this. Um because I was a competitive speaker in high school and I always wanted my introductions to be super engaging. Um but I wanted them to match up really well with my body paragraphs. So usually I would write my body paragraphs before I wrote my introduction because it just made the introduction a little bit stronger. Um Another thing to keep in mind with that strategy. Um No red ink is super helpful with that because they divide the sections of the guided drafts up already. So it says like introduction body conclusion. So if you skip around, you're not going to accidentally leave a part out, which can sometimes happen if you are handwriting or working in a Google doc. Another thing you can do though if you are wanting your students to handwrite is that they can label like at the top of each page introduction, flip the page over body paragraphs, flip the page over conclusion and it's perfectly OK to segment out your essay like that. Next. Use those graphic organizers or outlines from Prew writing so that your students don't struggle with what to write another thing to keep in mind. And I, I hate to say this because we're not teaching to the test, but it is important that our students do well on it. Um If you train your students to use graphic organizers, when they sit down to take their state test, they have that scratch paper with them and they can fill it up and ask for another piece of scratch paper, like it's no problem. Um But if they know how to use a graphic organizer and recreate it from memory, then they can use that in the, in the room where they're taking the test. Um It just is a way to give them the tools that they need to be successful. So keep in mind the more often we use graphic organizers and outlines the more successful our students can use or the more successfully our students can use them when they're away from us. Next, we're gonna move into revising. Now. It's important to realize like in normal everyday language, we use revise and edit sort of interchangeably. But in el A they're actually referring to two separate ideas. So revision is content based. OK. So, you know, as an example, let's say that I wrote my body paragraphs for my essay and then I went back and I wrote my introduction and I realized uh when I got done with those body paragraphs, I really wandered away from my thesis statement. So then I would need to change some things up to make sure that I still, you know, was on target for hitting that thesis statement. So with that in mind, OK, editing on the other hand refers to conventions. So let's say I left out um you know, some end punctuation or some capitalization or I, you know, had a really bad habit of misspelling friend, you know, does anyone have that problem where one word consistently is just tricky for them to spell? Um I had a student who would always spell it freind and we worked on that a lot. He was a strong writer in all other regards, that one word was just really tricky for him. So editing is basically, you know, crossing your Ts and dotting your I's and revising. On the other hand, is referring to like the, the meat of the story or the essay. So with that in mind, let's look at some revising strategies. So when we're looking at revising strategies, OK, you wanna give your students the chance to practice revising both on and offline and the reason for that is um interacting with the text is once again a very kin aesthetic activity. There's a lot of techniques you can do um with like highlighters as an example or um you know, just taking up the classic red pen and, and doing some, some constructive revisions. Um and you want your students to be able to, you know, handle that in a concrete manner. Um It can be very abstract or isolating uh to revise on a Google doc when you're learning that those strategies. So just keep in mind um something as simple as printing off an essay and then having your students go through and highlight, um you know, can you highlight your, your thesis statement, can you highlight your topic sentences on your body paragraphs? Um You know, can you show me where you use transition words, just things like that kind of checking to, to see if they understand the organization of their own paper. Um And then once they have learned how to do that offline, they're gonna be better able to do that online. So it doesn't have to be something that you do every single time. But you know, just starting out when they're, they're just learning the process of revision, it can be really helpful to do that online or excuse me offline next. And I kind of referenced this with the first strategy check that each paragraph relates back to the claim and thesis statement. Um And the highlighting strategy can be super helpful with that. Uh Another thing is remove overused words, like really very like um I am particularly uh guilty of using like way too much um in my uh everyday speech. So if I were going to write something down, I would be very, very careful to edit those things out and next check for things like precision of speech and, and that can be a very fun activity for your students. Um You can say, all right, kind of thinking about that offline example, looking at their print out of their paper, I want you to find three vague adjectives and you can give them examples like bad or happy or, you know, whatever the case may be just something that uh could be more specific. And so instead of saying someone felt bad, you could say someone felt ill, ok? That's definitely a different kind of condition than someone s someone felt anxious or someone felt depressed. So keep in mind that precision of, of speech, you know, that can occur um offline and online and also that uh it can be, you know, a very fun activity for your students. And that's something that can also happen pretty easily in a group setting as well. So you might have a student like read a sentence of theirs doesn't have to be the entire paper because that's stressful. Um But they might read a sentence that they're wanting some ideas for a revision on to their to their group, then someone else could say, oh well, what about this word? And then they could put in the word that they are wanting to replace. So keep in mind, revision can be a really fun um activity both individually and as a group. Now this next portion, this is also again from the engage OK presentation by Jason Stevenson. So this strategy basically is checking for sentence variety. Um And what you would have your students do is circle the first words of sentences to check for sentence variety. So if we look at this paragraph, OK. And all of the beginnings of the sentences, you notice that most of them begin with I or we and it, this is a narrative. So obviously, it's going to be centered around the narrator. Um but it's not a very, it's not a very varied paragraph. All right. So what you might do as a as a revision strategy is kind of work out, how could you rephrase some of these sentences, maybe combine them or maybe or rearrange the structure a little bit just so that it's a little bit more interesting. Um And that, that's obviously something that, you know, once you've uh gotten a little more comfortable with it, you can help your students as they go along. Um So revision strategies, next, we're gonna be moving into editing strategies. All right. Now, remember, revision refers more to the content and editing is referring to the conventions. So we're gonna be looking for errors and this can be for grammar usage, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. And keep in mind it's really important that we uh we don't overwhelm our students or ourselves with trying to attain perfection. OK? Because when you get into the editing stra stage, if you are aiming for perfection, you are going to be working on that piece of writing for the rest of your life and you will never get it because there's always different ways that you could fine tune something. Ok. The point of editing is to make sure that any mistakes you've made don't interfere with your message and that is especially true for spelling. I know a lot of people worry, worry about their students spelling, especially thinking about that state test, the the kind of convention with grading state tests like that is spelling is not going to be deducted unless the person grading cannot figure out what the student is trying to say. So as long as they're close and their meaning is understood, they're not going to have points taken off. Um The same thing can be said for other kinds of mistakes. You know, once again, we're not trying to get perfection, we are trying to make sure that our message is as clear as possible. So as an example, if you have students who do a lot of like really rambling sentences, um one thing that you can, um, train them to do is focusing on sentence construction, you know, um, like focus on the thing that limits their meaning from being clear the most. And for some students that is spelling. So that's where you wanna focus. But others, it might be something like sentence structure or, um just, you know, if they have uh grammar mistakes or maybe they speak from a dialect that's a little different or their ell, um you might focus on grammar usage instead, whatever the case may be, every student is going to be different. Um Now let's talk about some editing strategies. OK. So the next, the thing that you want to talk about and I pasted in the top about um editing, you know, just to reinforce, but model using a checklist, like the one students will use on the OS TP or similar checklists. Um So looking at that, this is the one from the Oklahoma State Department of Education and it's the, it's going to be the same for 5th and 8th grade, but this, this goes over both revision and editing strategies. So, uh it's really important that students are familiar with it. All right. And if they just uh are able to check those things off, as, you know, I've looked at this and I've made sure that it's OK. Um Then they're going to feel a little more confident about their writing. So keep in mind, a checklist can be incredibly helpful. Um next, when you're grading essays focus on narrow specific elements. So once again, like, don't overwhelm your students when you're grading an essay. Um If you notice, you know, as an example, if you say we're gonna focus just on sentences, OK, good sentences, clear subjects and verbs and punctuation. That's what I'm looking for. But if you notice as you're going through that, that there are a lot of grammar mistakes or that there's a lot of spelling mistakes, just kind of keep track of that and focus on it for the next assignment. Um But when, when we're trying to work on elements to improve, if we try to do it all at the same time, it can be overwhelming for students, especially if they are reluctant writers or if they are new to the whole writing process. So make sure that you're using rubrics. Um You can access rubrics from the Oklahoma State Department of Ed website or you can use the one that is generated in no red ink for guided drafts or if you want to, you can create your own. Um Just keep that in mind that you've got a lot of examples that you can follow. Next, we are going to be talking about writing on the OS TP. So basically 5th and 8th grade are the two grades where writing is tested. But, you know, as we've talked about earlier, writing is such a crucial, um you know, kind of world building skill um that you do not want to limit writing instruction to just 5th and 8th grade. You want to use those years prior as building stones to, to get your students ready for those exams. So, you know, keep in mind that's a lot of instructional time uh to capitalize on um something else to keep in mind from what we discussed when we were talking about daily writing. Um writing increases student interaction with text. And so the more writing that you're having your students doing, the more that they're going to interact with text, the better they're going to interact with text and then they are going to be better readers as well. So it's, it's just a big circle and that's why I used the image that I have on this slide. Um So make sure that you are giving your students ample time to practice for the writing that they're going to be expected to know how to do when they're 5th and 8th graders. Um Next writing on the O OS TP, there's just two slides for this section. You've got examples which we've referenced before. Um They have examples of 5th and 8th grade writing. They also include rubrics and the checklist. So those are all really uh helpful resources to have um with the exemplars that means that you have an example of writing, you know, um for those of us who are not coming from an el a background or if we're teaching out of a grade band. Then, then we're familiar with having an example of what student writing looks like is essential. The rubrics are also really helpful. But keep in mind that when we're teaching writing, we're gonna focus on maybe just one part of the rubric instead of the entire rubric. And then of course, the checklist is really helpful for your students as well. Um No red ink also has guided drafts that are built around the resources provided by the the state. And that also gives your students the scaffolding that they have from practicing in no red ink with writing, but they have those, those examples, they have those resources, they have the rubric and the checklist. So it's like a combination of two really fantastic resources and also keep in mind um the eighth grade writing practice um that they have provided from the state that's not exclusively for eighth graders. So if I've got 1/6 grader, it's totally ok to have them practicing with the eighth grades, uh prompt. Um you know, it might, you know, it might prove challenging for them, but just remind them that this is practice and they're getting familiar with the kind of writing that they're gonna have to do as an eighth grader. You know, it's, it's really simple to explain, you know, I'm not grading you as if you were an eighth grader. I'm grading you as though you're 1/6 grader, but you're getting exposed to the type of writing, the structure, the form and all of those things are really important to understand as you prepare for that eighth grade test. Next writing on the sentence level. So these next three sections, we're going to be breaking down uh what writing can look like on those various levels and some strategies for teaching them. Um And then we will, you know, kind of build as we go. So we start with sentences, move into paragraphs and finally long form writing. So writing on the sentence level. OK? Um I hear this a lot. We live in a very different age now. Um Our sentence or excuse me, our students are not uh interacting with sentence construction the same way that we did. Um because a lot of their communication and their, their understanding of the world happens through cell phones, um You know, that's just the way of it. So breaking that habit of, you know, text speak, um it can be pretty tricky, but the good thing about it is there's a really easy solution. Um Well, I say easy, I should say simple. Um because it's not exactly easy. The thing is if you have your students practicing writing sentences on a daily basis, it becomes habit and once it becomes habit, it becomes a lot easier to build on that. So this might be the takeaway for a lot of you. Um You know, I, I mentioned one takeaway if you can take one thing away from this presentation, it's writing on the sentence level. Have your students practice writing sentences every single day and it can be a quick writing neritic. It can be answering questions in their core curriculum with complete sentences. It could even be sending you a daily email where they have to write incomplete sentences, whatever the case may be, build that habit, that's essential. Um Otherwise students are not gonna have a good starting point. So um one easy way to start with sentences is sentence builders. And I included a couple of examples or a few examples from the letters manual. So a really basic 12 part sentence builder chart who or what, which represents our subject and then the action. OK. Um If you're really starting from scratch with a student, a two part sentence builder really helps them understand the needs of a sentence that you need a subject and you need a verb. And from there, you can build out more complicated sentences but subject and verb, those are the building blocks. OK? Uh Next you move into the three part sentence builder chart. So you have the who or what and the action and then you have more detail. OK? So you're starting from those very essential building blocks and adding more information. And then we move into the extended sentence builder chart where you're starting to add really cool things like adjectives, more nouns and verbs object, nouns, prepositional phrases, and then it just keeps going on from there. So we start at the very beginning with subjects and verbs and as you build through the the charts with your students, then they're going to be able to put together much more interesting and complicated sentences. Now also keep in mind this is not a a vendor training, but I do talk about no red ink quite a bit because it is a writing supplemental. Um quick writes in no red ink offer sentence, writing exercises to build student skills. So if you've got reluctant writers or kids that, that it just seems like they can't write a sentence to save their life. The quick rights are a good way to start with that. And also keep in mind uh when you make an assignment like that, model it with them. Ok? Um If they've never written before or they've missed a lot of school or they weren't engaged with school for the last couple of years because all kinds of things have been interrupting that they need more modeling. Ok? Um And I know that that's hard to, to dedicate the time to that, but showing them what you expect when they're writing um is really crucial. Um The modeling aspect of writing instruction just ensures that they have an idea in their head of what they're supposed to be working on. Um It can be really hard to put that into a, a concrete concept for a student if they don't have one provided. So just keep that in mind having an example or working through it with them just helps ensure success. So next, we're gonna look at building on the paragraph level. All right. Now, here is a place where visuals are a great way to teach the structure of a paragraph. Um I remember um because when I started working on this presentation, it was just around Thanksgiving. Um I actually remember that one of my grade school teachers had a, a turkey paragraph, like little poster in her room. Um And so, like, you know, anyway, you could probably envision what that looked like, but it was fun and it was, and it was interesting, but I couldn't find a, a representation online. So I found a few other examples. So the, the paragraph um rendered as the hand is a really great one because barring really kind of out there um situations your students are gonna have a hand with them when they go into the testing room. OK. So they could look at their hand and visualize what they have done before with writing. Um So they would know, you know, like the palm of my hand is my main idea. My thumb is my topic, sentence and so on and so forth. That's a really great visual to teach them that will, they can carry with them wherever they go. Um Another thing kind of bringing in that visual element of working offline with an essay is using highlighting colors as they're working through a paragraph. Like, can you highlight your topic sentence? OK. Can you highlight your conclusion? And those can be the same color because those are connected when you have your topic sentence, usually you reiterate it in your conclusion. Um Then your supporting ideas are a different color and your detail sentences are a different color. And when you've got all three of your colors represented, you know that you've covered your bases. Um And then this was another example that I found online of the Oreo paragraph, which what a great visual and also you could bring cookies to your meeting with them and they would probably love you for it. Um But it goes through the process like what do each of these layers, you know, mean when we're constructing a paragraph, this would be really great um for constructed response practice as well because you can see like reason for my opinion, you could easily replace that with text evidence. So just an idea to consider next uh just to continue on um paragraph frames. All right. So a paragraph frame is basically where you're starting off with the the purpose and the mode of the paragraph is already understood and your students are just filling those things in. So basically why paragraph frames are helpful is that they limit um how much your students have to write. So if they're, if your students find it difficult to start. Paragraph frames are a good place to do that. Um They reinforce the structure that's needed and they provide the starts of the ideas. So every sentence has it started already and your students are just filling in what they found or what they know and they provide structure for those students who aren't ready to write full paragraphs all by themselves. So um I also linked in some re uh a link for paragraph frames. So you have some ideas on how to go from there. All right. So moving into the home stretch, long form, writing. All right. Now, if you're like a traditional person, um and not like me who loved writing essays. Uh When you think about essays, it, it's probably with a sense of trepidation or even uh like just revulsion maybe. Um But essays do not have to be painful. OK? One important thing to keep in mind is breaking them up into smaller pieces for your students. So as an example with guided drafts with no red ink, anytime you make an assignment, no red ink, it's gonna give you like a time allotment. You know, it'll say this could take your student anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for a practice assignment, um 10 to 20 minutes on longer assignments. Um but guided drops, it'll say like 90 to 100 and 80 minutes. OK? And when, when people see that they're like Oh, that's a lot of time. It does not have to be like that. Ok? If you think about it 100 and 80 minutes broken up over the course of, of five or six days relates uh to a much shorter amount of time for your students. So keep that in mind that you do not have to uh you know, do a whole essay all in one sitting. Now, obviously with the state test, you do and you wanna try to build in some stamina as your students are going along. But when they're just getting started, it's OK to say we're just gonna work on this for 20 minutes. Um, you know, start small and build from there. It's kind of like running, ok? If a person wants to be a runner, they don't just wake up one day and decide to run a marathon, they'll start by going for a jog through their neighborhood and then they'll build up to a five K and then they'll build up further than that. They don't, um, they don't just wake up one day and, you know, decide I'm gonna write or I'm gonna run for 26 miles and you don't just wake up one day deciding, oh, I'm just gonna write an essay like today, you start small. OK. So it's OK to just have a, an example where you're gonna write like an introductory paragraph with your students or we're gonna write a body paragraph and just work on the structure of that paragraph. You don't have to throw them into the deep end of the pool. Ok. But going back to long form, writing in general beyond the essay. All right, you wanna give your students uh opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes. So, you know, going back to sort of the expectations of eighth grade writing test, they could be tested on three different uh you know, forms. Basically, they could be tested to write a narrative essay, an argumentative essay or an informational essay. Most students are going to feel a little more excited about one form than the other. Um Some kids really love narrative writing, others uh get very like competitive and they really love argumentative writing. Um I can say from personal experience, I did great with argumentative writing. I was a competitive debater in high school. But then other people, they just wanna like, tell you about things that they've learned. And so they really love informational writing. Um The thing is you want to expose your students to a lot of different types of writing um And a lot of different writing exercises so that they can figure out what kind of writer am I? OK. So case in point and I talk about competitive speech a lot because I competed in it in high school and then I coached it for a few years. So I have a lot of examples. There was a student that I judged at competitions, his parents own a petting zoo. And so all of his speeches, regardless of what they were about related to his experience, helping to manage his parents petting zoo. And it was really fun because it gave him a chance to talk about something that he loved. And that is a very important perspective to bring to writing instruction. You're giving your students a chance to talk about things that they enjoy talking about. And you know, you guys know some to generate that spark, they will tell you everything about their day. You sit down to have a meeting with them and you say, well, how are you doing today? And then like 30 minutes later you're OK, you're like, OK, OK, we really have to get on track. Ok. Come on, you know, because they just love talking so much. But then there are those students who are shy or maybe in their life, they don't feel like people have wanted to hear what they have to say. You have to work really hard to reach those students, but it is very valuable to reach them. So, um we talked about the second part when preparing for the state test. Think back to the standards and those three main uh ways of writing, um graphic organizers. We've talked about graphic organizers with Prew writing and also bringing that into the drafting process. Keep in mind once again. This applies especially to long form writing. Um graphic organizers help you stay on track when you are, you know, putting those thoughts down on paper, um providing a mentor text once again is super important to show them what the assignment can look like. And then scaffold as students move through their essays and that can happen in person. But remember that no red ink also offers scaffolding as they work through guided drafts And then finally, um practice using the writers checklist with your students. So once that draft is over, use the checklist with them and say, ok, did you check for this, you know, and, and have them look for those things and, and point to them on the essay, like if it mentions thesis statement, it's like, ok, where is your thesis statement? And if they can't find it, that's time to revise, we need to make sure we have one in there. All right. So we are just about out of time. So I wanted to talk one really quickly about some supports that you can have um with writing instruction. Obviously, the instructional coaches are here to help me, especially with secondary elai. I love to talk about writing. Um But we are also working on PD in January and we have in the past few months as well worked on cross curricular um writing and that's a great way to multiply your time. Um in January specifically, um Tara who does science instructional coaching, and Katie who does social studies instructional coaching and myself, we are going to present on uh practiced and constructed responses across the subject areas. So keep in mind that there's a lot of writing PD coming in January, we can also help with resource location teaching strategies and how you can use your data to guide instruction. So um you can also contact us through fresh service and I also linked in my office hours there. Now, online resources, OK? Um Online resources make it a lot easier to make assignments for your students. So you don't have to try to re invent the wheel every time. Um And they ensure that your students are gonna be comfortable with writing online, which is the format that they will be tested on and it lets your students work asynchronously. And two really great supplements for writing are near pod and no red ink. You can uh you can put writing um you know, prompts into your near pod lessons and have students contribute to that. Um both synchronously and asynchronously and then no red ink of course, is a great writing supplement. Now, another thing to keep in mind, I've talked quite a bit about the importance of offline. Writing offline resources are incredibly important in helping your students build that kinesthetic bond, think of a, think of a rope or a line connecting your brain to your hands. OK? When you work offline, it seems like that kinesthetic bond can be built a lot faster and a lot stronger. So, a composition notebook for your students, highlighters, um white boards, whatever the case may be. Um It's good to have offline resources for writing in math too. If you think about it, that's pretty important too. But that's a different subject area that I'm not even going to touch. All right. Next, additional resources. So I included uh a few resources um from no red ink, the graphic organizers uh spreadsheet is also included and uh how to incorporate writing into your daily routine. And finally, um before we finish up, um if you could click on the survey link or use the QR code um to finish up our survey. This presentation was the wonderful world of writing and I am Lindsay Headley. So when you fill out that survey, I would really appreciate it and that is about it. We have a little bit of time um If anyone has any questions. But otherwise, um you know, I, I wish you a wonderful Friday and I hope to work with you in the future. All righty. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and stop the recording.\"), (2060, 594, 3769, \"OK, here we go. All right. So the first thing that I would like to uh to talk about and just drop this into the chat, um You know, we're all friends here, there's no judgment. Uh So the first question is um basically how often are your students writing and this could be writing that they do with you during one on one meetings um in Epic Live classes in pod classes in their core curriculum, just, you know, an approximation of how often they're writing. It could be daily, it could be weekly, monthly, rarely, whatever the case may be. Let's just see kind of the array of responses and we have a few more people coming in. Yeah. Uh So we have one response not very often weekly. Um And that's not surprising. OK. Uh You are not alone if your students are not writing as much as you think that they should, it can be difficult to get students started and we're gonna, we're gonna talk about some strategies for how that can happen. Um But keep in mind the more that we can encourage writing, uh the, the stronger they're going to be as readers too. Another thing to keep in mind is what you might be thinking of as writing, might be like the pinnacle of writing. So, if you think like pro producing an essay is writing, that's true. Ok. Um But there are so many other forms of writing if your students are filling out a graphic organizer that is writing. If your students are, um you know, if your students are writing complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions in their core curriculum because that's an expectation that you have created. Um Then that is writing. Um If they are doing constructed responses, if they do quick writes through no red ink, um There's a lot of different things that, that form this concept of writing. Ok, so we want our students to be able to produce essays, you know, because we're thinking about like the state test for 5th and 8th graders or for 11th grade with the AC T but writing is such a much bigger concept than just what's expected on the state test. So you might be thinking, oh, my students aren't writing nearly enough. Well, the thing is they probably are writing more than you think. Um But you're, you're just not considering what goes into that. All right. So that's some of the strategies that we're going to talk about. Um So once more, I'm going to drop this into the chat and I am going to set somebody who just came in as co-host so that they can. Uh, so Jennifer Rodriguez, you are going to be co-host if you see anybody pop into the, uh the waiting room. Um Please let them in. Um I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen so that we can look at the presentation and go ahead and get started. So, all righty. So once again, I'm Lindsay Headley. I am the secondary ela instructional coach here at Epic. We're going to move pretty briskly through this presentation. But keep in mind what I said earlier, I think fewer people were in the, in the zoom at that time. But keep in mind if you take one thing from this presentation that you can put into practice, then this will be a success. Do not feel like you have to, you know, re invent the wheel on the basis of a single hour of presentation. All right. And if there are things that you see in this presentation and you wanna learn more or you, you wanna see this in action, maybe we could work together. Uh I could co teach a lesson with you. Um Whatever the case may be, uh please reach out, uh I have office hours and I am also super flexible. I will meet when you're able to meet. So first off a quick overview of what we're going to work on, um We're going to talk about the importance of daily writing. Uh go through the writing process and strategies for those specific areas. You might notice if you are super observant that I left off publishing because I didn't think that I would have time. There's a lot that we're going to cover today. Uh We are going to briefly touch on writing on the OS TP and then we are going to talk about writing on this, the sentence level which looks like it is. Yeah, it's there, but it's in white. I didn't change the, the font color writing on the paragraph level and then long form writing. And then of course, my support links for uh you know, office hours and such are in support and additional resources are included as well. So first off, let's talk about daily writing and this has already been touched on briefly as well. Uh So I just finished the online component of letters training and it was very gratifying to see a lot of ideas that I have had from my years of teaching experience confirmed through uh through the work that I did with letters training. Um Basically every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities. And if you think about that, it writing cannot be a, you know, an isolated uh exercise, you know, um it can't be something that you just occasionally talk about because it's building an entire world basically within your students. Um They are connecting the ideas that they pick up through their learning with their own experiences and formulating new ideas. So that is something that is happening all the time. And if you think about it, it's really important that they talk about it starting in kindergarten because kindergartners are some of the most wonderful story tellers in the world. OK. Um So that experience has to be happening every day because they have so much natural creativity that you can use to make them stronger writers and in a connected way stronger readers. Now, daily writing doesn't mean that we're writing full essays every day. I remember we talked about sentence building, we talked about graphic organizers, we talked about um just answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions in their core. So all of those writing activities will improve your students, grammar and comprehension skills and it, and it feeds into one another in a symbiotic relationship. Being a strong writer, makes you a stronger reader, being a strong reader, makes you a better writer and it just feeds off of one another and you know, being able to write and read those translate into success in all other subject areas. So just keep in mind daily writing in some fashion if you can, if you can build that habit in your students, even if it's answering just with complete sentences, you are laying groundwork for success. So the next thing is the writing process. Now, you might have seen this uh if you uh attended the um OK, engage presentations that happened last summer. Um This is actually this infographic is actually from that presentation by Jason Stevenson. And you might notice the traditional arrows going through the process. OK. So the blue arrow is a more traditional process where we start with pre writing and go into drafting, then editing, revising and publishing. But you can see that there's also some places where you kind of skip that process. So for instance, you might go straight from pre writing to publishing. Well as an example, let's say that you have a graphic organizer that you have your students complete as they are reading a mentor text and then that's the assignment. Well, once they turn that assignment in, they have published it. OK? So in the same manner that writing does not always just mean, I wrote an essay publishing does not always mean uh something grandiose like actually putting together a book. If you read it to someone, if you show it to someone, if you turn it in for an assignment, you are publishing. So keep in mind the immediacy of, you know, showing where you are in a stage of writing and, and giving that to your teacher for collaboration or evaluation that can be part of the publishing process. So now let's move into some Prew writing strategies. Prew writing is just the stage of writing where we figure out our topic, we figure out what our audience and purpose is. And we gather and outline or organize our information. So as an example, if we're talking about fifth grade, um in those early grades, a lot of the writing that they do is narrative and structure. OK. So gathering information and uh you know, organizing, it could be as simple as filling out like a story triangle, you know, um select, selecting a topic when we're looking at, let's say test prep is just a question of looking at the prompt and answering it. OK. But that can also be a lot more complicated too. Like if you're doing a research project, selecting a topic could be a pretty involved process. But basically in the Prew writing stage, that's what we're doing. We're figuring out what we're going to write about and, and why and how. So here are questions to ask before you write your task. What am I writing? What is the assignment audience? Who is the audience and purpose? Why am I writing? Answering these questions is important because it gives you an idea of what you're going to be doing with this assignment. But it also answers that very important question of why do I have to do this? Which as we all know, students will ask that and if you don't have a good answer for them, they're probably going to be mentally checked out. So going through this process process of answering these questions is very crucial. Next, we're gonna talk about Prew writing strategies So first off graphic organizers, I've linked in here uh just basically uh kind of a catch all spreadsheet of different types of graphic organizers. And basically any time that I come across a good one, I go ahead and add it in. So there this is being updated pretty consistently. Um Additionally, for pre writing, you can use mentor texts. So this could be something like providing um a reading selection from their core and having them write a reaction to it. Or they could um you know, like write a sequel, like let's say that narratively, uh your students are writing a story. All right, you could have them read a story and then explain what happened next. And then additionally, images. Um So as an example, think back to last October when we did our PLC over engagement, several of our engagement strategies dealt with images. So when you present an image to your students and you're having them write a reaction to it or explain what you think is going on, then you are provoking uh you know, a response. So they're going to be engaged with that and, and visually, that's very powerful. Um So, you know, bear that in mind if you have students who are a little reluctant to read, starting with an image as part of the pre writing strategy can be really strong. I've also linked in some resources as well for images. Uh This is images itself links to the Library of Congress where there are many, many, many resources and then Pix A Bay, which is a copyright free uh resource for images. Um And then also discussion can be a wonderful place for pre writing to occur, especially with students who are reluctant. Um If you wanted to, you know, have that based in discussion where you all generate your Prew writing ideas together, that can really help kids who are reluctant. And also keep in mind that you can combine these different elements to do your Prew writing stage. So you could start with an image and use a graphic organizer. Uh You could use a graphic organizer and a mentor text. You could pair an image with a mentor text, like there's a lot of combinations that can happen there. So don't feel like you have to do of writing assignment in a specific way, the same way every time. So next, let's move on to drafting strategies. So drafting is the portion of writing where we are taking those ideas that we generated in Prew writing and putting them down on paper or putting them into our word document or inside no red ink, whatever our platform is, and we're focusing on ideas instead of conventions. If you've got a student who feels super comfortable, uh you know, writing paragraphs and using transitions and and capitalization and punctuation and all those things like just automatically, that's awesome. That is super, super awesome. But if you have students who are reluctant to write, what you need to focus on is their ideas. Um And then afterward you can show them, you know, how to put that into a more cohesive structure and also how to apply conventions. So let's look at some strategies for drafting. Now, once again, referencing the letters manual, um handwriting, which helps improve memory for letters and words also increases word recognition for reading. So, you know, we are, we are mostly online. OK? But I would really encourage you to consider getting a um or if they've got paper pencil at home, anything like that, because that's building that kinesthetic connection between their brain, which is full of thoughts and ideas and their hands, which is the the way that the words get out. So keep in mind that handwriting is a very powerful tool. Um You can also use mentor text as references and the way that we use mentor texts in drafting is a little different from how we would use it as Prew writing in the pre writing stage. It's more as an inspiration point. OK? But when we're using a mentor text as a reference, we're using it sort of as a guide to help us understand what is this supposed to look like. So a really good example is in the um Oklahoma State Department of Education website. There are example essays of what like a good fifth grade essay looks like what a bad fifth grade essay looks like. And also for eighth grade. So those are really um helpful to show students like here's, here's what we're looking at. When we say an essay, this is what we want. Um If you had your students writing a poem as an example, it would be good to show them what you have in mind. Um uh And obviously, they can, you know, break away from that, they can, you know, be creative and all of those kinds of things. But there are certain expectations and having a mentor text is really helpful for them to be able to identify what those expectations are. Um The next strategy is writing sections out of order. I am, I am very guilty of this. Um because I was a competitive speaker in high school and I always wanted my introductions to be super engaging. Um but I wanted them to match up really well with my body paragraphs. So usually I would write my body paragraphs before I wrote my introduction because it just made the introduction a little bit stronger. Um Another thing to keep in mind with that strategy. Um No red ink is super helpful with that because they divide the sections of the guided drafts up already. So it says like introduction body conclusion. So if you skip around, you're not going to accidentally leave a part out, which can sometimes happen if you are handwriting or working in a Google doc. Another thing you can do though if you are wanting your students to handwrite is that they can label like at the top of each page introduction, flip the page over body paragraphs, flip the page over conclusion and it's perfectly OK to segment out your essay like that. Next. Use those graphic organizers or outlines from Prew writing so that your students don't struggle with what to write another thing to keep in mind. And I, I hate to say this because we're not teaching to the test, but it is important that our students do well on it. Um If you train your students to use graphic organizers, when they sit down to take their state test, they have that scratch paper with them and they can fill it up and ask for another piece of scratch paper, like it's no problem. Um But if they know how to use a graphic organizer and recreate it from memory, then they can use that in the, in the room where they're taking the test. Um It just is a way to give them the tools that they need to be successful. So keep in mind the more often we use graphic organizers and outlines the more successful our students can use or the more successfully our students can use them when they're away from us. Next, we're gonna move into revising. Now. It's important to realize like in normal everyday language, we use revise and edit sort of interchangeably. But in el A they're actually referring to two separate ideas. So revision is content based. OK. So, you know, as an example, let's say that I wrote my body paragraphs for my essay and then I went back and I wrote my introduction and I realized uh when I got done with those body paragraphs, I really wandered away from my thesis statement. So then I would need to change some things up to make sure that I still, you know, was on target for hitting that thesis statement. So with that in mind, OK, editing on the other hand refers to conventions. So let's say I left out um you know, some end punctuation or some capitalization or I, you know, had a really bad habit of misspelling friend, you know, does anyone have that problem where one word consistently is just tricky for them to spell? Um I had a student who would always spell it freind and we worked on that a lot. He was a strong writer in all other regards, that one word was just really tricky for him. So editing is basically, you know, crossing your Ts and dotting your I's and revising. On the other hand, is referring to like the, the meat of the story or the essay. So with that in mind, let's look at some revising strategies. So when we're looking at revising strategies, OK, you wanna give your students the chance to practice revising both on and offline and the reason for that is um interacting with the text is once again a very kin aesthetic activity. There's a lot of techniques you can do um with like highlighters as an example or um you know, just taking up the classic red pen and, and doing some, some constructive revisions. Um and you want your students to be able to, you know, handle that in a concrete manner. Um It can be very abstract or isolating uh to revise on a Google doc when you're learning that those strategies. So just keep in mind um something as simple as printing off an essay and then having your students go through and highlight, um you know, can you highlight your, your thesis statement, can you highlight your topic sentences on your body paragraphs? Um You know, can you show me where you use transition words, just things like that kind of checking to, to see if they understand the organization of their own paper. Um And then once they have learned how to do that offline, they're gonna be better able to do that online. So it doesn't have to be something that you do every single time. But you know, just starting out when they're, they're just learning the process of revision, it can be really helpful to do that online or excuse me offline next. And I kind of referenced this with the first strategy check that each paragraph relates back to the claim and thesis statement. Um And the highlighting strategy can be super helpful with that. Uh Another thing is remove overused words, like really very like um I am particularly uh guilty of using like way too much um in my uh everyday speech. So if I were going to write something down, I would be very, very careful to edit those things out and next check for things like precision of speech and, and that can be a very fun activity for your students. Um You can say, all right, kind of thinking about that offline example, looking at their print out of their paper, I want you to find three vague adjectives and you can give them examples like bad or happy or, you know, whatever the case may be just something that uh could be more specific. And so instead of saying someone felt bad, you could say someone felt ill, ok? That's definitely a different kind of condition than someone s someone felt anxious or someone felt depressed. So keep in mind that precision of, of speech, you know, that can occur um offline and online and also that uh it can be, you know, a very fun activity for your students. And that's something that can also happen pretty easily in a group setting as well. So you might have a student like read a sentence of theirs doesn't have to be the entire paper because that's stressful. Um But they might read a sentence that they're wanting some ideas for a revision on to their to their group, then someone else could say, oh well, what about this word? And then they could put in the word that they are wanting to replace. So keep in mind, revision can be a really fun um activity both individually and as a group. Now this next portion, this is also again from the engage OK presentation by Jason Stevenson. So this strategy basically is checking for sentence variety. Um And what you would have your students do is circle the first words of sentences to check for sentence variety. So if we look at this paragraph, OK. And all of the beginnings of the sentences, you notice that most of them begin with I or we and it, this is a narrative. So obviously, it's going to be centered around the narrator. Um but it's not a very, it's not a very varied paragraph. All right. So what you might do as a as a revision strategy is kind of work out, how could you rephrase some of these sentences, maybe combine them or maybe or rearrange the structure a little bit just so that it's a little bit more interesting. Um And that, that's obviously something that, you know, once you've uh gotten a little more comfortable with it, you can help your students as they go along. Um So revision strategies, next, we're gonna be moving into editing strategies. All right. Now, remember, revision refers more to the content and editing is referring to the conventions. So we're gonna be looking for errors and this can be for grammar usage, punctuation, capitalization and spelling. And keep in mind it's really important that we uh we don't overwhelm our students or ourselves with trying to attain perfection. OK? Because when you get into the editing stra stage, if you are aiming for perfection, you are going to be working on that piece of writing for the rest of your life and you will never get it because there's always different ways that you could fine tune something. Ok. The point of editing is to make sure that any mistakes you've made don't interfere with your message and that is especially true for spelling. I know a lot of people worry, worry about their students spelling, especially thinking about that state test, the the kind of convention with grading state tests like that is spelling is not going to be deducted unless the person grading cannot figure out what the student is trying to say. So as long as they're close and their meaning is understood, they're not going to have points taken off. Um The same thing can be said for other kinds of mistakes. You know, once again, we're not trying to get perfection, we are trying to make sure that our message is as clear as possible. So as an example, if you have students who do a lot of like really rambling sentences, um one thing that you can, um, train them to do is focusing on sentence construction, you know, um, like focus on the thing that limits their meaning from being clear the most. And for some students that is spelling. So that's where you wanna focus. But others, it might be something like sentence structure or, um just, you know, if they have uh grammar mistakes or maybe they speak from a dialect that's a little different or their ell, um you might focus on grammar usage instead, whatever the case may be, every student is going to be different. Um Now let's talk about some editing strategies. OK. So the next, the thing that you want to talk about and I pasted in the top about um editing, you know, just to reinforce, but model using a checklist, like the one students will use on the OS TP or similar checklists. Um So looking at that, this is the one from the Oklahoma State Department of Education and it's the, it's going to be the same for 5th and 8th grade, but this, this goes over both revision and editing strategies. So, uh it's really important that students are familiar with it. All right. And if they just uh are able to check those things off, as, you know, I've looked at this and I've made sure that it's OK. Um Then they're going to feel a little more confident about their writing. So keep in mind, a checklist can be incredibly helpful. Um next, when you're grading essays focus on narrow specific elements. So once again, like, don't overwhelm your students when you're grading an essay. Um If you notice, you know, as an example, if you say we're gonna focus just on sentences, OK, good sentences, clear subjects and verbs and punctuation. That's what I'm looking for. But if you notice as you're going through that, that there are a lot of grammar mistakes or that there's a lot of spelling mistakes, just kind of keep track of that and focus on it for the next assignment. Um But when, when we're trying to work on elements to improve, if we try to do it all at the same time, it can be overwhelming for students, especially if they are reluctant writers or if they are new to the whole writing process. So make sure that you're using rubrics. Um You can access rubrics from the Oklahoma State Department of Ed website or you can use the one that is generated in no red ink for guided drafts or if you want to, you can create your own. Um Just keep that in mind that you've got a lot of examples that you can follow. Next, we are going to be talking about writing on the OS TP. So basically 5th and 8th grade are the two grades where writing is tested. But, you know, as we've talked about earlier, writing is such a crucial, um you know, kind of world building skill um that you do not want to limit writing instruction to just 5th and 8th grade. You want to use those years prior as building stones to, to get your students ready for those exams. So, you know, keep in mind that's a lot of instructional time uh to capitalize on um something else to keep in mind from what we discussed when we were talking about daily writing. Um writing increases student interaction with text. And so the more writing that you're having your students doing, the more that they're going to interact with text, the better they're going to interact with text and then they are going to be better readers as well. So it's, it's just a big circle and that's why I used the image that I have on this slide. Um So make sure that you are giving your students ample time to practice for the writing that they're going to be expected to know how to do when they're 5th and 8th graders. Um Next writing on the O OS TP, there's just two slides for this section. You've got examples which we've referenced before. Um They have examples of 5th and 8th grade writing. They also include rubrics and the checklist. So those are all really uh helpful resources to have um with the exemplars that means that you have an example of writing, you know, um for those of us who are not coming from an el a background or if we're teaching out of a grade band. Then, then we're familiar with having an example of what student writing looks like is essential. The rubrics are also really helpful. But keep in mind that when we're teaching writing, we're gonna focus on maybe just one part of the rubric instead of the entire rubric. And then of course, the checklist is really helpful for your students as well. Um No red ink also has guided drafts that are built around the resources provided by the the state. And that also gives your students the scaffolding that they have from practicing in no red ink with writing, but they have those, those examples, they have those resources, they have the rubric and the checklist. So it's like a combination of two really fantastic resources and also keep in mind um the eighth grade writing practice um that they have provided from the state that's not exclusively for eighth graders. So if I've got 1/6 grader, it's totally ok to have them practicing with the eighth grades, uh prompt. Um you know, it might, you know, it might prove challenging for them, but just remind them that this is practice and they're getting familiar with the kind of writing that they're gonna have to do as an eighth grader. You know, it's, it's really simple to explain, you know, I'm not grading you as if you were an eighth grader. I'm grading you as though you're 1/6 grader, but you're getting exposed to the type of writing, the structure, the form and all of those things are really important to understand as you prepare for that eighth grade test. Next writing on the sentence level. So these next three sections, we're going to be breaking down uh what writing can look like on those various levels and some strategies for teaching them. Um And then we will, you know, kind of build as we go. So we start with sentences, move into paragraphs and finally long form writing. So writing on the sentence level. OK? Um I hear this a lot. We live in a very different age now. Um Our sentence or excuse me, our students are not uh interacting with sentence construction the same way that we did. Um because a lot of their communication and their, their understanding of the world happens through cell phones, um You know, that's just the way of it. So breaking that habit of, you know, text speak, um it can be pretty tricky, but the good thing about it is there's a really easy solution. Um Well, I say easy, I should say simple. Um because it's not exactly easy. The thing is if you have your students practicing writing sentences on a daily basis, it becomes habit and once it becomes habit, it becomes a lot easier to build on that. So this might be the takeaway for a lot of you. Um You know, I, I mentioned one takeaway if you can take one thing away from this presentation, it's writing on the sentence level. Have your students practice writing sentences every single day and it can be a quick writing neritic. It can be answering questions in their core curriculum with complete sentences. It could even be sending you a daily email where they have to write incomplete sentences, whatever the case may be, build that habit, that's essential. Um Otherwise students are not gonna have a good starting point. So um one easy way to start with sentences is sentence builders. And I included a couple of examples or a few examples from the letters manual. So a really basic 12 part sentence builder chart who or what, which represents our subject and then the action. OK. Um If you're really starting from scratch with a student, a two part sentence builder really helps them understand the needs of a sentence that you need a subject and you need a verb. And from there, you can build out more complicated sentences but subject and verb, those are the building blocks. OK? Uh Next you move into the three part sentence builder chart. So you have the who or what and the action and then you have more detail. OK? So you're starting from those very essential building blocks and adding more information. And then we move into the extended sentence builder chart where you're starting to add really cool things like adjectives, more nouns and verbs object, nouns, prepositional phrases, and then it just keeps going on from there. So we start at the very beginning with subjects and verbs and as you build through the the charts with your students, then they're going to be able to put together much more interesting and complicated sentences. Now also keep in mind this is not a a vendor training, but I do talk about no red ink quite a bit because it is a writing supplemental. Um quick writes in no red ink offer sentence, writing exercises to build student skills. So if you've got reluctant writers or kids that, that it just seems like they can't write a sentence to save their life. The quick rights are a good way to start with that. And also keep in mind uh when you make an assignment like that, model it with them. Ok? Um If they've never written before or they've missed a lot of school or they weren't engaged with school for the last couple of years because all kinds of things have been interrupting that they need more modeling. Ok? Um And I know that that's hard to, to dedicate the time to that, but showing them what you expect when they're writing um is really crucial. Um The modeling aspect of writing instruction just ensures that they have an idea in their head of what they're supposed to be working on. Um It can be really hard to put that into a, a concrete concept for a student if they don't have one provided. So just keep that in mind having an example or working through it with them just helps ensure success. So next, we're gonna look at building on the paragraph level. All right. Now, here is a place where visuals are a great way to teach the structure of a paragraph. Um I remember um because when I started working on this presentation, it was just around Thanksgiving. Um I actually remember that one of my grade school teachers had a, a turkey paragraph, like little poster in her room. Um And so, like, you know, anyway, you could probably envision what that looked like, but it was fun and it was, and it was interesting, but I couldn't find a, a representation online. So I found a few other examples. So the, the paragraph um rendered as the hand is a really great one because barring really kind of out there um situations your students are gonna have a hand with them when they go into the testing room. OK. So they could look at their hand and visualize what they have done before with writing. Um So they would know, you know, like the palm of my hand is my main idea. My thumb is my topic, sentence and so on and so forth. That's a really great visual to teach them that will, they can carry with them wherever they go. Um Another thing kind of bringing in that visual element of working offline with an essay is using highlighting colors as they're working through a paragraph. Like, can you highlight your topic sentence? OK. Can you highlight your conclusion? And those can be the same color because those are connected when you have your topic sentence, usually you reiterate it in your conclusion. Um Then your supporting ideas are a different color and your detail sentences are a different color. And when you've got all three of your colors represented, you know that you've covered your bases. Um And then this was another example that I found online of the Oreo paragraph, which what a great visual and also you could bring cookies to your meeting with them and they would probably love you for it. Um But it goes through the process like what do each of these layers, you know, mean when we're constructing a paragraph, this would be really great um for constructed response practice as well because you can see like reason for my opinion, you could easily replace that with text evidence. So just an idea to consider next uh just to continue on um paragraph frames. All right. So a paragraph frame is basically where you're starting off with the the purpose and the mode of the paragraph is already understood and your students are just filling those things in. So basically why paragraph frames are helpful is that they limit um how much your students have to write. So if they're, if your students find it difficult to start. Paragraph frames are a good place to do that. Um They reinforce the structure that's needed and they provide the starts of the ideas. So every sentence has it started already and your students are just filling in what they found or what they know and they provide structure for those students who aren't ready to write full paragraphs all by themselves. So um I also linked in some re uh a link for paragraph frames. So you have some ideas on how to go from there. All right. So moving into the home stretch, long form, writing. All right. Now, if you're like a traditional person, um and not like me who loved writing essays. Uh When you think about essays, it, it's probably with a sense of trepidation or even uh like just revulsion maybe. Um But essays do not have to be painful. OK? One important thing to keep in mind is breaking them up into smaller pieces for your students. So as an example with guided drafts with no red ink, anytime you make an assignment, no red ink, it's gonna give you like a time allotment. You know, it'll say this could take your student anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for a practice assignment, um 10 to 20 minutes on longer assignments. Um but guided drops, it'll say like 90 to 100 and 80 minutes. OK? And when, when people see that they're like Oh, that's a lot of time. It does not have to be like that. Ok? If you think about it 100 and 80 minutes broken up over the course of, of five or six days relates uh to a much shorter amount of time for your students. So keep that in mind that you do not have to uh you know, do a whole essay all in one sitting. Now, obviously with the state test, you do and you wanna try to build in some stamina as your students are going along. But when they're just getting started, it's OK to say we're just gonna work on this for 20 minutes. Um, you know, start small and build from there. It's kind of like running, ok? If a person wants to be a runner, they don't just wake up one day and decide to run a marathon, they'll start by going for a jog through their neighborhood and then they'll build up to a five K and then they'll build up further than that. They don't, um, they don't just wake up one day and, you know, decide I'm gonna write or I'm gonna run for 26 miles and you don't just wake up one day deciding, oh, I'm just gonna write an essay like today, you start small. OK. So it's OK to just have a, an example where you're gonna write like an introductory paragraph with your students or we're gonna write a body paragraph and just work on the structure of that paragraph. You don't have to throw them into the deep end of the pool. Ok. But going back to long form, writing in general beyond the essay. All right, you wanna give your students uh opportunities to write in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes. So, you know, going back to sort of the expectations of eighth grade writing test, they could be tested on three different uh you know, forms. Basically, they could be tested to write a narrative essay, an argumentative essay or an informational essay. Most students are going to feel a little more excited about one form than the other. Um Some kids really love narrative writing, others uh get very like competitive and they really love argumentative writing. Um I can say from personal experience, I did great with argumentative writing. I was a competitive debater in high school. But then other people, they just wanna like, tell you about things that they've learned. And so they really love informational writing. Um The thing is you want to expose your students to a lot of different types of writing um And a lot of different writing exercises so that they can figure out what kind of writer am I? OK. So case in point and I talk about competitive speech a lot because I competed in it in high school and then I coached it for a few years. So I have a lot of examples. There was a student that I judged at competitions, his parents own a petting zoo. And so all of his speeches, regardless of what they were about related to his experience, helping to manage his parents petting zoo. And it was really fun because it gave him a chance to talk about something that he loved. And that is a very important perspective to bring to writing instruction. You're giving your students a chance to talk about things that they enjoy talking about. And you know, you guys know some to generate that spark, they will tell you everything about their day. You sit down to have a meeting with them and you say, well, how are you doing today? And then like 30 minutes later you're OK, you're like, OK, OK, we really have to get on track. Ok. Come on, you know, because they just love talking so much. But then there are those students who are shy or maybe in their life, they don't feel like people have wanted to hear what they have to say. You have to work really hard to reach those students, but it is very valuable to reach them. So, um we talked about the second part when preparing for the state test. Think back to the standards and those three main uh ways of writing, um graphic organizers. We've talked about graphic organizers with Prew writing and also bringing that into the drafting process. Keep in mind once again. This applies especially to long form writing. Um graphic organizers help you stay on track when you are, you know, putting those thoughts down on paper, um providing a mentor text once again is super important to show them what the assignment can look like. And then scaffold as students move through their essays and that can happen in person. But remember that no red ink also offers scaffolding as they work through guided drafts And then finally, um practice using the writers checklist with your students. So once that draft is over, use the checklist with them and say, ok, did you check for this, you know, and, and have them look for those things and, and point to them on the essay, like if it mentions thesis statement, it's like, ok, where is your thesis statement? And if they can't find it, that's time to revise, we need to make sure we have one in there. All right. So we are just about out of time. So I wanted to talk one really quickly about some supports that you can have um with writing instruction. Obviously, the instructional coaches are here to help me, especially with secondary elai. I love to talk about writing. Um But we are also working on PD in January and we have in the past few months as well worked on cross curricular um writing and that's a great way to multiply your time. Um in January specifically, um Tara who does science instructional coaching, and Katie who does social studies instructional coaching and myself, we are going to present on uh practiced and constructed responses across the subject areas. So keep in mind that there's a lot of writing PD coming in January, we can also help with resource location teaching strategies and how you can use your data to guide instruction. So um you can also contact us through fresh service and I also linked in my office hours there. Now, online resources, OK? Um Online resources make it a lot easier to make assignments for your students. So you don't have to try to re invent the wheel every time. Um And they ensure that your students are gonna be comfortable with writing online, which is the format that they will be tested on and it lets your students work asynchronously. And two really great supplements for writing are near pod and no red ink. You can uh you can put writing um you know, prompts into your near pod lessons and have students contribute to that. Um both synchronously and asynchronously and then no red ink of course, is a great writing supplement. Now, another thing to keep in mind, I've talked quite a bit about the importance of offline. Writing offline resources are incredibly important in helping your students build that kinesthetic bond, think of a, think of a rope or a line connecting your brain to your hands. OK? When you work offline, it seems like that kinesthetic bond can be built a lot faster and a lot stronger. So, a composition notebook for your students, highlighters, um white boards, whatever the case may be. Um It's good to have offline resources for writing in math too. If you think about it, that's pretty important too. But that's a different subject area that I'm not even going to touch. All right. Next, additional resources. So I included uh a few resources um from no red ink, the graphic organizers uh spreadsheet is also included and uh how to incorporate writing into your daily routine. And finally, um before we finish up, um if you could click on the survey link or use the QR code um to finish up our survey. This presentation was the wonderful world of writing and I am Lindsay Headley. So when you fill out that survey, I would really appreciate it and that is about it. We have a little bit of time um If anyone has any questions. But otherwise, um you know, I, I wish you a wonderful Friday and I hope to work with you in the future. All righty. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and stop the recording.\"), (2061, 626, 3881, \"Joining. All righty. So first off, um you know, as people are getting set up and into the meeting and everything, um there is the QR code reader for Google Chrome extension which allows QR codes to be accessed or accessed from your computer. Um So if you, you know, don't typically sign into your epic email on your phone, uh you have the ability to access the survey from the QR code on your computer as well. And we will also drop the survey link into the chat when the presentation is concluded and we are working today on the presentation building a daily writing habit. I know that that can be a really difficult um habit to establish for our, our students, especially if they're coming from a, a standpoint where they have not been doing a lot of writing. Um It's, it's very similar to any kind of other endurance activity like running a marathon or, you know, taking long road trips or whatever the case may be learning how to paint. You know, you can't go from not doing the activity to all of a sudden being able to, you know, just produce a, a ton of different product in regards to writing or any other kind of creative effort. So we're going to talk about meeting kids where they are and building those habits into bigger and better habits as they go along. So, um remember also that this is a focus on grades five through eight. Some of these activities can definitely be scaled down for younger students and they can be scaled up for older students as well. So it there is that um kind of limiter of grades five through eight, that's where I'm particularly focused on at this point. But remember that you can apply it to students wherever they are at. So first off, we're going to start with some icann statements. Now, these are goals uh that I have set for us as a group. Um By the end of the training, we should all be able to utilize the tools that we're going to discuss in this hour so that we can get students writing at their current level. Um And you should be able to uh by the end of the hour, put resources that I've gathered together um to use in building a daily writing habit for your students, whether your students are writing at the sentence level, whether they are ready for paragraphs or whether they're ready to go on from there. And of course, the most important one that we will be able to support our students as they advance into higher writing skills So our next uh next activity is the jam board. What is writing? So if you can uh go ahead and click that link, if you have the presentation up and I will drop the link directly into the chat, just go ahead and drop a sticky so that you can see or so you can say what is writing exactly. All right, what is it to you? And we will take a couple of minutes to see those responses and talk about them a little bit. And it's OK to say, I, you know, have a very traditional standpoint of what writing is. Uh You could also say that, you know, you could talk about it in a philosophical sense as well. So it doesn't show any options for stickies or anything like yours does weird. Let me see if I can change this. Oh, it says view only. That's what it is. That's what it is. Thank you for speaking up. All righty. If you would press refresh, you will now have the option to comment. I have the link again too when I came in. I think it had already been sent. Absolutely. So for those of us who are coming in a little bit later, we're talking about what writing is, what it can be for our students, how our students can uh can be writers, you know, um does writing simply mean that you've reached sort of the end goal of publishing a book, does it mean that you write on the daily? Does it mean that you are a capable communicator? I'm seeing some really wonderful um expression. That's a very big one, explaining your brain, putting thoughts on paper. OK. This is wonderful. I'm loving what you guys are seeing or saying and this is all very true. All right. So when we talk about writing, sometimes we have a very formal concept in our mind of what writing is, um that it has to be sort of like, it must be essays or it must be, you know, like publishing a book or publishing an academic paper. And those are certainly long term goals for a lot of people, especially if they um move into, you know, college education where they want to focus on getting published, uh, you know, as an academic writer, but it can be something as, as personal as keeping a daily journal. Um I'm a daily journal person. I have been keeping a journal since I was in middle school. And for me, it's a very therapeutic process. And in all honesty, I wouldn't have found that pathway as a person, if not for having good writing skills to begin with. So I really have to be thankful for my, my teachers in upper elementary and middle school for instilling those habits in me so that I could then transfer, transfer it into personal expression. And the same thing is true for a lot of students who are looking for a creative outlet. Um Creative writing is a wonderful uh pathway for expression for our students. So the thing is writing can be a lot of different things and that's not even touching on things like college and career readiness where you think about all the different forms of communication that technically are writing, think about filling out an application, writing an email to a professor. Um you know, being able to prepare some good interview answers when you know that you're going to be interviewed for like a President's leadership class or something like that. Um All of those things are writing, even if they don't necessarily take the form of, you know, typing or putting pen to paper. Um Another element is, you know, public speaking, um being able to discuss things in a well thought out manner in class, you know, all of those, those activities rely on writing skills, even if we don't necessarily say this is a writing skill. So I think you guys are in a really great place to understand what we're gonna be talking about here, sort of what the long term goal is with encouraging writing for our students and just realizing that the activities we talk about today, they are starting points, but there's really no end for how far your students can go with writing. So we're gonna head back to the presentation at this point and we're gonna talk a little bit about our agenda for the day. So we're gonna talk about the importance of daily writing. And I think, I think everyone's on the same page with that, which is awesome to see. Then we're gonna talk about um techniques we can use to build uh skills where our, our students are struggling with sentences. Uh Then we'll move into paragraphs, graphic organizers, constructed responses and quick rights. So you can kind of see that it starts at that very basic level of sentences and it builds from there. So next is the importance of writing. So like a lot of you, I am in, I'm working through letters training at the moment. And um the thing about it is uh the importance of writing is that, you know, every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities and sometimes that gets neglected um because we focus on other things or because um there might be other difficulties that our students are encountering. There can be a lot of barriers to instilling those writing habits in those very early years. But writing activities improve students, grammar and reading skills and vice versa. Writing gives your students also the power of expression and this is vital to their sense of self and future development. So really quickly, I'm gonna, I'm gonna launch a poll um for all of you uh just asking basically how often and this, if you're not a teacher, no problem. Um That's not a worry but just how often are your students writing on a regular basis? Let's see. Where are my poles? Mm. That's interesting because I set them up. Alrighty, maybe I need to stop chair for a second. I will stop here for a second and see if that allows me to set. There's my pole. All right. So the question is how often do your students write? And it, you know, there's no shame if it's rarely, there's no shame if it is on a monthly basis. Obviously, we wanna try to get it going where it is a daily kind of activity for our students. Um But this is an honest and open communication at this point. So think about where your students are at right now. All righty and I'll give it another few seconds and then we'll end the poll and show results. OK? So as you guys can see from that, um a lot of our students are writing on a weekly basis, which is great. That's a wonderful place to start. Um And you might be envisioning like when I say, how often are your students writing? You might be actually thinking more of like extended writing as opposed to, you know, smaller pieces of writing. So keep in mind also that the, you know, the all kinds of writing count in terms of this uh question. All righty. So with that being said, I'm gonna share screen once again and head back to my presentation. Now, the next thing we're gonna talk about is sentence building. All right. And just to give you an overview of what we're going to be looking at specifically with sent sentence building. We're gonna talk about sentence frames, sentence starters and checking for complete sentences. So keep in mind uh if your student has like a critical misunderstanding of the parts of a sentence, then that means you probably need to walk it back and give them some grammar remediation. So like take it back to that concept of like parts of speech and show them how the pieces of sentences can fit together to make independent clauses and dependent clauses. Um However, with that being said, um we're just focusing on the actual crafting of sentences. So bear in mind, you can like I said, scale it back or up as you need to for your students. So starting with sentence frames. OK. So you might be asking what is a sentence frame and it's a preconstructed frame that allows your student to fill in the gaps. So this would be useful for students who are really just getting started. Um This is very guided writing. Um It also allows your students to help build their response faster. So if you have a student who really is struggling or they feel like they're taking too long, sometimes providing them with a sentence frame to help them formulate, the answer can be really, really helpful. And another place where you can instill that practice very quickly. So imagine that you are meeting one on one with that student and you show them how to use a sentence frame, then they might be able to use that sentence frame as they are completing open ended questions in a core curriculum. So as an example, if you give them like if it's a question that says, what is your opinion about blank? You could use a sentence frame that shows them to say, I think that this is and then they put their opinion right in there. So instead of students having that instinct to just say, you know, like, oh, I guess the book was terrible. You know, they're formulating in it into a more complete thought um that reflects the language of the question. So that's a really great way that you can show them the technique and then apply it into the work that they're already doing. So you're not creating more work for them, you're just showing them how they can be more effective in building up some writing practice in their core. So next, we're gonna look at a few examples of um sentence frames and these are actually kind of cross curricular to be honest, there's a few question or a few frames that refer to um math concepts and science. And I also included the source for those examples. So you can, you know, dive in and apply those as, as you would like. So here are some examples and you can see that these really start very low level. OK. So very easily scaled down to kindergarten, first grade level and very easy to, to adjust if you have a student who is, you know, in middle school, but performing lower and you can see that it can be um you know, pretty extensive and you're bringing in some of that academic vocabulary where it says like based on the experiment, I can infer that the blank will increase and the blank will decrease. Um you can restructure that and adjust it. And the nice thing about it is inference is found in social studies and el A. So teaching your student a sentence frame that talks about inference, they could imply they could apply that to multiple subject areas. And obviously, every situation is going to be a little bit different. Um you know, a sentence frame that works for 1/4 grader may not necessarily be the right sentence frame for an eighth grader. Um But just showing them that structure can get them built building the habit of answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions. The next thing is sentence starters. And so this is a little bit different from uh a sentence frame rather than them uh or rather than the students like filling in the gaps, the sentence starters will start the sentence, but then the students have to fill in all of the rest of the information. So really, this is ideal for all students. Um but if you have students really operating at that very, very low level, uh they might need a little bit more progression. So, um think about, uh you know, think about your students who continually tell you things like, I don't know how to start. I'm not sure how to, to get this going or I'm not sure what to say at this point. Um You know, sentence uh starters can be a really, really good uh choice for them. Um text evidence, which I've got linked in here is a great place for us to start with sentence starters because that comes up so often not only in the standards and in the state tests, but really uh you know, think about all of the times in core where we see questions where it's like use text evidence and then think about in high school and college when you have to provide evidence of where you got your answer. So text evidence, the sooner you start that the more beneficial it's going to be for your students. So I've linked in my text evidence, sentence starters sheet. This is a really simple document um that just provides a lot of different examples of how you can start off a sentence that you need to provide some text evidence for. So one thing that could be really helpful for your students is sending this to them and having them printed off or if you've got a printer, printing it for them, but whatever the case may be so that they've got it kind of handy and they can refer to it whenever they're going to be writing. Now, keep in mind also, this can be helpful in core curriculum when they're answering open ended text evidence questions. It's really great when they're doing test prep because there's going to be those text evidence type and uh questions on the state test. And also when you get ready to start teaching like informational writing or argumentative writing, this can be implemented in the essays as well. So this is helpful on a lot of different levels. And as you can see, there are quite a few of them uh to choose from. So, you know, you can let your students kind of play around with that and try different techniques until they find one that really feels comfortable for them. Alrighty. And our last sentence building technique is checking for complete sentences. Now, this one is probably the most sophisticated I would say because they actually need to be, you know, kind of taking it to that next level of, of understanding of knowledge. Um So you can use a sample um you know, whether it's off of no red ink as an example or the State department's writing section or their own work, you can practice with your students checking for complete sentences. So really if you break it down to its simplest level. Uh a complete sentence needs three things. You have to have that capital letter at the beginning. You have to have in punctuation and you have to have at least one independent clause with a subject and a verb. And obviously sentences can get more sophisticated as they go on. But those are the basics. So, and remember we're, we're starting where kids are OK. Um And keep in mind also that if your students have that, that basic misunderstanding of the grammar itself, you can take that back into practice, um maybe give them some of the basics once again. Um Just to make sure that those, those concepts are cemented in their mind before you are having them check their own work. Now, one other thing is checking for complete sentences is a part of the writers checklist. Um So if you've got fifth or eighth graders, when they head into the um the test, you know, the state test at the end of the year, they will be given a copy of the writer's checklist. And if you practice using that writer's checklist with your students throughout the year, they're gonna feel more comfortable using it by themselves when they're taking the test. So just keep that in mind that that is a pretty handy test, taking tip as you are prepping for that season of life. So next thing is I'm gonna turn on my, actually turn on one of my poles. Um And it's the after sentence section question. Which technique do you think? Um there it's been shared? OK. Which technique do you think, did that pop up for you guys? Because it's saying that it has been shared? Yeah, it is. OK. Good. All right. Which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? And then go ahead and let's see. Is it gonna let me launch it? Hm. It's just showing on your shared screen? Yeah, I think it's stop sharing. Ah OK. Thank you very much. Now, it's still uh not letting me launch it. OK. So in the chat, uh just tell me which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? Whether it's sentence frames, checking for complete sentences or sentence starters? I'm liking all the people saying all of them. That's really awesome. Sentence starters are another really great one that's just pretty much grab and go, you know, because it's very easy to implement in a very short demonstration with your students. Practice it a few times and then they're able to start taking it, you know, into what they're working on. OK. Well, I'm going to go ahead and share screen once more and head back to the presentation and we're heading into paragraphs at this point. So quick overview of what we're gonna talk about with paragraphs, paragraph frames similar to sentence frames and we're gonna move it a little bit deeper into our understanding of using text evidence with the race strategy. So moving into paragraph frames, um these are students who have mastered complete sentences and they're ready for building paragraphs. Um And in a lot of ways, uh building paragraphs is honestly easier. Once, you know, students, it seems like some students struggle with the basic building blocks of sentences, but building paragraphs can be simpler for them. I, I'm not sure what the, what the psychology is of that. But uh it's just anecdotally from my uh my use of paragraphs with students, it seems like once they've grasped sentences, paragraphs as a building block bigger than sentences is just really simple to grasp. So they're very helpful when you're teaching different types of paragraphs. Um So if you're teaching the structure of different kinds of paragraphs, like narrative, uh description, compare and contrast using a paragraph frame can help them understand like what are you envisioning? And I, I think with writing especially because it is so creative and it is so grounded in expression. Sometimes having a visual of what it can look like shows students what they're capable of. And just fy i another kind of test taking tip just because that's on all of our minds. Um The Oklahoma State Department of Ed website, they have a whole writing section that has student examples. So you can see good student examples, poor student examples. I think these are really helpful to show students because it shows them this is what a person your age most likely can produce. Um Some kids really get anxiety about those things because uh they feel almost like imposter syndrome, you know, like, oh I'm not a good writer, you know, and they can see you're probably a better writer than you think you are. But going back to paragraph frames, um the race paragraph frame that we're gonna talk about next perfect for text evidence. But other types of paragraph frames like I've talked about before, narrative, informational, descriptive and so on. And I included a link to a scholastic uh assignment um that really builds out a lot of really cool paragraph frames. Um So keep in mind also that showing your students how to use paragraph frames once again, can be really helpful for those state test. Uh open ended questions and again, you're not creating more work for them. You're just instilling the expectation that they will answer, you know, open ended questions with complete sentences and paragraphs when the situation calls for it. So as an example, if you get a question in bright thinker that says, what were the three causes for the election of Teddy Roosevelt, you know, in or a social studies class, then your student would obviously need to organize a paragraph that incorporates those three reasons. So, you know, just kind of building that expectation doesn't create more work um for either you or the student, it just increases the expectation. So if you have students who kind of struggle with writing because they feel like it's more work, these techniques that we're talking about can really help alleviate that because it, it becomes a habit. You know, you do it instinctively as an example. Yesterday, I was uh talking with my no red ink, uh support people and one is older than me and the other one is younger than me. And I, I joked with them and I said, hey, have you guys adjusted to saying 2023 in your writing yet? And the, the younger person said I still am writing 2022. But my handwriting is so terrible that it doesn't matter. And I said, you know, as an elder millennial, I think I might be the last person that was taught to write everything in cursive and very neatly after that, I feel like all, all the teachers at my school just were like, ah, forget about it. Um, so with that being said, you know, um, for me at that being of that age, um, cursive writing is just a habit. I don't even have to think about it. But even somebody who's like, five years younger than me cursive can be something that they have to think about because they didn't practice it so much. And writing is exactly the same way. Um, for all of us who, you know, we've worked through Bachelor's degrees. Most of us have worked through master's degrees. Some of you rock stars out there are working on phd s like it doesn't take any effort to be able to produce a lot of writing and very quickly and very professionally, but you have to scale back your expectation. You know, think about your students and think about where they are and even maybe picture yourself when you were that age and what you were capable of doing. So just bear in mind. Uh you know, once you start building those habits, it really takes off, but sometimes building the habit in the first place can be the hard part. So next, we're gonna talk about the race strategy. So race just stands for restate the question answer the question, cite text evidence and explain. OK. So it's super, super applicable for a lot of different types of open ended questions where you're having to explain your answer c text evidence. If it has any of that kind of lingo in the question, your students can use this strategy. And once again building that habit, once you've done it for a few days or weeks, it just becomes instinctive to use the lingo that you've created with your text evidence, starters and to follow this strategy, I also linked in here, uh a link for further reading. So keep in mind that you've, you've got that available to you. Um And we're gonna just go through the steps of the strategy. So restating the question, this is one that you know, it relates. So um so well to student success, when they need to write a complete sentence, if you just restate the question and use the language of the question in your answer, uh Half the battle of writing a complete sentence is over, you know, um it's all there in the question. So you remove the question word from the question and write it as a statement. So this itself restating the question as a sentence that could be an activity that you practice with your students. So an example would be who was responsible for the broken vase. Like they're reading a story about, you know, some kids who broke a vase. Um You could reply in your answer, Jennifer was responsible for the broken vase. So you've taken out the question word of who and you've put your answer in there and you've got a sentence, it's that easy, then you're going to answer the question. So you restate and answer the question that can happen in the same sentence. But it's crucial to make sure that the entire question is answered. So the technique that you can take into this with your students is have them like underline or point to or circle or highlight whatever you want the words in the sentence that are, you know, basically showing them what's being asked. And if you think about it, that's an important technique that translates across curricular or cross subject areas. You know, think about reading a word problem in math and how you have to break down what's actually being asked of you in that word problem so that you don't accidentally do it opposite of how you're supposed to for the word problem. The same thing is true in el A or an opened in science question or social studies, make sure that the entire question is answered. And once again, it's a habit so that students, you know, slow down and read thoroughly. Next is citing text evidence. We talked about this previously with sentence starters. So again, we're building on what we've done in the previous section and bringing it into a paragraph and to go along with that for the explained portion where they explain how their text evidence supports their answer. Um I have a document for explanation, sentence starters to help them. And so, you know, if you think about writing as being a progression, you know, when you pick up habits and tools at the sentence level, it doesn't mean that you abandon them when you get to the paragraph level. Here's two places where you're actually using those uh those sentence starters to help you write a really great paragraph. And also keep in mind when you're talking to your students about the expectation of writing with complete sentences and creating paragraphs to open ended questions. You can do that with science, you can do it with social studies, you can do it with El A and just every time they're doing that they are writing and they are adding to their habit of writing. So then when you know, they move up to the next grade or when they have to answer a constructive response on the state test or they have to write essays or whatever the case may be, they're going to be ready for it. So these are pretty powerful tools that your students can apply towards their own learning and understanding. So our next section is graphic organizers. All righty. Now, graphic organizers are one of my favorite things about El A. Um Once again, can be applied to a lot of different situations in El A and it can go cross curricular with science and social studies as well. So bear in mind that these kinds of graphic organizers we're looking at, you might be showing them to your students in a lot of different areas. Um Keep in mind also. And I think I talk about this a little bit later in the slides too, but I wanted to reiterate it now when your students go into the testing room. All right. All of the, the comforts of home are stripped away. They are in an unfamiliar place. They're sitting in a group of students that they don't know, probably um they might have AAA test administrator that they don't know. And so test anxiety is a real thing. And it can be, uh, kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know, and it's hard, it's hard to remember what it's like when you're a little kid, um, when you've, you know, gone decades and years way beyond that. But if you teach your students how to use things, like taking notes, graphic organizers using scratch paper when they're, you know, working online, they can take those habits into the testing room with them. All right. And so this example that I'm gonna show you um on the next slide is one of those really good graphic organizers that if you practice that with your students, they can have that visual picture in their mind as they're going into the test room. So when they encounter, you know, a question about like what's the main idea of this passage? They could jot that graphic organizer down and fill it in with the passage that they just read and they're gonna feel successful, you know, they're gonna feel capable and they're gonna know that they can answer those questions with, you know, 100% correctness because they've got that visual in front of them to help them. So remember, graphic organizers really helpful to help your students recall what they do know. Um So just to talk about graphic organizers in general, they help us track info. And for you as the teacher, they can also help see where your students have gaps in their information. So for instance, if your student is filling out this main ide graphic organizer and they, they know the main idea right there, like they read the passage and they were like, this is the main idea and you're thinking, oh, but what if you have to provide text evidence and a question about that, you know, where are you going to be able to show me that that is in the passage? That's when you can say, let's take this a step back and actually look for the supporting details because you're right, you found the main idea, but I need to see more. I need to know more about what you're doing. Um So graphic organizers can be really helpful in that regard for the teacher as well. They make a nice visual representation for written responses. Um I love outlines. I find them to be very, very helpful. Um not only as a writer myself but also for students because it shows them sort of almost like a checklist, you know, like first in my introduction, I'm going to write about this and then, oh yeah, I forgot I need to put in my thesis statement and I need to make sure that I've done a hook of some sort to pull my reader in. Um you know, then it makes body paragraphs very, very quick and easy to put together. So outlines and graphic organizers kind of go hand in hand in being super helpful for getting our writing organized. Now, in contrast to sentence and paragraph frames. Um graphic organizers allow for a lot more fluidity. You know, it's more about the planning and the creativity rather than having um sort of the answer built, you know what I'm saying? Um At this point with a graphic organizer, like there's still that scaffolding that's happening with the graphic organizer. But it is also allowing us to, you know, give more freedom to our students, which I did notice on our jam board, some people wrote freedom of expression. You know, when we're talking about a sentence frame, there's very little uh freedom of expression. Then when you move into graphic organizers, like a brainstorm as an example, that's when you really get to see students, let it go and, and have a lot of fun with the creativity that they're having. And remember once again, reiterating that the more we practice using graphic organizers, the better our students will remember them and be able to use them when they go into the testing room. So I was going to uh like actually go through a sample text and provide a sa uh a sample question where we could break down this graphic organizer. But I think in the name of, of time and respecting the time that we have left, um you know, I will kind of give you the gist of the text and then the sample question will make more sense. Um Basically, the sample text uh is about, you know, light disruption. When people have a lot of lights on, on the coastline in Florida, it can cause sea turtle hatchlings to get kind of disoriented. Instead of going towards the sea, they turn and go inland. So basically, they're trying to uh you know, during the the hatching season, they're trying to get people to turn their lights off a little bit more during those hours when they know the turtles are going to be hatching. So kind of cool. Anyway, um moving on into constructive responses, which we've been talking about quite a bit um with open ended questioning, but we're gonna go more in depth with that here. So basically, a constructed response is any kind of open ended question um that goes beyond the yes or no. And they're wanting you to build a response usually centered around text evidence. Um Now, keep in mind uh that's where you're incorporating things like sentence starters and paragraph frames. Um You have a combination of both of those techniques when you're putting together a constructed response and you also have that prompt. Um Think back to when we were talking about using the language of the question in your answer. I if you do that, usually the people who score constructed responses, uh you know, they kind of have a, a rubric or, or some metrics that they're hoping writers are hitting. And so using the language of the question, you're incorporating the vocab that they're looking for. So for instance, if the question says infer and your student also puts infer into their sentence, then, you know, that kind of is like a point in their favor automatically because they're using that lingo um getting students used to making constructive responses helps in a lot of different ways. Um First off, you can build really big paragraphs um just by following like the basic steps of constructive responses. So the example that I previously gave was something like, you know, name three reasons. So that constructed response, it already has three reasons built in. So each one of those reasons is gonna get its own sentence. All right, then you have sort of an opening statement uh where you reflect the language of the question, you have your three reasons and then you have your concluding sentence that explains your answer. So right there, right off the bat, you have a five sentence paragraph. So your student who maybe a few weeks ago was like, I don't know how to write paragraphs or I don't know how to write sentences or they don't even tell you that they don't know how to write those things. They just answer ID K, you know, you can leave them in a very short amount of time from being not a writer to being able to write a paragraph and a pretty big paragraph to boot inferences also become a lot easier. Um especially when students get into the habit of using the language of the question in their answer. Um They're kind of picking up on the hint that is being provided to them in the question. So I think that that's one of the things kids struggle a lot with. When they read a question, they don't really slow down and think. All right, when they're asking me to infer, they're basically saying, make an educated guess. Um And then I have to provide it where I got that, you know, inspiration for that educated guess. All right, so you kind of do that breakdown, like when you're building the question into an answer, you're thinking about what they're really asking of us. So it kind of takes it from just sort of superficially reading the question and makes it more of an in depth active reading activity, but all in a very short amount of time as well. Um And like I say, at the end that then allows it to be in easier to introduce greater depth of knowledge because they're going through those mental steps of reading the question, transferring it into the beginning of their answer and then going into the text to find their answer and then explaining how it supports their inference or their answer, whatever the case may be. So as they go through that process of writing, their reading techniques become better, so pretty powerful stuff. Um a few weeks, well, actually, I think it was longer ago Lauren asked me to provide some research that was about writing and its impact on reading. And I had a, I had always known this as a reader and a writer and as a teacher of those things, but like, actually reading the evidence that supports that they're so symbiotic if you want to be a better reader, be a better writer. And if you wanna write, you need to read, I mean, they, they are so tied together, you know, it's amazing. I it was actually a really fun. Uh couple of hours of research, I really enjoyed it. But anyway, with that being said, now we're gonna move into using an actual supplemental um where you can add some activities to your students uh workload, but in a very, very um easy to handle manner. OK. So the next thing we're gonna talk about is quick rights with no red ink. All right. So first off, these are students or these are ideal for students at any level of mastery. Um No, writing has a lot of different quick rights that are related to skills. So if you've got those students who are needing that practice, like at the grammatical level of sentence construction, uh you've got some quick rights that you can give them if you've got students who have more of a creative writing bend. Um They have quick rights for that if you want to tie it to text evidence, um they have literary analysis quick rights. And if you've got students who are just kind of reluctant, like they just are struggling. Um One thing that I think would be fantastic to do with a student is to actually go into the quick rights, which are linked right here and show them some of the options and then ask them to choose which ones they would like to write about. You know, it's all about expression. So let them have, you know, the, the the agency to pick their own. So they have featured. And when you click into that, you can see a lot of different options over here on the side. If you've got students who are maybe pretty low level uh readers or they're really struggling with, you know, the whole writing thing to begin with. Try some of these like for fun, um different kinds of prompts, like picture prompts. I was talking with the narrating people yesterday and I said, you know, I feel like the picture prompts would be really great for, you know, either kids who are in grade level, but they are working below grade level if you've got ell students, because it's got that visual element that could be really fun if, if you've got younger students. So picture prompts would be really great for that. And you also have science and social studies so you can bring in that cross curricular work. Uh You also have just for fun activities and then you also have literary ones as well. So, going through that with your students and just having them pick a few would be such a great practice for them. Um, first off, it lets them have some fun picking out the assignments, but then it also, um, gives them some writing activities to do as well. So back to what quick writes are, um, just in general, they are intended to take about 5 to 10 minutes to write. So no more so than AAA good sized paragraph after you've, you know, kind of developed what a paragraph is, what goes into it and all that good stuff. Um Like I said before and like we've seen, they have a lot of different topics to help engage students and it can be as rigorous or as unstructured as you need it to be. So, you know, I'm a big fan of not making things harder for teachers or students, uh you know, by in the sense of like not giving them busy work. OK. So quick rights are pretty easy to incorporate in a very quick way that doesn't like totally upend your day. So here's an example, the soundtrack of your life. Um The prompt is pretty fun. If you could create a soundtrack for your life, what songs would you include and why? Um And let's say I wanna go ahead and assign that to my students. So when I look at the assignment page, I can add or subtract to this uh prompt as much as I want to like, if you wanted to make a whole soundtrack, think about how many songs that would be like 10 or 15 songs, you know, but they have it set to just two, which is pretty manageable for students, I think. But let's say that you have somebody who's really struggling, um you might lower it down to just a single song. Like what song sort of is you, you know, you can also adjust the link like if you wanted to make it a true, like in depth creative writing, you know, assignment and you wanted it to be an entire soundtrack. Like you could make it into a full essay type of writing, you know, but keeping it just at a paragraph that kind of keeps it in the time frame of just 5 to 10 minutes and then you can make it super easy on yourself too. From a grading standpoint, it can be automatic based on word count. They get to that 75 word count and it will automatically register as a 100 if you want to have a little bit of control over, you know, like what exactly are they saying? Are they practicing complete sentences? Are they practicing, you know, good paragraph construction. I'm gonna assign a 0 to 100% grade. You can set it to that too. You can also grade it on a rubric. So if you wanted to expand that into a complete essay. You know, you could grade it on a rubric and then just apply, you know, like the rubric that is provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Whatever the case may be, you can go up or down in terms of how strict or rigorous you want this to be. You can also add focus areas. So these are ways that you can cue your students to what you're going to be grading on and reminding them. We want complete sentences. We want to make sure that we are hitting the word count and you wanna make sure that you're discussing at least two songs, you know, just reinforcing what the prompt is asking you for. So, and you can see. So I had it set for 375 words and noticed that it expanded that to be, you know, about an hour for them to write. And then when I lower it back down to one paragraph, it drops it down to 10 to 15 minutes. So remember there's a, a sliding scale of how much work it can take to produce an assignment for your students. So quick writes. Pretty awesome things going back into our presentation. Um One last thing about quick writes, just keep in mind that you can use them for a lot of different reasons. They can be for fun, creative writing, um just getting the thought process going, they can help your students build on specific skills and they can help your students understand constructed responses. So they're pretty fantastic things in, in general. All righty. So now we're gonna start wrapping it up. We're gonna talk back about those icann statements. So we're gonna be returning to our jam board. All right. So if you've still got that, I'm gonna drop that into the chat one more time. All righty. So we're actually gonna go, go over to the second slide. Um Think about our different uh icann statements. The first one was I can utilize stu tools to get my students writing at their current level. I can put resources I gather today to use in building a daily writing habit for my students and I can support my students as they advance into higher writing skills. So on a scale from 1 to 10, um just you can stick it or you can put a text box or whatever the case may be uh on a scale from 1 to 10. How do you feel about the icann statements at this point? Nice. All right. It seems like people are feeling pretty good about it um that they, they can take at least one thing from today's presentation and be able to apply it in their daily work with their students. That's awesome to see. All right. Now, you guys can go ahead and continue to add your responses to the I can statements. I'm gonna take it back to the presentation for myself. Um I think I actually answered or used all my poll questions that I needed to, um, especially since it wouldn't pop up after the first one. So at this point, we've got some time to ask any questions that anyone has. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and we're just gonna talk as a group. Um Any questions that anyone has at this point? Are you all feeling good or are you all feeling shy? Ok, I'm seeing some responses. That's good. Awesome. I am really glad to hear it. Um First off, um, before I give you guys the, the survey and the concluding uh slide and wrap things up, I just want to give you guys a shout out for attending during the noon hour. I like this time because I know a lot of people take their lunch at this point and that means I have a better chance of catching you. But I also know that that means you're dedicating some of your, your personal time during the day to listening to me talk and I thank you so much. I appreciate that very, very much. Um Other things. Next month we have a PLC season gearing up and the instructional coaches, we have put together a really awesome presentation. So if you have a chance to attend A PLC where we're going to be presenting, um That's awesome. And I can't wait to see you guys if you um if your MD I is going in a different direction, which is also cool. I know that they've got some really cool things uh that they're, you know, developing for next month. But if you wanna see that presentation, feel free to reach out to either your principal and say, hey, why don't we have this as a team meeting kind of thing? Or you can reach out to the I CS through our office hours and um you know, we can give you the rundown like in a one on one session. Speaking of office hours, one on one sessions with me cover a whole lot of different topics. I support no red ink obviously because we talked about it today near pod um vocabulary. I'm also over sora. So if you ever have any books that you wanna see in the library and you want, you know, to get in on that or talk about novel studies or anything like that, you come to me and I can also talk with you about el a strategies planning uh helping your kids do better on formative, whatever the case may be. I am here to talk to you. So uh you can access all of those links on Epic One. And uh I think that that just about covers it. So I'm gonna share my screen one more time and take us over to the presentation so you guys can uh do your exit survey and I will also drop that link in to the chat if you don't want to mess with Q codes. There we go. All righty and Betsy, I think you have a, can you shut off recording too? I think at this point, I think we're good to turn off the recording.\"), (2062, 626, 3881, \"Joining. All righty. So first off, um you know, as people are getting set up and into the meeting and everything, um there is the QR code reader for Google Chrome extension which allows QR codes to be accessed or accessed from your computer. Um So if you, you know, don't typically sign into your epic email on your phone, uh you have the ability to access the survey from the QR code on your computer as well. And we will also drop the survey link into the chat when the presentation is concluded and we are working today on the presentation building a daily writing habit. I know that that can be a really difficult um habit to establish for our, our students, especially if they're coming from a, a standpoint where they have not been doing a lot of writing. Um It's, it's very similar to any kind of other endurance activity like running a marathon or, you know, taking long road trips or whatever the case may be learning how to paint. You know, you can't go from not doing the activity to all of a sudden being able to, you know, just produce a, a ton of different product in regards to writing or any other kind of creative effort. So we're going to talk about meeting kids where they are and building those habits into bigger and better habits as they go along. So, um remember also that this is a focus on grades five through eight. Some of these activities can definitely be scaled down for younger students and they can be scaled up for older students as well. So it there is that um kind of limiter of grades five through eight, that's where I'm particularly focused on at this point. But remember that you can apply it to students wherever they are at. So first off, we're going to start with some icann statements. Now, these are goals uh that I have set for us as a group. Um By the end of the training, we should all be able to utilize the tools that we're going to discuss in this hour so that we can get students writing at their current level. Um And you should be able to uh by the end of the hour, put resources that I've gathered together um to use in building a daily writing habit for your students, whether your students are writing at the sentence level, whether they are ready for paragraphs or whether they're ready to go on from there. And of course, the most important one that we will be able to support our students as they advance into higher writing skills So our next uh next activity is the jam board. What is writing? So if you can uh go ahead and click that link, if you have the presentation up and I will drop the link directly into the chat, just go ahead and drop a sticky so that you can see or so you can say what is writing exactly. All right, what is it to you? And we will take a couple of minutes to see those responses and talk about them a little bit. And it's OK to say, I, you know, have a very traditional standpoint of what writing is. Uh You could also say that, you know, you could talk about it in a philosophical sense as well. So it doesn't show any options for stickies or anything like yours does weird. Let me see if I can change this. Oh, it says view only. That's what it is. That's what it is. Thank you for speaking up. All righty. If you would press refresh, you will now have the option to comment. I have the link again too when I came in. I think it had already been sent. Absolutely. So for those of us who are coming in a little bit later, we're talking about what writing is, what it can be for our students, how our students can uh can be writers, you know, um does writing simply mean that you've reached sort of the end goal of publishing a book, does it mean that you write on the daily? Does it mean that you are a capable communicator? I'm seeing some really wonderful um expression. That's a very big one, explaining your brain, putting thoughts on paper. OK. This is wonderful. I'm loving what you guys are seeing or saying and this is all very true. All right. So when we talk about writing, sometimes we have a very formal concept in our mind of what writing is, um that it has to be sort of like, it must be essays or it must be, you know, like publishing a book or publishing an academic paper. And those are certainly long term goals for a lot of people, especially if they um move into, you know, college education where they want to focus on getting published, uh, you know, as an academic writer, but it can be something as, as personal as keeping a daily journal. Um I'm a daily journal person. I have been keeping a journal since I was in middle school. And for me, it's a very therapeutic process. And in all honesty, I wouldn't have found that pathway as a person, if not for having good writing skills to begin with. So I really have to be thankful for my, my teachers in upper elementary and middle school for instilling those habits in me so that I could then transfer, transfer it into personal expression. And the same thing is true for a lot of students who are looking for a creative outlet. Um Creative writing is a wonderful uh pathway for expression for our students. So the thing is writing can be a lot of different things and that's not even touching on things like college and career readiness where you think about all the different forms of communication that technically are writing, think about filling out an application, writing an email to a professor. Um you know, being able to prepare some good interview answers when you know that you're going to be interviewed for like a President's leadership class or something like that. Um All of those things are writing, even if they don't necessarily take the form of, you know, typing or putting pen to paper. Um Another element is, you know, public speaking, um being able to discuss things in a well thought out manner in class, you know, all of those, those activities rely on writing skills, even if we don't necessarily say this is a writing skill. So I think you guys are in a really great place to understand what we're gonna be talking about here, sort of what the long term goal is with encouraging writing for our students and just realizing that the activities we talk about today, they are starting points, but there's really no end for how far your students can go with writing. So we're gonna head back to the presentation at this point and we're gonna talk a little bit about our agenda for the day. So we're gonna talk about the importance of daily writing. And I think, I think everyone's on the same page with that, which is awesome to see. Then we're gonna talk about um techniques we can use to build uh skills where our, our students are struggling with sentences. Uh Then we'll move into paragraphs, graphic organizers, constructed responses and quick rights. So you can kind of see that it starts at that very basic level of sentences and it builds from there. So next is the importance of writing. So like a lot of you, I am in, I'm working through letters training at the moment. And um the thing about it is uh the importance of writing is that, you know, every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities and sometimes that gets neglected um because we focus on other things or because um there might be other difficulties that our students are encountering. There can be a lot of barriers to instilling those writing habits in those very early years. But writing activities improve students, grammar and reading skills and vice versa. Writing gives your students also the power of expression and this is vital to their sense of self and future development. So really quickly, I'm gonna, I'm gonna launch a poll um for all of you uh just asking basically how often and this, if you're not a teacher, no problem. Um That's not a worry but just how often are your students writing on a regular basis? Let's see. Where are my poles? Mm. That's interesting because I set them up. Alrighty, maybe I need to stop chair for a second. I will stop here for a second and see if that allows me to set. There's my pole. All right. So the question is how often do your students write? And it, you know, there's no shame if it's rarely, there's no shame if it is on a monthly basis. Obviously, we wanna try to get it going where it is a daily kind of activity for our students. Um But this is an honest and open communication at this point. So think about where your students are at right now. All righty and I'll give it another few seconds and then we'll end the poll and show results. OK? So as you guys can see from that, um a lot of our students are writing on a weekly basis, which is great. That's a wonderful place to start. Um And you might be envisioning like when I say, how often are your students writing? You might be actually thinking more of like extended writing as opposed to, you know, smaller pieces of writing. So keep in mind also that the, you know, the all kinds of writing count in terms of this uh question. All righty. So with that being said, I'm gonna share screen once again and head back to my presentation. Now, the next thing we're gonna talk about is sentence building. All right. And just to give you an overview of what we're going to be looking at specifically with sent sentence building. We're gonna talk about sentence frames, sentence starters and checking for complete sentences. So keep in mind uh if your student has like a critical misunderstanding of the parts of a sentence, then that means you probably need to walk it back and give them some grammar remediation. So like take it back to that concept of like parts of speech and show them how the pieces of sentences can fit together to make independent clauses and dependent clauses. Um However, with that being said, um we're just focusing on the actual crafting of sentences. So bear in mind, you can like I said, scale it back or up as you need to for your students. So starting with sentence frames. OK. So you might be asking what is a sentence frame and it's a preconstructed frame that allows your student to fill in the gaps. So this would be useful for students who are really just getting started. Um This is very guided writing. Um It also allows your students to help build their response faster. So if you have a student who really is struggling or they feel like they're taking too long, sometimes providing them with a sentence frame to help them formulate, the answer can be really, really helpful. And another place where you can instill that practice very quickly. So imagine that you are meeting one on one with that student and you show them how to use a sentence frame, then they might be able to use that sentence frame as they are completing open ended questions in a core curriculum. So as an example, if you give them like if it's a question that says, what is your opinion about blank? You could use a sentence frame that shows them to say, I think that this is and then they put their opinion right in there. So instead of students having that instinct to just say, you know, like, oh, I guess the book was terrible. You know, they're formulating in it into a more complete thought um that reflects the language of the question. So that's a really great way that you can show them the technique and then apply it into the work that they're already doing. So you're not creating more work for them, you're just showing them how they can be more effective in building up some writing practice in their core. So next, we're gonna look at a few examples of um sentence frames and these are actually kind of cross curricular to be honest, there's a few question or a few frames that refer to um math concepts and science. And I also included the source for those examples. So you can, you know, dive in and apply those as, as you would like. So here are some examples and you can see that these really start very low level. OK. So very easily scaled down to kindergarten, first grade level and very easy to, to adjust if you have a student who is, you know, in middle school, but performing lower and you can see that it can be um you know, pretty extensive and you're bringing in some of that academic vocabulary where it says like based on the experiment, I can infer that the blank will increase and the blank will decrease. Um you can restructure that and adjust it. And the nice thing about it is inference is found in social studies and el A. So teaching your student a sentence frame that talks about inference, they could imply they could apply that to multiple subject areas. And obviously, every situation is going to be a little bit different. Um you know, a sentence frame that works for 1/4 grader may not necessarily be the right sentence frame for an eighth grader. Um But just showing them that structure can get them built building the habit of answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions. The next thing is sentence starters. And so this is a little bit different from uh a sentence frame rather than them uh or rather than the students like filling in the gaps, the sentence starters will start the sentence, but then the students have to fill in all of the rest of the information. So really, this is ideal for all students. Um but if you have students really operating at that very, very low level, uh they might need a little bit more progression. So, um think about, uh you know, think about your students who continually tell you things like, I don't know how to start. I'm not sure how to, to get this going or I'm not sure what to say at this point. Um You know, sentence uh starters can be a really, really good uh choice for them. Um text evidence, which I've got linked in here is a great place for us to start with sentence starters because that comes up so often not only in the standards and in the state tests, but really uh you know, think about all of the times in core where we see questions where it's like use text evidence and then think about in high school and college when you have to provide evidence of where you got your answer. So text evidence, the sooner you start that the more beneficial it's going to be for your students. So I've linked in my text evidence, sentence starters sheet. This is a really simple document um that just provides a lot of different examples of how you can start off a sentence that you need to provide some text evidence for. So one thing that could be really helpful for your students is sending this to them and having them printed off or if you've got a printer, printing it for them, but whatever the case may be so that they've got it kind of handy and they can refer to it whenever they're going to be writing. Now, keep in mind also, this can be helpful in core curriculum when they're answering open ended text evidence questions. It's really great when they're doing test prep because there's going to be those text evidence type and uh questions on the state test. And also when you get ready to start teaching like informational writing or argumentative writing, this can be implemented in the essays as well. So this is helpful on a lot of different levels. And as you can see, there are quite a few of them uh to choose from. So, you know, you can let your students kind of play around with that and try different techniques until they find one that really feels comfortable for them. Alrighty. And our last sentence building technique is checking for complete sentences. Now, this one is probably the most sophisticated I would say because they actually need to be, you know, kind of taking it to that next level of, of understanding of knowledge. Um So you can use a sample um you know, whether it's off of no red ink as an example or the State department's writing section or their own work, you can practice with your students checking for complete sentences. So really if you break it down to its simplest level. Uh a complete sentence needs three things. You have to have that capital letter at the beginning. You have to have in punctuation and you have to have at least one independent clause with a subject and a verb. And obviously sentences can get more sophisticated as they go on. But those are the basics. So, and remember we're, we're starting where kids are OK. Um And keep in mind also that if your students have that, that basic misunderstanding of the grammar itself, you can take that back into practice, um maybe give them some of the basics once again. Um Just to make sure that those, those concepts are cemented in their mind before you are having them check their own work. Now, one other thing is checking for complete sentences is a part of the writers checklist. Um So if you've got fifth or eighth graders, when they head into the um the test, you know, the state test at the end of the year, they will be given a copy of the writer's checklist. And if you practice using that writer's checklist with your students throughout the year, they're gonna feel more comfortable using it by themselves when they're taking the test. So just keep that in mind that that is a pretty handy test, taking tip as you are prepping for that season of life. So next thing is I'm gonna turn on my, actually turn on one of my poles. Um And it's the after sentence section question. Which technique do you think? Um there it's been shared? OK. Which technique do you think, did that pop up for you guys? Because it's saying that it has been shared? Yeah, it is. OK. Good. All right. Which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? And then go ahead and let's see. Is it gonna let me launch it? Hm. It's just showing on your shared screen? Yeah, I think it's stop sharing. Ah OK. Thank you very much. Now, it's still uh not letting me launch it. OK. So in the chat, uh just tell me which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? Whether it's sentence frames, checking for complete sentences or sentence starters? I'm liking all the people saying all of them. That's really awesome. Sentence starters are another really great one that's just pretty much grab and go, you know, because it's very easy to implement in a very short demonstration with your students. Practice it a few times and then they're able to start taking it, you know, into what they're working on. OK. Well, I'm going to go ahead and share screen once more and head back to the presentation and we're heading into paragraphs at this point. So quick overview of what we're gonna talk about with paragraphs, paragraph frames similar to sentence frames and we're gonna move it a little bit deeper into our understanding of using text evidence with the race strategy. So moving into paragraph frames, um these are students who have mastered complete sentences and they're ready for building paragraphs. Um And in a lot of ways, uh building paragraphs is honestly easier. Once, you know, students, it seems like some students struggle with the basic building blocks of sentences, but building paragraphs can be simpler for them. I, I'm not sure what the, what the psychology is of that. But uh it's just anecdotally from my uh my use of paragraphs with students, it seems like once they've grasped sentences, paragraphs as a building block bigger than sentences is just really simple to grasp. So they're very helpful when you're teaching different types of paragraphs. Um So if you're teaching the structure of different kinds of paragraphs, like narrative, uh description, compare and contrast using a paragraph frame can help them understand like what are you envisioning? And I, I think with writing especially because it is so creative and it is so grounded in expression. Sometimes having a visual of what it can look like shows students what they're capable of. And just fy i another kind of test taking tip just because that's on all of our minds. Um The Oklahoma State Department of Ed website, they have a whole writing section that has student examples. So you can see good student examples, poor student examples. I think these are really helpful to show students because it shows them this is what a person your age most likely can produce. Um Some kids really get anxiety about those things because uh they feel almost like imposter syndrome, you know, like, oh I'm not a good writer, you know, and they can see you're probably a better writer than you think you are. But going back to paragraph frames, um the race paragraph frame that we're gonna talk about next perfect for text evidence. But other types of paragraph frames like I've talked about before, narrative, informational, descriptive and so on. And I included a link to a scholastic uh assignment um that really builds out a lot of really cool paragraph frames. Um So keep in mind also that showing your students how to use paragraph frames once again, can be really helpful for those state test. Uh open ended questions and again, you're not creating more work for them. You're just instilling the expectation that they will answer, you know, open ended questions with complete sentences and paragraphs when the situation calls for it. So as an example, if you get a question in bright thinker that says, what were the three causes for the election of Teddy Roosevelt, you know, in or a social studies class, then your student would obviously need to organize a paragraph that incorporates those three reasons. So, you know, just kind of building that expectation doesn't create more work um for either you or the student, it just increases the expectation. So if you have students who kind of struggle with writing because they feel like it's more work, these techniques that we're talking about can really help alleviate that because it, it becomes a habit. You know, you do it instinctively as an example. Yesterday, I was uh talking with my no red ink, uh support people and one is older than me and the other one is younger than me. And I, I joked with them and I said, hey, have you guys adjusted to saying 2023 in your writing yet? And the, the younger person said I still am writing 2022. But my handwriting is so terrible that it doesn't matter. And I said, you know, as an elder millennial, I think I might be the last person that was taught to write everything in cursive and very neatly after that, I feel like all, all the teachers at my school just were like, ah, forget about it. Um, so with that being said, you know, um, for me at that being of that age, um, cursive writing is just a habit. I don't even have to think about it. But even somebody who's like, five years younger than me cursive can be something that they have to think about because they didn't practice it so much. And writing is exactly the same way. Um, for all of us who, you know, we've worked through Bachelor's degrees. Most of us have worked through master's degrees. Some of you rock stars out there are working on phd s like it doesn't take any effort to be able to produce a lot of writing and very quickly and very professionally, but you have to scale back your expectation. You know, think about your students and think about where they are and even maybe picture yourself when you were that age and what you were capable of doing. So just bear in mind. Uh you know, once you start building those habits, it really takes off, but sometimes building the habit in the first place can be the hard part. So next, we're gonna talk about the race strategy. So race just stands for restate the question answer the question, cite text evidence and explain. OK. So it's super, super applicable for a lot of different types of open ended questions where you're having to explain your answer c text evidence. If it has any of that kind of lingo in the question, your students can use this strategy. And once again building that habit, once you've done it for a few days or weeks, it just becomes instinctive to use the lingo that you've created with your text evidence, starters and to follow this strategy, I also linked in here, uh a link for further reading. So keep in mind that you've, you've got that available to you. Um And we're gonna just go through the steps of the strategy. So restating the question, this is one that you know, it relates. So um so well to student success, when they need to write a complete sentence, if you just restate the question and use the language of the question in your answer, uh Half the battle of writing a complete sentence is over, you know, um it's all there in the question. So you remove the question word from the question and write it as a statement. So this itself restating the question as a sentence that could be an activity that you practice with your students. So an example would be who was responsible for the broken vase. Like they're reading a story about, you know, some kids who broke a vase. Um You could reply in your answer, Jennifer was responsible for the broken vase. So you've taken out the question word of who and you've put your answer in there and you've got a sentence, it's that easy, then you're going to answer the question. So you restate and answer the question that can happen in the same sentence. But it's crucial to make sure that the entire question is answered. So the technique that you can take into this with your students is have them like underline or point to or circle or highlight whatever you want the words in the sentence that are, you know, basically showing them what's being asked. And if you think about it, that's an important technique that translates across curricular or cross subject areas. You know, think about reading a word problem in math and how you have to break down what's actually being asked of you in that word problem so that you don't accidentally do it opposite of how you're supposed to for the word problem. The same thing is true in el A or an opened in science question or social studies, make sure that the entire question is answered. And once again, it's a habit so that students, you know, slow down and read thoroughly. Next is citing text evidence. We talked about this previously with sentence starters. So again, we're building on what we've done in the previous section and bringing it into a paragraph and to go along with that for the explained portion where they explain how their text evidence supports their answer. Um I have a document for explanation, sentence starters to help them. And so, you know, if you think about writing as being a progression, you know, when you pick up habits and tools at the sentence level, it doesn't mean that you abandon them when you get to the paragraph level. Here's two places where you're actually using those uh those sentence starters to help you write a really great paragraph. And also keep in mind when you're talking to your students about the expectation of writing with complete sentences and creating paragraphs to open ended questions. You can do that with science, you can do it with social studies, you can do it with El A and just every time they're doing that they are writing and they are adding to their habit of writing. So then when you know, they move up to the next grade or when they have to answer a constructive response on the state test or they have to write essays or whatever the case may be, they're going to be ready for it. So these are pretty powerful tools that your students can apply towards their own learning and understanding. So our next section is graphic organizers. All righty. Now, graphic organizers are one of my favorite things about El A. Um Once again, can be applied to a lot of different situations in El A and it can go cross curricular with science and social studies as well. So bear in mind that these kinds of graphic organizers we're looking at, you might be showing them to your students in a lot of different areas. Um Keep in mind also. And I think I talk about this a little bit later in the slides too, but I wanted to reiterate it now when your students go into the testing room. All right. All of the, the comforts of home are stripped away. They are in an unfamiliar place. They're sitting in a group of students that they don't know, probably um they might have AAA test administrator that they don't know. And so test anxiety is a real thing. And it can be, uh, kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know, and it's hard, it's hard to remember what it's like when you're a little kid, um, when you've, you know, gone decades and years way beyond that. But if you teach your students how to use things, like taking notes, graphic organizers using scratch paper when they're, you know, working online, they can take those habits into the testing room with them. All right. And so this example that I'm gonna show you um on the next slide is one of those really good graphic organizers that if you practice that with your students, they can have that visual picture in their mind as they're going into the test room. So when they encounter, you know, a question about like what's the main idea of this passage? They could jot that graphic organizer down and fill it in with the passage that they just read and they're gonna feel successful, you know, they're gonna feel capable and they're gonna know that they can answer those questions with, you know, 100% correctness because they've got that visual in front of them to help them. So remember, graphic organizers really helpful to help your students recall what they do know. Um So just to talk about graphic organizers in general, they help us track info. And for you as the teacher, they can also help see where your students have gaps in their information. So for instance, if your student is filling out this main ide graphic organizer and they, they know the main idea right there, like they read the passage and they were like, this is the main idea and you're thinking, oh, but what if you have to provide text evidence and a question about that, you know, where are you going to be able to show me that that is in the passage? That's when you can say, let's take this a step back and actually look for the supporting details because you're right, you found the main idea, but I need to see more. I need to know more about what you're doing. Um So graphic organizers can be really helpful in that regard for the teacher as well. They make a nice visual representation for written responses. Um I love outlines. I find them to be very, very helpful. Um not only as a writer myself but also for students because it shows them sort of almost like a checklist, you know, like first in my introduction, I'm going to write about this and then, oh yeah, I forgot I need to put in my thesis statement and I need to make sure that I've done a hook of some sort to pull my reader in. Um you know, then it makes body paragraphs very, very quick and easy to put together. So outlines and graphic organizers kind of go hand in hand in being super helpful for getting our writing organized. Now, in contrast to sentence and paragraph frames. Um graphic organizers allow for a lot more fluidity. You know, it's more about the planning and the creativity rather than having um sort of the answer built, you know what I'm saying? Um At this point with a graphic organizer, like there's still that scaffolding that's happening with the graphic organizer. But it is also allowing us to, you know, give more freedom to our students, which I did notice on our jam board, some people wrote freedom of expression. You know, when we're talking about a sentence frame, there's very little uh freedom of expression. Then when you move into graphic organizers, like a brainstorm as an example, that's when you really get to see students, let it go and, and have a lot of fun with the creativity that they're having. And remember once again, reiterating that the more we practice using graphic organizers, the better our students will remember them and be able to use them when they go into the testing room. So I was going to uh like actually go through a sample text and provide a sa uh a sample question where we could break down this graphic organizer. But I think in the name of, of time and respecting the time that we have left, um you know, I will kind of give you the gist of the text and then the sample question will make more sense. Um Basically, the sample text uh is about, you know, light disruption. When people have a lot of lights on, on the coastline in Florida, it can cause sea turtle hatchlings to get kind of disoriented. Instead of going towards the sea, they turn and go inland. So basically, they're trying to uh you know, during the the hatching season, they're trying to get people to turn their lights off a little bit more during those hours when they know the turtles are going to be hatching. So kind of cool. Anyway, um moving on into constructive responses, which we've been talking about quite a bit um with open ended questioning, but we're gonna go more in depth with that here. So basically, a constructed response is any kind of open ended question um that goes beyond the yes or no. And they're wanting you to build a response usually centered around text evidence. Um Now, keep in mind uh that's where you're incorporating things like sentence starters and paragraph frames. Um You have a combination of both of those techniques when you're putting together a constructed response and you also have that prompt. Um Think back to when we were talking about using the language of the question in your answer. I if you do that, usually the people who score constructed responses, uh you know, they kind of have a, a rubric or, or some metrics that they're hoping writers are hitting. And so using the language of the question, you're incorporating the vocab that they're looking for. So for instance, if the question says infer and your student also puts infer into their sentence, then, you know, that kind of is like a point in their favor automatically because they're using that lingo um getting students used to making constructive responses helps in a lot of different ways. Um First off, you can build really big paragraphs um just by following like the basic steps of constructive responses. So the example that I previously gave was something like, you know, name three reasons. So that constructed response, it already has three reasons built in. So each one of those reasons is gonna get its own sentence. All right, then you have sort of an opening statement uh where you reflect the language of the question, you have your three reasons and then you have your concluding sentence that explains your answer. So right there, right off the bat, you have a five sentence paragraph. So your student who maybe a few weeks ago was like, I don't know how to write paragraphs or I don't know how to write sentences or they don't even tell you that they don't know how to write those things. They just answer ID K, you know, you can leave them in a very short amount of time from being not a writer to being able to write a paragraph and a pretty big paragraph to boot inferences also become a lot easier. Um especially when students get into the habit of using the language of the question in their answer. Um They're kind of picking up on the hint that is being provided to them in the question. So I think that that's one of the things kids struggle a lot with. When they read a question, they don't really slow down and think. All right, when they're asking me to infer, they're basically saying, make an educated guess. Um And then I have to provide it where I got that, you know, inspiration for that educated guess. All right, so you kind of do that breakdown, like when you're building the question into an answer, you're thinking about what they're really asking of us. So it kind of takes it from just sort of superficially reading the question and makes it more of an in depth active reading activity, but all in a very short amount of time as well. Um And like I say, at the end that then allows it to be in easier to introduce greater depth of knowledge because they're going through those mental steps of reading the question, transferring it into the beginning of their answer and then going into the text to find their answer and then explaining how it supports their inference or their answer, whatever the case may be. So as they go through that process of writing, their reading techniques become better, so pretty powerful stuff. Um a few weeks, well, actually, I think it was longer ago Lauren asked me to provide some research that was about writing and its impact on reading. And I had a, I had always known this as a reader and a writer and as a teacher of those things, but like, actually reading the evidence that supports that they're so symbiotic if you want to be a better reader, be a better writer. And if you wanna write, you need to read, I mean, they, they are so tied together, you know, it's amazing. I it was actually a really fun. Uh couple of hours of research, I really enjoyed it. But anyway, with that being said, now we're gonna move into using an actual supplemental um where you can add some activities to your students uh workload, but in a very, very um easy to handle manner. OK. So the next thing we're gonna talk about is quick rights with no red ink. All right. So first off, these are students or these are ideal for students at any level of mastery. Um No, writing has a lot of different quick rights that are related to skills. So if you've got those students who are needing that practice, like at the grammatical level of sentence construction, uh you've got some quick rights that you can give them if you've got students who have more of a creative writing bend. Um They have quick rights for that if you want to tie it to text evidence, um they have literary analysis quick rights. And if you've got students who are just kind of reluctant, like they just are struggling. Um One thing that I think would be fantastic to do with a student is to actually go into the quick rights, which are linked right here and show them some of the options and then ask them to choose which ones they would like to write about. You know, it's all about expression. So let them have, you know, the, the the agency to pick their own. So they have featured. And when you click into that, you can see a lot of different options over here on the side. If you've got students who are maybe pretty low level uh readers or they're really struggling with, you know, the whole writing thing to begin with. Try some of these like for fun, um different kinds of prompts, like picture prompts. I was talking with the narrating people yesterday and I said, you know, I feel like the picture prompts would be really great for, you know, either kids who are in grade level, but they are working below grade level if you've got ell students, because it's got that visual element that could be really fun if, if you've got younger students. So picture prompts would be really great for that. And you also have science and social studies so you can bring in that cross curricular work. Uh You also have just for fun activities and then you also have literary ones as well. So, going through that with your students and just having them pick a few would be such a great practice for them. Um, first off, it lets them have some fun picking out the assignments, but then it also, um, gives them some writing activities to do as well. So back to what quick writes are, um, just in general, they are intended to take about 5 to 10 minutes to write. So no more so than AAA good sized paragraph after you've, you know, kind of developed what a paragraph is, what goes into it and all that good stuff. Um Like I said before and like we've seen, they have a lot of different topics to help engage students and it can be as rigorous or as unstructured as you need it to be. So, you know, I'm a big fan of not making things harder for teachers or students, uh you know, by in the sense of like not giving them busy work. OK. So quick rights are pretty easy to incorporate in a very quick way that doesn't like totally upend your day. So here's an example, the soundtrack of your life. Um The prompt is pretty fun. If you could create a soundtrack for your life, what songs would you include and why? Um And let's say I wanna go ahead and assign that to my students. So when I look at the assignment page, I can add or subtract to this uh prompt as much as I want to like, if you wanted to make a whole soundtrack, think about how many songs that would be like 10 or 15 songs, you know, but they have it set to just two, which is pretty manageable for students, I think. But let's say that you have somebody who's really struggling, um you might lower it down to just a single song. Like what song sort of is you, you know, you can also adjust the link like if you wanted to make it a true, like in depth creative writing, you know, assignment and you wanted it to be an entire soundtrack. Like you could make it into a full essay type of writing, you know, but keeping it just at a paragraph that kind of keeps it in the time frame of just 5 to 10 minutes and then you can make it super easy on yourself too. From a grading standpoint, it can be automatic based on word count. They get to that 75 word count and it will automatically register as a 100 if you want to have a little bit of control over, you know, like what exactly are they saying? Are they practicing complete sentences? Are they practicing, you know, good paragraph construction. I'm gonna assign a 0 to 100% grade. You can set it to that too. You can also grade it on a rubric. So if you wanted to expand that into a complete essay. You know, you could grade it on a rubric and then just apply, you know, like the rubric that is provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Whatever the case may be, you can go up or down in terms of how strict or rigorous you want this to be. You can also add focus areas. So these are ways that you can cue your students to what you're going to be grading on and reminding them. We want complete sentences. We want to make sure that we are hitting the word count and you wanna make sure that you're discussing at least two songs, you know, just reinforcing what the prompt is asking you for. So, and you can see. So I had it set for 375 words and noticed that it expanded that to be, you know, about an hour for them to write. And then when I lower it back down to one paragraph, it drops it down to 10 to 15 minutes. So remember there's a, a sliding scale of how much work it can take to produce an assignment for your students. So quick writes. Pretty awesome things going back into our presentation. Um One last thing about quick writes, just keep in mind that you can use them for a lot of different reasons. They can be for fun, creative writing, um just getting the thought process going, they can help your students build on specific skills and they can help your students understand constructed responses. So they're pretty fantastic things in, in general. All righty. So now we're gonna start wrapping it up. We're gonna talk back about those icann statements. So we're gonna be returning to our jam board. All right. So if you've still got that, I'm gonna drop that into the chat one more time. All righty. So we're actually gonna go, go over to the second slide. Um Think about our different uh icann statements. The first one was I can utilize stu tools to get my students writing at their current level. I can put resources I gather today to use in building a daily writing habit for my students and I can support my students as they advance into higher writing skills. So on a scale from 1 to 10, um just you can stick it or you can put a text box or whatever the case may be uh on a scale from 1 to 10. How do you feel about the icann statements at this point? Nice. All right. It seems like people are feeling pretty good about it um that they, they can take at least one thing from today's presentation and be able to apply it in their daily work with their students. That's awesome to see. All right. Now, you guys can go ahead and continue to add your responses to the I can statements. I'm gonna take it back to the presentation for myself. Um I think I actually answered or used all my poll questions that I needed to, um, especially since it wouldn't pop up after the first one. So at this point, we've got some time to ask any questions that anyone has. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and we're just gonna talk as a group. Um Any questions that anyone has at this point? Are you all feeling good or are you all feeling shy? Ok, I'm seeing some responses. That's good. Awesome. I am really glad to hear it. Um First off, um, before I give you guys the, the survey and the concluding uh slide and wrap things up, I just want to give you guys a shout out for attending during the noon hour. I like this time because I know a lot of people take their lunch at this point and that means I have a better chance of catching you. But I also know that that means you're dedicating some of your, your personal time during the day to listening to me talk and I thank you so much. I appreciate that very, very much. Um Other things. Next month we have a PLC season gearing up and the instructional coaches, we have put together a really awesome presentation. So if you have a chance to attend A PLC where we're going to be presenting, um That's awesome. And I can't wait to see you guys if you um if your MD I is going in a different direction, which is also cool. I know that they've got some really cool things uh that they're, you know, developing for next month. But if you wanna see that presentation, feel free to reach out to either your principal and say, hey, why don't we have this as a team meeting kind of thing? Or you can reach out to the I CS through our office hours and um you know, we can give you the rundown like in a one on one session. Speaking of office hours, one on one sessions with me cover a whole lot of different topics. I support no red ink obviously because we talked about it today near pod um vocabulary. I'm also over sora. So if you ever have any books that you wanna see in the library and you want, you know, to get in on that or talk about novel studies or anything like that, you come to me and I can also talk with you about el a strategies planning uh helping your kids do better on formative, whatever the case may be. I am here to talk to you. So uh you can access all of those links on Epic One. And uh I think that that just about covers it. So I'm gonna share my screen one more time and take us over to the presentation so you guys can uh do your exit survey and I will also drop that link in to the chat if you don't want to mess with Q codes. There we go. All righty and Betsy, I think you have a, can you shut off recording too? I think at this point, I think we're good to turn off the recording.\"), (2063, 626, 3881, \"Joining. All righty. So first off, um you know, as people are getting set up and into the meeting and everything, um there is the QR code reader for Google Chrome extension which allows QR codes to be accessed or accessed from your computer. Um So if you, you know, don't typically sign into your epic email on your phone, uh you have the ability to access the survey from the QR code on your computer as well. And we will also drop the survey link into the chat when the presentation is concluded and we are working today on the presentation building a daily writing habit. I know that that can be a really difficult um habit to establish for our, our students, especially if they're coming from a, a standpoint where they have not been doing a lot of writing. Um It's, it's very similar to any kind of other endurance activity like running a marathon or, you know, taking long road trips or whatever the case may be learning how to paint. You know, you can't go from not doing the activity to all of a sudden being able to, you know, just produce a, a ton of different product in regards to writing or any other kind of creative effort. So we're going to talk about meeting kids where they are and building those habits into bigger and better habits as they go along. So, um remember also that this is a focus on grades five through eight. Some of these activities can definitely be scaled down for younger students and they can be scaled up for older students as well. So it there is that um kind of limiter of grades five through eight, that's where I'm particularly focused on at this point. But remember that you can apply it to students wherever they are at. So first off, we're going to start with some icann statements. Now, these are goals uh that I have set for us as a group. Um By the end of the training, we should all be able to utilize the tools that we're going to discuss in this hour so that we can get students writing at their current level. Um And you should be able to uh by the end of the hour, put resources that I've gathered together um to use in building a daily writing habit for your students, whether your students are writing at the sentence level, whether they are ready for paragraphs or whether they're ready to go on from there. And of course, the most important one that we will be able to support our students as they advance into higher writing skills So our next uh next activity is the jam board. What is writing? So if you can uh go ahead and click that link, if you have the presentation up and I will drop the link directly into the chat, just go ahead and drop a sticky so that you can see or so you can say what is writing exactly. All right, what is it to you? And we will take a couple of minutes to see those responses and talk about them a little bit. And it's OK to say, I, you know, have a very traditional standpoint of what writing is. Uh You could also say that, you know, you could talk about it in a philosophical sense as well. So it doesn't show any options for stickies or anything like yours does weird. Let me see if I can change this. Oh, it says view only. That's what it is. That's what it is. Thank you for speaking up. All righty. If you would press refresh, you will now have the option to comment. I have the link again too when I came in. I think it had already been sent. Absolutely. So for those of us who are coming in a little bit later, we're talking about what writing is, what it can be for our students, how our students can uh can be writers, you know, um does writing simply mean that you've reached sort of the end goal of publishing a book, does it mean that you write on the daily? Does it mean that you are a capable communicator? I'm seeing some really wonderful um expression. That's a very big one, explaining your brain, putting thoughts on paper. OK. This is wonderful. I'm loving what you guys are seeing or saying and this is all very true. All right. So when we talk about writing, sometimes we have a very formal concept in our mind of what writing is, um that it has to be sort of like, it must be essays or it must be, you know, like publishing a book or publishing an academic paper. And those are certainly long term goals for a lot of people, especially if they um move into, you know, college education where they want to focus on getting published, uh, you know, as an academic writer, but it can be something as, as personal as keeping a daily journal. Um I'm a daily journal person. I have been keeping a journal since I was in middle school. And for me, it's a very therapeutic process. And in all honesty, I wouldn't have found that pathway as a person, if not for having good writing skills to begin with. So I really have to be thankful for my, my teachers in upper elementary and middle school for instilling those habits in me so that I could then transfer, transfer it into personal expression. And the same thing is true for a lot of students who are looking for a creative outlet. Um Creative writing is a wonderful uh pathway for expression for our students. So the thing is writing can be a lot of different things and that's not even touching on things like college and career readiness where you think about all the different forms of communication that technically are writing, think about filling out an application, writing an email to a professor. Um you know, being able to prepare some good interview answers when you know that you're going to be interviewed for like a President's leadership class or something like that. Um All of those things are writing, even if they don't necessarily take the form of, you know, typing or putting pen to paper. Um Another element is, you know, public speaking, um being able to discuss things in a well thought out manner in class, you know, all of those, those activities rely on writing skills, even if we don't necessarily say this is a writing skill. So I think you guys are in a really great place to understand what we're gonna be talking about here, sort of what the long term goal is with encouraging writing for our students and just realizing that the activities we talk about today, they are starting points, but there's really no end for how far your students can go with writing. So we're gonna head back to the presentation at this point and we're gonna talk a little bit about our agenda for the day. So we're gonna talk about the importance of daily writing. And I think, I think everyone's on the same page with that, which is awesome to see. Then we're gonna talk about um techniques we can use to build uh skills where our, our students are struggling with sentences. Uh Then we'll move into paragraphs, graphic organizers, constructed responses and quick rights. So you can kind of see that it starts at that very basic level of sentences and it builds from there. So next is the importance of writing. So like a lot of you, I am in, I'm working through letters training at the moment. And um the thing about it is uh the importance of writing is that, you know, every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities and sometimes that gets neglected um because we focus on other things or because um there might be other difficulties that our students are encountering. There can be a lot of barriers to instilling those writing habits in those very early years. But writing activities improve students, grammar and reading skills and vice versa. Writing gives your students also the power of expression and this is vital to their sense of self and future development. So really quickly, I'm gonna, I'm gonna launch a poll um for all of you uh just asking basically how often and this, if you're not a teacher, no problem. Um That's not a worry but just how often are your students writing on a regular basis? Let's see. Where are my poles? Mm. That's interesting because I set them up. Alrighty, maybe I need to stop chair for a second. I will stop here for a second and see if that allows me to set. There's my pole. All right. So the question is how often do your students write? And it, you know, there's no shame if it's rarely, there's no shame if it is on a monthly basis. Obviously, we wanna try to get it going where it is a daily kind of activity for our students. Um But this is an honest and open communication at this point. So think about where your students are at right now. All righty and I'll give it another few seconds and then we'll end the poll and show results. OK? So as you guys can see from that, um a lot of our students are writing on a weekly basis, which is great. That's a wonderful place to start. Um And you might be envisioning like when I say, how often are your students writing? You might be actually thinking more of like extended writing as opposed to, you know, smaller pieces of writing. So keep in mind also that the, you know, the all kinds of writing count in terms of this uh question. All righty. So with that being said, I'm gonna share screen once again and head back to my presentation. Now, the next thing we're gonna talk about is sentence building. All right. And just to give you an overview of what we're going to be looking at specifically with sent sentence building. We're gonna talk about sentence frames, sentence starters and checking for complete sentences. So keep in mind uh if your student has like a critical misunderstanding of the parts of a sentence, then that means you probably need to walk it back and give them some grammar remediation. So like take it back to that concept of like parts of speech and show them how the pieces of sentences can fit together to make independent clauses and dependent clauses. Um However, with that being said, um we're just focusing on the actual crafting of sentences. So bear in mind, you can like I said, scale it back or up as you need to for your students. So starting with sentence frames. OK. So you might be asking what is a sentence frame and it's a preconstructed frame that allows your student to fill in the gaps. So this would be useful for students who are really just getting started. Um This is very guided writing. Um It also allows your students to help build their response faster. So if you have a student who really is struggling or they feel like they're taking too long, sometimes providing them with a sentence frame to help them formulate, the answer can be really, really helpful. And another place where you can instill that practice very quickly. So imagine that you are meeting one on one with that student and you show them how to use a sentence frame, then they might be able to use that sentence frame as they are completing open ended questions in a core curriculum. So as an example, if you give them like if it's a question that says, what is your opinion about blank? You could use a sentence frame that shows them to say, I think that this is and then they put their opinion right in there. So instead of students having that instinct to just say, you know, like, oh, I guess the book was terrible. You know, they're formulating in it into a more complete thought um that reflects the language of the question. So that's a really great way that you can show them the technique and then apply it into the work that they're already doing. So you're not creating more work for them, you're just showing them how they can be more effective in building up some writing practice in their core. So next, we're gonna look at a few examples of um sentence frames and these are actually kind of cross curricular to be honest, there's a few question or a few frames that refer to um math concepts and science. And I also included the source for those examples. So you can, you know, dive in and apply those as, as you would like. So here are some examples and you can see that these really start very low level. OK. So very easily scaled down to kindergarten, first grade level and very easy to, to adjust if you have a student who is, you know, in middle school, but performing lower and you can see that it can be um you know, pretty extensive and you're bringing in some of that academic vocabulary where it says like based on the experiment, I can infer that the blank will increase and the blank will decrease. Um you can restructure that and adjust it. And the nice thing about it is inference is found in social studies and el A. So teaching your student a sentence frame that talks about inference, they could imply they could apply that to multiple subject areas. And obviously, every situation is going to be a little bit different. Um you know, a sentence frame that works for 1/4 grader may not necessarily be the right sentence frame for an eighth grader. Um But just showing them that structure can get them built building the habit of answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions. The next thing is sentence starters. And so this is a little bit different from uh a sentence frame rather than them uh or rather than the students like filling in the gaps, the sentence starters will start the sentence, but then the students have to fill in all of the rest of the information. So really, this is ideal for all students. Um but if you have students really operating at that very, very low level, uh they might need a little bit more progression. So, um think about, uh you know, think about your students who continually tell you things like, I don't know how to start. I'm not sure how to, to get this going or I'm not sure what to say at this point. Um You know, sentence uh starters can be a really, really good uh choice for them. Um text evidence, which I've got linked in here is a great place for us to start with sentence starters because that comes up so often not only in the standards and in the state tests, but really uh you know, think about all of the times in core where we see questions where it's like use text evidence and then think about in high school and college when you have to provide evidence of where you got your answer. So text evidence, the sooner you start that the more beneficial it's going to be for your students. So I've linked in my text evidence, sentence starters sheet. This is a really simple document um that just provides a lot of different examples of how you can start off a sentence that you need to provide some text evidence for. So one thing that could be really helpful for your students is sending this to them and having them printed off or if you've got a printer, printing it for them, but whatever the case may be so that they've got it kind of handy and they can refer to it whenever they're going to be writing. Now, keep in mind also, this can be helpful in core curriculum when they're answering open ended text evidence questions. It's really great when they're doing test prep because there's going to be those text evidence type and uh questions on the state test. And also when you get ready to start teaching like informational writing or argumentative writing, this can be implemented in the essays as well. So this is helpful on a lot of different levels. And as you can see, there are quite a few of them uh to choose from. So, you know, you can let your students kind of play around with that and try different techniques until they find one that really feels comfortable for them. Alrighty. And our last sentence building technique is checking for complete sentences. Now, this one is probably the most sophisticated I would say because they actually need to be, you know, kind of taking it to that next level of, of understanding of knowledge. Um So you can use a sample um you know, whether it's off of no red ink as an example or the State department's writing section or their own work, you can practice with your students checking for complete sentences. So really if you break it down to its simplest level. Uh a complete sentence needs three things. You have to have that capital letter at the beginning. You have to have in punctuation and you have to have at least one independent clause with a subject and a verb. And obviously sentences can get more sophisticated as they go on. But those are the basics. So, and remember we're, we're starting where kids are OK. Um And keep in mind also that if your students have that, that basic misunderstanding of the grammar itself, you can take that back into practice, um maybe give them some of the basics once again. Um Just to make sure that those, those concepts are cemented in their mind before you are having them check their own work. Now, one other thing is checking for complete sentences is a part of the writers checklist. Um So if you've got fifth or eighth graders, when they head into the um the test, you know, the state test at the end of the year, they will be given a copy of the writer's checklist. And if you practice using that writer's checklist with your students throughout the year, they're gonna feel more comfortable using it by themselves when they're taking the test. So just keep that in mind that that is a pretty handy test, taking tip as you are prepping for that season of life. So next thing is I'm gonna turn on my, actually turn on one of my poles. Um And it's the after sentence section question. Which technique do you think? Um there it's been shared? OK. Which technique do you think, did that pop up for you guys? Because it's saying that it has been shared? Yeah, it is. OK. Good. All right. Which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? And then go ahead and let's see. Is it gonna let me launch it? Hm. It's just showing on your shared screen? Yeah, I think it's stop sharing. Ah OK. Thank you very much. Now, it's still uh not letting me launch it. OK. So in the chat, uh just tell me which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? Whether it's sentence frames, checking for complete sentences or sentence starters? I'm liking all the people saying all of them. That's really awesome. Sentence starters are another really great one that's just pretty much grab and go, you know, because it's very easy to implement in a very short demonstration with your students. Practice it a few times and then they're able to start taking it, you know, into what they're working on. OK. Well, I'm going to go ahead and share screen once more and head back to the presentation and we're heading into paragraphs at this point. So quick overview of what we're gonna talk about with paragraphs, paragraph frames similar to sentence frames and we're gonna move it a little bit deeper into our understanding of using text evidence with the race strategy. So moving into paragraph frames, um these are students who have mastered complete sentences and they're ready for building paragraphs. Um And in a lot of ways, uh building paragraphs is honestly easier. Once, you know, students, it seems like some students struggle with the basic building blocks of sentences, but building paragraphs can be simpler for them. I, I'm not sure what the, what the psychology is of that. But uh it's just anecdotally from my uh my use of paragraphs with students, it seems like once they've grasped sentences, paragraphs as a building block bigger than sentences is just really simple to grasp. So they're very helpful when you're teaching different types of paragraphs. Um So if you're teaching the structure of different kinds of paragraphs, like narrative, uh description, compare and contrast using a paragraph frame can help them understand like what are you envisioning? And I, I think with writing especially because it is so creative and it is so grounded in expression. Sometimes having a visual of what it can look like shows students what they're capable of. And just fy i another kind of test taking tip just because that's on all of our minds. Um The Oklahoma State Department of Ed website, they have a whole writing section that has student examples. So you can see good student examples, poor student examples. I think these are really helpful to show students because it shows them this is what a person your age most likely can produce. Um Some kids really get anxiety about those things because uh they feel almost like imposter syndrome, you know, like, oh I'm not a good writer, you know, and they can see you're probably a better writer than you think you are. But going back to paragraph frames, um the race paragraph frame that we're gonna talk about next perfect for text evidence. But other types of paragraph frames like I've talked about before, narrative, informational, descriptive and so on. And I included a link to a scholastic uh assignment um that really builds out a lot of really cool paragraph frames. Um So keep in mind also that showing your students how to use paragraph frames once again, can be really helpful for those state test. Uh open ended questions and again, you're not creating more work for them. You're just instilling the expectation that they will answer, you know, open ended questions with complete sentences and paragraphs when the situation calls for it. So as an example, if you get a question in bright thinker that says, what were the three causes for the election of Teddy Roosevelt, you know, in or a social studies class, then your student would obviously need to organize a paragraph that incorporates those three reasons. So, you know, just kind of building that expectation doesn't create more work um for either you or the student, it just increases the expectation. So if you have students who kind of struggle with writing because they feel like it's more work, these techniques that we're talking about can really help alleviate that because it, it becomes a habit. You know, you do it instinctively as an example. Yesterday, I was uh talking with my no red ink, uh support people and one is older than me and the other one is younger than me. And I, I joked with them and I said, hey, have you guys adjusted to saying 2023 in your writing yet? And the, the younger person said I still am writing 2022. But my handwriting is so terrible that it doesn't matter. And I said, you know, as an elder millennial, I think I might be the last person that was taught to write everything in cursive and very neatly after that, I feel like all, all the teachers at my school just were like, ah, forget about it. Um, so with that being said, you know, um, for me at that being of that age, um, cursive writing is just a habit. I don't even have to think about it. But even somebody who's like, five years younger than me cursive can be something that they have to think about because they didn't practice it so much. And writing is exactly the same way. Um, for all of us who, you know, we've worked through Bachelor's degrees. Most of us have worked through master's degrees. Some of you rock stars out there are working on phd s like it doesn't take any effort to be able to produce a lot of writing and very quickly and very professionally, but you have to scale back your expectation. You know, think about your students and think about where they are and even maybe picture yourself when you were that age and what you were capable of doing. So just bear in mind. Uh you know, once you start building those habits, it really takes off, but sometimes building the habit in the first place can be the hard part. So next, we're gonna talk about the race strategy. So race just stands for restate the question answer the question, cite text evidence and explain. OK. So it's super, super applicable for a lot of different types of open ended questions where you're having to explain your answer c text evidence. If it has any of that kind of lingo in the question, your students can use this strategy. And once again building that habit, once you've done it for a few days or weeks, it just becomes instinctive to use the lingo that you've created with your text evidence, starters and to follow this strategy, I also linked in here, uh a link for further reading. So keep in mind that you've, you've got that available to you. Um And we're gonna just go through the steps of the strategy. So restating the question, this is one that you know, it relates. So um so well to student success, when they need to write a complete sentence, if you just restate the question and use the language of the question in your answer, uh Half the battle of writing a complete sentence is over, you know, um it's all there in the question. So you remove the question word from the question and write it as a statement. So this itself restating the question as a sentence that could be an activity that you practice with your students. So an example would be who was responsible for the broken vase. Like they're reading a story about, you know, some kids who broke a vase. Um You could reply in your answer, Jennifer was responsible for the broken vase. So you've taken out the question word of who and you've put your answer in there and you've got a sentence, it's that easy, then you're going to answer the question. So you restate and answer the question that can happen in the same sentence. But it's crucial to make sure that the entire question is answered. So the technique that you can take into this with your students is have them like underline or point to or circle or highlight whatever you want the words in the sentence that are, you know, basically showing them what's being asked. And if you think about it, that's an important technique that translates across curricular or cross subject areas. You know, think about reading a word problem in math and how you have to break down what's actually being asked of you in that word problem so that you don't accidentally do it opposite of how you're supposed to for the word problem. The same thing is true in el A or an opened in science question or social studies, make sure that the entire question is answered. And once again, it's a habit so that students, you know, slow down and read thoroughly. Next is citing text evidence. We talked about this previously with sentence starters. So again, we're building on what we've done in the previous section and bringing it into a paragraph and to go along with that for the explained portion where they explain how their text evidence supports their answer. Um I have a document for explanation, sentence starters to help them. And so, you know, if you think about writing as being a progression, you know, when you pick up habits and tools at the sentence level, it doesn't mean that you abandon them when you get to the paragraph level. Here's two places where you're actually using those uh those sentence starters to help you write a really great paragraph. And also keep in mind when you're talking to your students about the expectation of writing with complete sentences and creating paragraphs to open ended questions. You can do that with science, you can do it with social studies, you can do it with El A and just every time they're doing that they are writing and they are adding to their habit of writing. So then when you know, they move up to the next grade or when they have to answer a constructive response on the state test or they have to write essays or whatever the case may be, they're going to be ready for it. So these are pretty powerful tools that your students can apply towards their own learning and understanding. So our next section is graphic organizers. All righty. Now, graphic organizers are one of my favorite things about El A. Um Once again, can be applied to a lot of different situations in El A and it can go cross curricular with science and social studies as well. So bear in mind that these kinds of graphic organizers we're looking at, you might be showing them to your students in a lot of different areas. Um Keep in mind also. And I think I talk about this a little bit later in the slides too, but I wanted to reiterate it now when your students go into the testing room. All right. All of the, the comforts of home are stripped away. They are in an unfamiliar place. They're sitting in a group of students that they don't know, probably um they might have AAA test administrator that they don't know. And so test anxiety is a real thing. And it can be, uh, kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know, and it's hard, it's hard to remember what it's like when you're a little kid, um, when you've, you know, gone decades and years way beyond that. But if you teach your students how to use things, like taking notes, graphic organizers using scratch paper when they're, you know, working online, they can take those habits into the testing room with them. All right. And so this example that I'm gonna show you um on the next slide is one of those really good graphic organizers that if you practice that with your students, they can have that visual picture in their mind as they're going into the test room. So when they encounter, you know, a question about like what's the main idea of this passage? They could jot that graphic organizer down and fill it in with the passage that they just read and they're gonna feel successful, you know, they're gonna feel capable and they're gonna know that they can answer those questions with, you know, 100% correctness because they've got that visual in front of them to help them. So remember, graphic organizers really helpful to help your students recall what they do know. Um So just to talk about graphic organizers in general, they help us track info. And for you as the teacher, they can also help see where your students have gaps in their information. So for instance, if your student is filling out this main ide graphic organizer and they, they know the main idea right there, like they read the passage and they were like, this is the main idea and you're thinking, oh, but what if you have to provide text evidence and a question about that, you know, where are you going to be able to show me that that is in the passage? That's when you can say, let's take this a step back and actually look for the supporting details because you're right, you found the main idea, but I need to see more. I need to know more about what you're doing. Um So graphic organizers can be really helpful in that regard for the teacher as well. They make a nice visual representation for written responses. Um I love outlines. I find them to be very, very helpful. Um not only as a writer myself but also for students because it shows them sort of almost like a checklist, you know, like first in my introduction, I'm going to write about this and then, oh yeah, I forgot I need to put in my thesis statement and I need to make sure that I've done a hook of some sort to pull my reader in. Um you know, then it makes body paragraphs very, very quick and easy to put together. So outlines and graphic organizers kind of go hand in hand in being super helpful for getting our writing organized. Now, in contrast to sentence and paragraph frames. Um graphic organizers allow for a lot more fluidity. You know, it's more about the planning and the creativity rather than having um sort of the answer built, you know what I'm saying? Um At this point with a graphic organizer, like there's still that scaffolding that's happening with the graphic organizer. But it is also allowing us to, you know, give more freedom to our students, which I did notice on our jam board, some people wrote freedom of expression. You know, when we're talking about a sentence frame, there's very little uh freedom of expression. Then when you move into graphic organizers, like a brainstorm as an example, that's when you really get to see students, let it go and, and have a lot of fun with the creativity that they're having. And remember once again, reiterating that the more we practice using graphic organizers, the better our students will remember them and be able to use them when they go into the testing room. So I was going to uh like actually go through a sample text and provide a sa uh a sample question where we could break down this graphic organizer. But I think in the name of, of time and respecting the time that we have left, um you know, I will kind of give you the gist of the text and then the sample question will make more sense. Um Basically, the sample text uh is about, you know, light disruption. When people have a lot of lights on, on the coastline in Florida, it can cause sea turtle hatchlings to get kind of disoriented. Instead of going towards the sea, they turn and go inland. So basically, they're trying to uh you know, during the the hatching season, they're trying to get people to turn their lights off a little bit more during those hours when they know the turtles are going to be hatching. So kind of cool. Anyway, um moving on into constructive responses, which we've been talking about quite a bit um with open ended questioning, but we're gonna go more in depth with that here. So basically, a constructed response is any kind of open ended question um that goes beyond the yes or no. And they're wanting you to build a response usually centered around text evidence. Um Now, keep in mind uh that's where you're incorporating things like sentence starters and paragraph frames. Um You have a combination of both of those techniques when you're putting together a constructed response and you also have that prompt. Um Think back to when we were talking about using the language of the question in your answer. I if you do that, usually the people who score constructed responses, uh you know, they kind of have a, a rubric or, or some metrics that they're hoping writers are hitting. And so using the language of the question, you're incorporating the vocab that they're looking for. So for instance, if the question says infer and your student also puts infer into their sentence, then, you know, that kind of is like a point in their favor automatically because they're using that lingo um getting students used to making constructive responses helps in a lot of different ways. Um First off, you can build really big paragraphs um just by following like the basic steps of constructive responses. So the example that I previously gave was something like, you know, name three reasons. So that constructed response, it already has three reasons built in. So each one of those reasons is gonna get its own sentence. All right, then you have sort of an opening statement uh where you reflect the language of the question, you have your three reasons and then you have your concluding sentence that explains your answer. So right there, right off the bat, you have a five sentence paragraph. So your student who maybe a few weeks ago was like, I don't know how to write paragraphs or I don't know how to write sentences or they don't even tell you that they don't know how to write those things. They just answer ID K, you know, you can leave them in a very short amount of time from being not a writer to being able to write a paragraph and a pretty big paragraph to boot inferences also become a lot easier. Um especially when students get into the habit of using the language of the question in their answer. Um They're kind of picking up on the hint that is being provided to them in the question. So I think that that's one of the things kids struggle a lot with. When they read a question, they don't really slow down and think. All right, when they're asking me to infer, they're basically saying, make an educated guess. Um And then I have to provide it where I got that, you know, inspiration for that educated guess. All right, so you kind of do that breakdown, like when you're building the question into an answer, you're thinking about what they're really asking of us. So it kind of takes it from just sort of superficially reading the question and makes it more of an in depth active reading activity, but all in a very short amount of time as well. Um And like I say, at the end that then allows it to be in easier to introduce greater depth of knowledge because they're going through those mental steps of reading the question, transferring it into the beginning of their answer and then going into the text to find their answer and then explaining how it supports their inference or their answer, whatever the case may be. So as they go through that process of writing, their reading techniques become better, so pretty powerful stuff. Um a few weeks, well, actually, I think it was longer ago Lauren asked me to provide some research that was about writing and its impact on reading. And I had a, I had always known this as a reader and a writer and as a teacher of those things, but like, actually reading the evidence that supports that they're so symbiotic if you want to be a better reader, be a better writer. And if you wanna write, you need to read, I mean, they, they are so tied together, you know, it's amazing. I it was actually a really fun. Uh couple of hours of research, I really enjoyed it. But anyway, with that being said, now we're gonna move into using an actual supplemental um where you can add some activities to your students uh workload, but in a very, very um easy to handle manner. OK. So the next thing we're gonna talk about is quick rights with no red ink. All right. So first off, these are students or these are ideal for students at any level of mastery. Um No, writing has a lot of different quick rights that are related to skills. So if you've got those students who are needing that practice, like at the grammatical level of sentence construction, uh you've got some quick rights that you can give them if you've got students who have more of a creative writing bend. Um They have quick rights for that if you want to tie it to text evidence, um they have literary analysis quick rights. And if you've got students who are just kind of reluctant, like they just are struggling. Um One thing that I think would be fantastic to do with a student is to actually go into the quick rights, which are linked right here and show them some of the options and then ask them to choose which ones they would like to write about. You know, it's all about expression. So let them have, you know, the, the the agency to pick their own. So they have featured. And when you click into that, you can see a lot of different options over here on the side. If you've got students who are maybe pretty low level uh readers or they're really struggling with, you know, the whole writing thing to begin with. Try some of these like for fun, um different kinds of prompts, like picture prompts. I was talking with the narrating people yesterday and I said, you know, I feel like the picture prompts would be really great for, you know, either kids who are in grade level, but they are working below grade level if you've got ell students, because it's got that visual element that could be really fun if, if you've got younger students. So picture prompts would be really great for that. And you also have science and social studies so you can bring in that cross curricular work. Uh You also have just for fun activities and then you also have literary ones as well. So, going through that with your students and just having them pick a few would be such a great practice for them. Um, first off, it lets them have some fun picking out the assignments, but then it also, um, gives them some writing activities to do as well. So back to what quick writes are, um, just in general, they are intended to take about 5 to 10 minutes to write. So no more so than AAA good sized paragraph after you've, you know, kind of developed what a paragraph is, what goes into it and all that good stuff. Um Like I said before and like we've seen, they have a lot of different topics to help engage students and it can be as rigorous or as unstructured as you need it to be. So, you know, I'm a big fan of not making things harder for teachers or students, uh you know, by in the sense of like not giving them busy work. OK. So quick rights are pretty easy to incorporate in a very quick way that doesn't like totally upend your day. So here's an example, the soundtrack of your life. Um The prompt is pretty fun. If you could create a soundtrack for your life, what songs would you include and why? Um And let's say I wanna go ahead and assign that to my students. So when I look at the assignment page, I can add or subtract to this uh prompt as much as I want to like, if you wanted to make a whole soundtrack, think about how many songs that would be like 10 or 15 songs, you know, but they have it set to just two, which is pretty manageable for students, I think. But let's say that you have somebody who's really struggling, um you might lower it down to just a single song. Like what song sort of is you, you know, you can also adjust the link like if you wanted to make it a true, like in depth creative writing, you know, assignment and you wanted it to be an entire soundtrack. Like you could make it into a full essay type of writing, you know, but keeping it just at a paragraph that kind of keeps it in the time frame of just 5 to 10 minutes and then you can make it super easy on yourself too. From a grading standpoint, it can be automatic based on word count. They get to that 75 word count and it will automatically register as a 100 if you want to have a little bit of control over, you know, like what exactly are they saying? Are they practicing complete sentences? Are they practicing, you know, good paragraph construction. I'm gonna assign a 0 to 100% grade. You can set it to that too. You can also grade it on a rubric. So if you wanted to expand that into a complete essay. You know, you could grade it on a rubric and then just apply, you know, like the rubric that is provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Whatever the case may be, you can go up or down in terms of how strict or rigorous you want this to be. You can also add focus areas. So these are ways that you can cue your students to what you're going to be grading on and reminding them. We want complete sentences. We want to make sure that we are hitting the word count and you wanna make sure that you're discussing at least two songs, you know, just reinforcing what the prompt is asking you for. So, and you can see. So I had it set for 375 words and noticed that it expanded that to be, you know, about an hour for them to write. And then when I lower it back down to one paragraph, it drops it down to 10 to 15 minutes. So remember there's a, a sliding scale of how much work it can take to produce an assignment for your students. So quick writes. Pretty awesome things going back into our presentation. Um One last thing about quick writes, just keep in mind that you can use them for a lot of different reasons. They can be for fun, creative writing, um just getting the thought process going, they can help your students build on specific skills and they can help your students understand constructed responses. So they're pretty fantastic things in, in general. All righty. So now we're gonna start wrapping it up. We're gonna talk back about those icann statements. So we're gonna be returning to our jam board. All right. So if you've still got that, I'm gonna drop that into the chat one more time. All righty. So we're actually gonna go, go over to the second slide. Um Think about our different uh icann statements. The first one was I can utilize stu tools to get my students writing at their current level. I can put resources I gather today to use in building a daily writing habit for my students and I can support my students as they advance into higher writing skills. So on a scale from 1 to 10, um just you can stick it or you can put a text box or whatever the case may be uh on a scale from 1 to 10. How do you feel about the icann statements at this point? Nice. All right. It seems like people are feeling pretty good about it um that they, they can take at least one thing from today's presentation and be able to apply it in their daily work with their students. That's awesome to see. All right. Now, you guys can go ahead and continue to add your responses to the I can statements. I'm gonna take it back to the presentation for myself. Um I think I actually answered or used all my poll questions that I needed to, um, especially since it wouldn't pop up after the first one. So at this point, we've got some time to ask any questions that anyone has. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and we're just gonna talk as a group. Um Any questions that anyone has at this point? Are you all feeling good or are you all feeling shy? Ok, I'm seeing some responses. That's good. Awesome. I am really glad to hear it. Um First off, um, before I give you guys the, the survey and the concluding uh slide and wrap things up, I just want to give you guys a shout out for attending during the noon hour. I like this time because I know a lot of people take their lunch at this point and that means I have a better chance of catching you. But I also know that that means you're dedicating some of your, your personal time during the day to listening to me talk and I thank you so much. I appreciate that very, very much. Um Other things. Next month we have a PLC season gearing up and the instructional coaches, we have put together a really awesome presentation. So if you have a chance to attend A PLC where we're going to be presenting, um That's awesome. And I can't wait to see you guys if you um if your MD I is going in a different direction, which is also cool. I know that they've got some really cool things uh that they're, you know, developing for next month. But if you wanna see that presentation, feel free to reach out to either your principal and say, hey, why don't we have this as a team meeting kind of thing? Or you can reach out to the I CS through our office hours and um you know, we can give you the rundown like in a one on one session. Speaking of office hours, one on one sessions with me cover a whole lot of different topics. I support no red ink obviously because we talked about it today near pod um vocabulary. I'm also over sora. So if you ever have any books that you wanna see in the library and you want, you know, to get in on that or talk about novel studies or anything like that, you come to me and I can also talk with you about el a strategies planning uh helping your kids do better on formative, whatever the case may be. I am here to talk to you. So uh you can access all of those links on Epic One. And uh I think that that just about covers it. So I'm gonna share my screen one more time and take us over to the presentation so you guys can uh do your exit survey and I will also drop that link in to the chat if you don't want to mess with Q codes. There we go. All righty and Betsy, I think you have a, can you shut off recording too? I think at this point, I think we're good to turn off the recording.\"), (2064, 626, 3881, \"Joining. All righty. So first off, um you know, as people are getting set up and into the meeting and everything, um there is the QR code reader for Google Chrome extension which allows QR codes to be accessed or accessed from your computer. Um So if you, you know, don't typically sign into your epic email on your phone, uh you have the ability to access the survey from the QR code on your computer as well. And we will also drop the survey link into the chat when the presentation is concluded and we are working today on the presentation building a daily writing habit. I know that that can be a really difficult um habit to establish for our, our students, especially if they're coming from a, a standpoint where they have not been doing a lot of writing. Um It's, it's very similar to any kind of other endurance activity like running a marathon or, you know, taking long road trips or whatever the case may be learning how to paint. You know, you can't go from not doing the activity to all of a sudden being able to, you know, just produce a, a ton of different product in regards to writing or any other kind of creative effort. So we're going to talk about meeting kids where they are and building those habits into bigger and better habits as they go along. So, um remember also that this is a focus on grades five through eight. Some of these activities can definitely be scaled down for younger students and they can be scaled up for older students as well. So it there is that um kind of limiter of grades five through eight, that's where I'm particularly focused on at this point. But remember that you can apply it to students wherever they are at. So first off, we're going to start with some icann statements. Now, these are goals uh that I have set for us as a group. Um By the end of the training, we should all be able to utilize the tools that we're going to discuss in this hour so that we can get students writing at their current level. Um And you should be able to uh by the end of the hour, put resources that I've gathered together um to use in building a daily writing habit for your students, whether your students are writing at the sentence level, whether they are ready for paragraphs or whether they're ready to go on from there. And of course, the most important one that we will be able to support our students as they advance into higher writing skills So our next uh next activity is the jam board. What is writing? So if you can uh go ahead and click that link, if you have the presentation up and I will drop the link directly into the chat, just go ahead and drop a sticky so that you can see or so you can say what is writing exactly. All right, what is it to you? And we will take a couple of minutes to see those responses and talk about them a little bit. And it's OK to say, I, you know, have a very traditional standpoint of what writing is. Uh You could also say that, you know, you could talk about it in a philosophical sense as well. So it doesn't show any options for stickies or anything like yours does weird. Let me see if I can change this. Oh, it says view only. That's what it is. That's what it is. Thank you for speaking up. All righty. If you would press refresh, you will now have the option to comment. I have the link again too when I came in. I think it had already been sent. Absolutely. So for those of us who are coming in a little bit later, we're talking about what writing is, what it can be for our students, how our students can uh can be writers, you know, um does writing simply mean that you've reached sort of the end goal of publishing a book, does it mean that you write on the daily? Does it mean that you are a capable communicator? I'm seeing some really wonderful um expression. That's a very big one, explaining your brain, putting thoughts on paper. OK. This is wonderful. I'm loving what you guys are seeing or saying and this is all very true. All right. So when we talk about writing, sometimes we have a very formal concept in our mind of what writing is, um that it has to be sort of like, it must be essays or it must be, you know, like publishing a book or publishing an academic paper. And those are certainly long term goals for a lot of people, especially if they um move into, you know, college education where they want to focus on getting published, uh, you know, as an academic writer, but it can be something as, as personal as keeping a daily journal. Um I'm a daily journal person. I have been keeping a journal since I was in middle school. And for me, it's a very therapeutic process. And in all honesty, I wouldn't have found that pathway as a person, if not for having good writing skills to begin with. So I really have to be thankful for my, my teachers in upper elementary and middle school for instilling those habits in me so that I could then transfer, transfer it into personal expression. And the same thing is true for a lot of students who are looking for a creative outlet. Um Creative writing is a wonderful uh pathway for expression for our students. So the thing is writing can be a lot of different things and that's not even touching on things like college and career readiness where you think about all the different forms of communication that technically are writing, think about filling out an application, writing an email to a professor. Um you know, being able to prepare some good interview answers when you know that you're going to be interviewed for like a President's leadership class or something like that. Um All of those things are writing, even if they don't necessarily take the form of, you know, typing or putting pen to paper. Um Another element is, you know, public speaking, um being able to discuss things in a well thought out manner in class, you know, all of those, those activities rely on writing skills, even if we don't necessarily say this is a writing skill. So I think you guys are in a really great place to understand what we're gonna be talking about here, sort of what the long term goal is with encouraging writing for our students and just realizing that the activities we talk about today, they are starting points, but there's really no end for how far your students can go with writing. So we're gonna head back to the presentation at this point and we're gonna talk a little bit about our agenda for the day. So we're gonna talk about the importance of daily writing. And I think, I think everyone's on the same page with that, which is awesome to see. Then we're gonna talk about um techniques we can use to build uh skills where our, our students are struggling with sentences. Uh Then we'll move into paragraphs, graphic organizers, constructed responses and quick rights. So you can kind of see that it starts at that very basic level of sentences and it builds from there. So next is the importance of writing. So like a lot of you, I am in, I'm working through letters training at the moment. And um the thing about it is uh the importance of writing is that, you know, every teacher in every grade starting in kindergarten should teach sentence building and sentence writing activities and sometimes that gets neglected um because we focus on other things or because um there might be other difficulties that our students are encountering. There can be a lot of barriers to instilling those writing habits in those very early years. But writing activities improve students, grammar and reading skills and vice versa. Writing gives your students also the power of expression and this is vital to their sense of self and future development. So really quickly, I'm gonna, I'm gonna launch a poll um for all of you uh just asking basically how often and this, if you're not a teacher, no problem. Um That's not a worry but just how often are your students writing on a regular basis? Let's see. Where are my poles? Mm. That's interesting because I set them up. Alrighty, maybe I need to stop chair for a second. I will stop here for a second and see if that allows me to set. There's my pole. All right. So the question is how often do your students write? And it, you know, there's no shame if it's rarely, there's no shame if it is on a monthly basis. Obviously, we wanna try to get it going where it is a daily kind of activity for our students. Um But this is an honest and open communication at this point. So think about where your students are at right now. All righty and I'll give it another few seconds and then we'll end the poll and show results. OK? So as you guys can see from that, um a lot of our students are writing on a weekly basis, which is great. That's a wonderful place to start. Um And you might be envisioning like when I say, how often are your students writing? You might be actually thinking more of like extended writing as opposed to, you know, smaller pieces of writing. So keep in mind also that the, you know, the all kinds of writing count in terms of this uh question. All righty. So with that being said, I'm gonna share screen once again and head back to my presentation. Now, the next thing we're gonna talk about is sentence building. All right. And just to give you an overview of what we're going to be looking at specifically with sent sentence building. We're gonna talk about sentence frames, sentence starters and checking for complete sentences. So keep in mind uh if your student has like a critical misunderstanding of the parts of a sentence, then that means you probably need to walk it back and give them some grammar remediation. So like take it back to that concept of like parts of speech and show them how the pieces of sentences can fit together to make independent clauses and dependent clauses. Um However, with that being said, um we're just focusing on the actual crafting of sentences. So bear in mind, you can like I said, scale it back or up as you need to for your students. So starting with sentence frames. OK. So you might be asking what is a sentence frame and it's a preconstructed frame that allows your student to fill in the gaps. So this would be useful for students who are really just getting started. Um This is very guided writing. Um It also allows your students to help build their response faster. So if you have a student who really is struggling or they feel like they're taking too long, sometimes providing them with a sentence frame to help them formulate, the answer can be really, really helpful. And another place where you can instill that practice very quickly. So imagine that you are meeting one on one with that student and you show them how to use a sentence frame, then they might be able to use that sentence frame as they are completing open ended questions in a core curriculum. So as an example, if you give them like if it's a question that says, what is your opinion about blank? You could use a sentence frame that shows them to say, I think that this is and then they put their opinion right in there. So instead of students having that instinct to just say, you know, like, oh, I guess the book was terrible. You know, they're formulating in it into a more complete thought um that reflects the language of the question. So that's a really great way that you can show them the technique and then apply it into the work that they're already doing. So you're not creating more work for them, you're just showing them how they can be more effective in building up some writing practice in their core. So next, we're gonna look at a few examples of um sentence frames and these are actually kind of cross curricular to be honest, there's a few question or a few frames that refer to um math concepts and science. And I also included the source for those examples. So you can, you know, dive in and apply those as, as you would like. So here are some examples and you can see that these really start very low level. OK. So very easily scaled down to kindergarten, first grade level and very easy to, to adjust if you have a student who is, you know, in middle school, but performing lower and you can see that it can be um you know, pretty extensive and you're bringing in some of that academic vocabulary where it says like based on the experiment, I can infer that the blank will increase and the blank will decrease. Um you can restructure that and adjust it. And the nice thing about it is inference is found in social studies and el A. So teaching your student a sentence frame that talks about inference, they could imply they could apply that to multiple subject areas. And obviously, every situation is going to be a little bit different. Um you know, a sentence frame that works for 1/4 grader may not necessarily be the right sentence frame for an eighth grader. Um But just showing them that structure can get them built building the habit of answering with complete sentences when they're asked open ended questions. The next thing is sentence starters. And so this is a little bit different from uh a sentence frame rather than them uh or rather than the students like filling in the gaps, the sentence starters will start the sentence, but then the students have to fill in all of the rest of the information. So really, this is ideal for all students. Um but if you have students really operating at that very, very low level, uh they might need a little bit more progression. So, um think about, uh you know, think about your students who continually tell you things like, I don't know how to start. I'm not sure how to, to get this going or I'm not sure what to say at this point. Um You know, sentence uh starters can be a really, really good uh choice for them. Um text evidence, which I've got linked in here is a great place for us to start with sentence starters because that comes up so often not only in the standards and in the state tests, but really uh you know, think about all of the times in core where we see questions where it's like use text evidence and then think about in high school and college when you have to provide evidence of where you got your answer. So text evidence, the sooner you start that the more beneficial it's going to be for your students. So I've linked in my text evidence, sentence starters sheet. This is a really simple document um that just provides a lot of different examples of how you can start off a sentence that you need to provide some text evidence for. So one thing that could be really helpful for your students is sending this to them and having them printed off or if you've got a printer, printing it for them, but whatever the case may be so that they've got it kind of handy and they can refer to it whenever they're going to be writing. Now, keep in mind also, this can be helpful in core curriculum when they're answering open ended text evidence questions. It's really great when they're doing test prep because there's going to be those text evidence type and uh questions on the state test. And also when you get ready to start teaching like informational writing or argumentative writing, this can be implemented in the essays as well. So this is helpful on a lot of different levels. And as you can see, there are quite a few of them uh to choose from. So, you know, you can let your students kind of play around with that and try different techniques until they find one that really feels comfortable for them. Alrighty. And our last sentence building technique is checking for complete sentences. Now, this one is probably the most sophisticated I would say because they actually need to be, you know, kind of taking it to that next level of, of understanding of knowledge. Um So you can use a sample um you know, whether it's off of no red ink as an example or the State department's writing section or their own work, you can practice with your students checking for complete sentences. So really if you break it down to its simplest level. Uh a complete sentence needs three things. You have to have that capital letter at the beginning. You have to have in punctuation and you have to have at least one independent clause with a subject and a verb. And obviously sentences can get more sophisticated as they go on. But those are the basics. So, and remember we're, we're starting where kids are OK. Um And keep in mind also that if your students have that, that basic misunderstanding of the grammar itself, you can take that back into practice, um maybe give them some of the basics once again. Um Just to make sure that those, those concepts are cemented in their mind before you are having them check their own work. Now, one other thing is checking for complete sentences is a part of the writers checklist. Um So if you've got fifth or eighth graders, when they head into the um the test, you know, the state test at the end of the year, they will be given a copy of the writer's checklist. And if you practice using that writer's checklist with your students throughout the year, they're gonna feel more comfortable using it by themselves when they're taking the test. So just keep that in mind that that is a pretty handy test, taking tip as you are prepping for that season of life. So next thing is I'm gonna turn on my, actually turn on one of my poles. Um And it's the after sentence section question. Which technique do you think? Um there it's been shared? OK. Which technique do you think, did that pop up for you guys? Because it's saying that it has been shared? Yeah, it is. OK. Good. All right. Which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? And then go ahead and let's see. Is it gonna let me launch it? Hm. It's just showing on your shared screen? Yeah, I think it's stop sharing. Ah OK. Thank you very much. Now, it's still uh not letting me launch it. OK. So in the chat, uh just tell me which technique do you think you can take immediately into your work with students? Whether it's sentence frames, checking for complete sentences or sentence starters? I'm liking all the people saying all of them. That's really awesome. Sentence starters are another really great one that's just pretty much grab and go, you know, because it's very easy to implement in a very short demonstration with your students. Practice it a few times and then they're able to start taking it, you know, into what they're working on. OK. Well, I'm going to go ahead and share screen once more and head back to the presentation and we're heading into paragraphs at this point. So quick overview of what we're gonna talk about with paragraphs, paragraph frames similar to sentence frames and we're gonna move it a little bit deeper into our understanding of using text evidence with the race strategy. So moving into paragraph frames, um these are students who have mastered complete sentences and they're ready for building paragraphs. Um And in a lot of ways, uh building paragraphs is honestly easier. Once, you know, students, it seems like some students struggle with the basic building blocks of sentences, but building paragraphs can be simpler for them. I, I'm not sure what the, what the psychology is of that. But uh it's just anecdotally from my uh my use of paragraphs with students, it seems like once they've grasped sentences, paragraphs as a building block bigger than sentences is just really simple to grasp. So they're very helpful when you're teaching different types of paragraphs. Um So if you're teaching the structure of different kinds of paragraphs, like narrative, uh description, compare and contrast using a paragraph frame can help them understand like what are you envisioning? And I, I think with writing especially because it is so creative and it is so grounded in expression. Sometimes having a visual of what it can look like shows students what they're capable of. And just fy i another kind of test taking tip just because that's on all of our minds. Um The Oklahoma State Department of Ed website, they have a whole writing section that has student examples. So you can see good student examples, poor student examples. I think these are really helpful to show students because it shows them this is what a person your age most likely can produce. Um Some kids really get anxiety about those things because uh they feel almost like imposter syndrome, you know, like, oh I'm not a good writer, you know, and they can see you're probably a better writer than you think you are. But going back to paragraph frames, um the race paragraph frame that we're gonna talk about next perfect for text evidence. But other types of paragraph frames like I've talked about before, narrative, informational, descriptive and so on. And I included a link to a scholastic uh assignment um that really builds out a lot of really cool paragraph frames. Um So keep in mind also that showing your students how to use paragraph frames once again, can be really helpful for those state test. Uh open ended questions and again, you're not creating more work for them. You're just instilling the expectation that they will answer, you know, open ended questions with complete sentences and paragraphs when the situation calls for it. So as an example, if you get a question in bright thinker that says, what were the three causes for the election of Teddy Roosevelt, you know, in or a social studies class, then your student would obviously need to organize a paragraph that incorporates those three reasons. So, you know, just kind of building that expectation doesn't create more work um for either you or the student, it just increases the expectation. So if you have students who kind of struggle with writing because they feel like it's more work, these techniques that we're talking about can really help alleviate that because it, it becomes a habit. You know, you do it instinctively as an example. Yesterday, I was uh talking with my no red ink, uh support people and one is older than me and the other one is younger than me. And I, I joked with them and I said, hey, have you guys adjusted to saying 2023 in your writing yet? And the, the younger person said I still am writing 2022. But my handwriting is so terrible that it doesn't matter. And I said, you know, as an elder millennial, I think I might be the last person that was taught to write everything in cursive and very neatly after that, I feel like all, all the teachers at my school just were like, ah, forget about it. Um, so with that being said, you know, um, for me at that being of that age, um, cursive writing is just a habit. I don't even have to think about it. But even somebody who's like, five years younger than me cursive can be something that they have to think about because they didn't practice it so much. And writing is exactly the same way. Um, for all of us who, you know, we've worked through Bachelor's degrees. Most of us have worked through master's degrees. Some of you rock stars out there are working on phd s like it doesn't take any effort to be able to produce a lot of writing and very quickly and very professionally, but you have to scale back your expectation. You know, think about your students and think about where they are and even maybe picture yourself when you were that age and what you were capable of doing. So just bear in mind. Uh you know, once you start building those habits, it really takes off, but sometimes building the habit in the first place can be the hard part. So next, we're gonna talk about the race strategy. So race just stands for restate the question answer the question, cite text evidence and explain. OK. So it's super, super applicable for a lot of different types of open ended questions where you're having to explain your answer c text evidence. If it has any of that kind of lingo in the question, your students can use this strategy. And once again building that habit, once you've done it for a few days or weeks, it just becomes instinctive to use the lingo that you've created with your text evidence, starters and to follow this strategy, I also linked in here, uh a link for further reading. So keep in mind that you've, you've got that available to you. Um And we're gonna just go through the steps of the strategy. So restating the question, this is one that you know, it relates. So um so well to student success, when they need to write a complete sentence, if you just restate the question and use the language of the question in your answer, uh Half the battle of writing a complete sentence is over, you know, um it's all there in the question. So you remove the question word from the question and write it as a statement. So this itself restating the question as a sentence that could be an activity that you practice with your students. So an example would be who was responsible for the broken vase. Like they're reading a story about, you know, some kids who broke a vase. Um You could reply in your answer, Jennifer was responsible for the broken vase. So you've taken out the question word of who and you've put your answer in there and you've got a sentence, it's that easy, then you're going to answer the question. So you restate and answer the question that can happen in the same sentence. But it's crucial to make sure that the entire question is answered. So the technique that you can take into this with your students is have them like underline or point to or circle or highlight whatever you want the words in the sentence that are, you know, basically showing them what's being asked. And if you think about it, that's an important technique that translates across curricular or cross subject areas. You know, think about reading a word problem in math and how you have to break down what's actually being asked of you in that word problem so that you don't accidentally do it opposite of how you're supposed to for the word problem. The same thing is true in el A or an opened in science question or social studies, make sure that the entire question is answered. And once again, it's a habit so that students, you know, slow down and read thoroughly. Next is citing text evidence. We talked about this previously with sentence starters. So again, we're building on what we've done in the previous section and bringing it into a paragraph and to go along with that for the explained portion where they explain how their text evidence supports their answer. Um I have a document for explanation, sentence starters to help them. And so, you know, if you think about writing as being a progression, you know, when you pick up habits and tools at the sentence level, it doesn't mean that you abandon them when you get to the paragraph level. Here's two places where you're actually using those uh those sentence starters to help you write a really great paragraph. And also keep in mind when you're talking to your students about the expectation of writing with complete sentences and creating paragraphs to open ended questions. You can do that with science, you can do it with social studies, you can do it with El A and just every time they're doing that they are writing and they are adding to their habit of writing. So then when you know, they move up to the next grade or when they have to answer a constructive response on the state test or they have to write essays or whatever the case may be, they're going to be ready for it. So these are pretty powerful tools that your students can apply towards their own learning and understanding. So our next section is graphic organizers. All righty. Now, graphic organizers are one of my favorite things about El A. Um Once again, can be applied to a lot of different situations in El A and it can go cross curricular with science and social studies as well. So bear in mind that these kinds of graphic organizers we're looking at, you might be showing them to your students in a lot of different areas. Um Keep in mind also. And I think I talk about this a little bit later in the slides too, but I wanted to reiterate it now when your students go into the testing room. All right. All of the, the comforts of home are stripped away. They are in an unfamiliar place. They're sitting in a group of students that they don't know, probably um they might have AAA test administrator that they don't know. And so test anxiety is a real thing. And it can be, uh, kind of overwhelming sometimes, you know, and it's hard, it's hard to remember what it's like when you're a little kid, um, when you've, you know, gone decades and years way beyond that. But if you teach your students how to use things, like taking notes, graphic organizers using scratch paper when they're, you know, working online, they can take those habits into the testing room with them. All right. And so this example that I'm gonna show you um on the next slide is one of those really good graphic organizers that if you practice that with your students, they can have that visual picture in their mind as they're going into the test room. So when they encounter, you know, a question about like what's the main idea of this passage? They could jot that graphic organizer down and fill it in with the passage that they just read and they're gonna feel successful, you know, they're gonna feel capable and they're gonna know that they can answer those questions with, you know, 100% correctness because they've got that visual in front of them to help them. So remember, graphic organizers really helpful to help your students recall what they do know. Um So just to talk about graphic organizers in general, they help us track info. And for you as the teacher, they can also help see where your students have gaps in their information. So for instance, if your student is filling out this main ide graphic organizer and they, they know the main idea right there, like they read the passage and they were like, this is the main idea and you're thinking, oh, but what if you have to provide text evidence and a question about that, you know, where are you going to be able to show me that that is in the passage? That's when you can say, let's take this a step back and actually look for the supporting details because you're right, you found the main idea, but I need to see more. I need to know more about what you're doing. Um So graphic organizers can be really helpful in that regard for the teacher as well. They make a nice visual representation for written responses. Um I love outlines. I find them to be very, very helpful. Um not only as a writer myself but also for students because it shows them sort of almost like a checklist, you know, like first in my introduction, I'm going to write about this and then, oh yeah, I forgot I need to put in my thesis statement and I need to make sure that I've done a hook of some sort to pull my reader in. Um you know, then it makes body paragraphs very, very quick and easy to put together. So outlines and graphic organizers kind of go hand in hand in being super helpful for getting our writing organized. Now, in contrast to sentence and paragraph frames. Um graphic organizers allow for a lot more fluidity. You know, it's more about the planning and the creativity rather than having um sort of the answer built, you know what I'm saying? Um At this point with a graphic organizer, like there's still that scaffolding that's happening with the graphic organizer. But it is also allowing us to, you know, give more freedom to our students, which I did notice on our jam board, some people wrote freedom of expression. You know, when we're talking about a sentence frame, there's very little uh freedom of expression. Then when you move into graphic organizers, like a brainstorm as an example, that's when you really get to see students, let it go and, and have a lot of fun with the creativity that they're having. And remember once again, reiterating that the more we practice using graphic organizers, the better our students will remember them and be able to use them when they go into the testing room. So I was going to uh like actually go through a sample text and provide a sa uh a sample question where we could break down this graphic organizer. But I think in the name of, of time and respecting the time that we have left, um you know, I will kind of give you the gist of the text and then the sample question will make more sense. Um Basically, the sample text uh is about, you know, light disruption. When people have a lot of lights on, on the coastline in Florida, it can cause sea turtle hatchlings to get kind of disoriented. Instead of going towards the sea, they turn and go inland. So basically, they're trying to uh you know, during the the hatching season, they're trying to get people to turn their lights off a little bit more during those hours when they know the turtles are going to be hatching. So kind of cool. Anyway, um moving on into constructive responses, which we've been talking about quite a bit um with open ended questioning, but we're gonna go more in depth with that here. So basically, a constructed response is any kind of open ended question um that goes beyond the yes or no. And they're wanting you to build a response usually centered around text evidence. Um Now, keep in mind uh that's where you're incorporating things like sentence starters and paragraph frames. Um You have a combination of both of those techniques when you're putting together a constructed response and you also have that prompt. Um Think back to when we were talking about using the language of the question in your answer. I if you do that, usually the people who score constructed responses, uh you know, they kind of have a, a rubric or, or some metrics that they're hoping writers are hitting. And so using the language of the question, you're incorporating the vocab that they're looking for. So for instance, if the question says infer and your student also puts infer into their sentence, then, you know, that kind of is like a point in their favor automatically because they're using that lingo um getting students used to making constructive responses helps in a lot of different ways. Um First off, you can build really big paragraphs um just by following like the basic steps of constructive responses. So the example that I previously gave was something like, you know, name three reasons. So that constructed response, it already has three reasons built in. So each one of those reasons is gonna get its own sentence. All right, then you have sort of an opening statement uh where you reflect the language of the question, you have your three reasons and then you have your concluding sentence that explains your answer. So right there, right off the bat, you have a five sentence paragraph. So your student who maybe a few weeks ago was like, I don't know how to write paragraphs or I don't know how to write sentences or they don't even tell you that they don't know how to write those things. They just answer ID K, you know, you can leave them in a very short amount of time from being not a writer to being able to write a paragraph and a pretty big paragraph to boot inferences also become a lot easier. Um especially when students get into the habit of using the language of the question in their answer. Um They're kind of picking up on the hint that is being provided to them in the question. So I think that that's one of the things kids struggle a lot with. When they read a question, they don't really slow down and think. All right, when they're asking me to infer, they're basically saying, make an educated guess. Um And then I have to provide it where I got that, you know, inspiration for that educated guess. All right, so you kind of do that breakdown, like when you're building the question into an answer, you're thinking about what they're really asking of us. So it kind of takes it from just sort of superficially reading the question and makes it more of an in depth active reading activity, but all in a very short amount of time as well. Um And like I say, at the end that then allows it to be in easier to introduce greater depth of knowledge because they're going through those mental steps of reading the question, transferring it into the beginning of their answer and then going into the text to find their answer and then explaining how it supports their inference or their answer, whatever the case may be. So as they go through that process of writing, their reading techniques become better, so pretty powerful stuff. Um a few weeks, well, actually, I think it was longer ago Lauren asked me to provide some research that was about writing and its impact on reading. And I had a, I had always known this as a reader and a writer and as a teacher of those things, but like, actually reading the evidence that supports that they're so symbiotic if you want to be a better reader, be a better writer. And if you wanna write, you need to read, I mean, they, they are so tied together, you know, it's amazing. I it was actually a really fun. Uh couple of hours of research, I really enjoyed it. But anyway, with that being said, now we're gonna move into using an actual supplemental um where you can add some activities to your students uh workload, but in a very, very um easy to handle manner. OK. So the next thing we're gonna talk about is quick rights with no red ink. All right. So first off, these are students or these are ideal for students at any level of mastery. Um No, writing has a lot of different quick rights that are related to skills. So if you've got those students who are needing that practice, like at the grammatical level of sentence construction, uh you've got some quick rights that you can give them if you've got students who have more of a creative writing bend. Um They have quick rights for that if you want to tie it to text evidence, um they have literary analysis quick rights. And if you've got students who are just kind of reluctant, like they just are struggling. Um One thing that I think would be fantastic to do with a student is to actually go into the quick rights, which are linked right here and show them some of the options and then ask them to choose which ones they would like to write about. You know, it's all about expression. So let them have, you know, the, the the agency to pick their own. So they have featured. And when you click into that, you can see a lot of different options over here on the side. If you've got students who are maybe pretty low level uh readers or they're really struggling with, you know, the whole writing thing to begin with. Try some of these like for fun, um different kinds of prompts, like picture prompts. I was talking with the narrating people yesterday and I said, you know, I feel like the picture prompts would be really great for, you know, either kids who are in grade level, but they are working below grade level if you've got ell students, because it's got that visual element that could be really fun if, if you've got younger students. So picture prompts would be really great for that. And you also have science and social studies so you can bring in that cross curricular work. Uh You also have just for fun activities and then you also have literary ones as well. So, going through that with your students and just having them pick a few would be such a great practice for them. Um, first off, it lets them have some fun picking out the assignments, but then it also, um, gives them some writing activities to do as well. So back to what quick writes are, um, just in general, they are intended to take about 5 to 10 minutes to write. So no more so than AAA good sized paragraph after you've, you know, kind of developed what a paragraph is, what goes into it and all that good stuff. Um Like I said before and like we've seen, they have a lot of different topics to help engage students and it can be as rigorous or as unstructured as you need it to be. So, you know, I'm a big fan of not making things harder for teachers or students, uh you know, by in the sense of like not giving them busy work. OK. So quick rights are pretty easy to incorporate in a very quick way that doesn't like totally upend your day. So here's an example, the soundtrack of your life. Um The prompt is pretty fun. If you could create a soundtrack for your life, what songs would you include and why? Um And let's say I wanna go ahead and assign that to my students. So when I look at the assignment page, I can add or subtract to this uh prompt as much as I want to like, if you wanted to make a whole soundtrack, think about how many songs that would be like 10 or 15 songs, you know, but they have it set to just two, which is pretty manageable for students, I think. But let's say that you have somebody who's really struggling, um you might lower it down to just a single song. Like what song sort of is you, you know, you can also adjust the link like if you wanted to make it a true, like in depth creative writing, you know, assignment and you wanted it to be an entire soundtrack. Like you could make it into a full essay type of writing, you know, but keeping it just at a paragraph that kind of keeps it in the time frame of just 5 to 10 minutes and then you can make it super easy on yourself too. From a grading standpoint, it can be automatic based on word count. They get to that 75 word count and it will automatically register as a 100 if you want to have a little bit of control over, you know, like what exactly are they saying? Are they practicing complete sentences? Are they practicing, you know, good paragraph construction. I'm gonna assign a 0 to 100% grade. You can set it to that too. You can also grade it on a rubric. So if you wanted to expand that into a complete essay. You know, you could grade it on a rubric and then just apply, you know, like the rubric that is provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Whatever the case may be, you can go up or down in terms of how strict or rigorous you want this to be. You can also add focus areas. So these are ways that you can cue your students to what you're going to be grading on and reminding them. We want complete sentences. We want to make sure that we are hitting the word count and you wanna make sure that you're discussing at least two songs, you know, just reinforcing what the prompt is asking you for. So, and you can see. So I had it set for 375 words and noticed that it expanded that to be, you know, about an hour for them to write. And then when I lower it back down to one paragraph, it drops it down to 10 to 15 minutes. So remember there's a, a sliding scale of how much work it can take to produce an assignment for your students. So quick writes. Pretty awesome things going back into our presentation. Um One last thing about quick writes, just keep in mind that you can use them for a lot of different reasons. They can be for fun, creative writing, um just getting the thought process going, they can help your students build on specific skills and they can help your students understand constructed responses. So they're pretty fantastic things in, in general. All righty. So now we're gonna start wrapping it up. We're gonna talk back about those icann statements. So we're gonna be returning to our jam board. All right. So if you've still got that, I'm gonna drop that into the chat one more time. All righty. So we're actually gonna go, go over to the second slide. Um Think about our different uh icann statements. The first one was I can utilize stu tools to get my students writing at their current level. I can put resources I gather today to use in building a daily writing habit for my students and I can support my students as they advance into higher writing skills. So on a scale from 1 to 10, um just you can stick it or you can put a text box or whatever the case may be uh on a scale from 1 to 10. How do you feel about the icann statements at this point? Nice. All right. It seems like people are feeling pretty good about it um that they, they can take at least one thing from today's presentation and be able to apply it in their daily work with their students. That's awesome to see. All right. Now, you guys can go ahead and continue to add your responses to the I can statements. I'm gonna take it back to the presentation for myself. Um I think I actually answered or used all my poll questions that I needed to, um, especially since it wouldn't pop up after the first one. So at this point, we've got some time to ask any questions that anyone has. So I'm gonna turn off screen share and we're just gonna talk as a group. Um Any questions that anyone has at this point? Are you all feeling good or are you all feeling shy? Ok, I'm seeing some responses. That's good. Awesome. I am really glad to hear it. Um First off, um, before I give you guys the, the survey and the concluding uh slide and wrap things up, I just want to give you guys a shout out for attending during the noon hour. I like this time because I know a lot of people take their lunch at this point and that means I have a better chance of catching you. But I also know that that means you're dedicating some of your, your personal time during the day to listening to me talk and I thank you so much. I appreciate that very, very much. Um Other things. Next month we have a PLC season gearing up and the instructional coaches, we have put together a really awesome presentation. So if you have a chance to attend A PLC where we're going to be presenting, um That's awesome. And I can't wait to see you guys if you um if your MD I is going in a different direction, which is also cool. I know that they've got some really cool things uh that they're, you know, developing for next month. But if you wanna see that presentation, feel free to reach out to either your principal and say, hey, why don't we have this as a team meeting kind of thing? Or you can reach out to the I CS through our office hours and um you know, we can give you the rundown like in a one on one session. Speaking of office hours, one on one sessions with me cover a whole lot of different topics. I support no red ink obviously because we talked about it today near pod um vocabulary. I'm also over sora. So if you ever have any books that you wanna see in the library and you want, you know, to get in on that or talk about novel studies or anything like that, you come to me and I can also talk with you about el a strategies planning uh helping your kids do better on formative, whatever the case may be. I am here to talk to you. So uh you can access all of those links on Epic One. And uh I think that that just about covers it. So I'm gonna share my screen one more time and take us over to the presentation so you guys can uh do your exit survey and I will also drop that link in to the chat if you don't want to mess with Q codes. There we go. All righty and Betsy, I think you have a, can you shut off recording too? I think at this point, I think we're good to turn off the recording.\"), (2097, 747, 5014, \"All right, happy Tuesday guys. We're happy to see you guys for our fundamental training. Um We kinda have a big week this week. We have, um, today we're gonna go over mostly assessments and um those type of things. And then Thursday we're gonna have a good training with our um tech TV SS on our school and some of those things. So that's gonna be a really um informational, good day to come to too. Um, a few reminders for today, we have our Q and A sheet, we'll put um the link to at the end. So if you have questions, you can type them in there and we will answer them like we have been. Um and then um reminder for virtual etiquette, make sure you have your camera on. You're um sitting up um make sure you're focused and um paying attention to our training today. And um what else? And then just a reminder to keep checking Epic one. It's such a good resource and I know in my small groups we've gone through how to just search for random things and look for things. If you just search in that search bar at the top. There's so many good things you can find and all the resources and information that you could need. Um So those are just a few reminders for this morning. And um yeah, we'll go ahead and get started. So this is week four. I can't believe next week is our last week of summer training and then the week after that is um school starting. So it's just crazy how fast it's gone and it's been a great summer with you guys. So this is week four assessment. So we're gonna go over clever sign on benchmarking star and then performance matters with you guys for today and a reminder, we'll send all these slides and all the recording and everything to you um following this training from our teacher development email. So you guys will have that handy and you guys can look for the resources. All right, we'll go ahead and get started with Clever sign on. So Clever Sso stands for a single sign on. All right. So what is clever? So you've probably heard us talk about Clever. Um So what is it? It is a single sign on that enables Epic teachers, students and staff. So everybody basically at Epic to securely authenticate and log into connected applications via the Clever portal. Um So users log in to Clever just with one set of credentials, then they click on various app icons to automatically log into platforms via single sign on So you and your students can sign on the clever one, sign on and then you'll be able to go to all these different programs. So, if you have your students in their core curriculum there, they can click on their co curriculum and be able to find it. If you have supplemental curriculums, you can find those in there. Normally too, you can add other things that you need in there that your, um, students might be working on or they might need. So it's just really nice because it's a one stop shop for all the things that they might need to log into. And it's just easy because I just have to remember, log in for one thing rather than a million because I know I forget my passwords all the time for all the different things that we have passwords for these days. All right. So a few clever highlights. So it offers teachers and students the simple secure login experience. So it's secure. Um, you log in with your Google stuff. So it makes it real easy. Um It's the one stop shop that houses digital learning curriculum supplements and resources. There's so many things in there and then it saves time by allowing the users the ability to log in to one platform to seamlessly visit the various applications necessary. So it's just one spot that they can add into. All right, and then the students can find everything in one place. So this is what it looks like from the from their view. And its districts specify the right resources for each class based on the data from the cyst. So that's our student information system. So um Epic will have certain ones that will come on and I mean certain applications that will load automatically into clever. So those will be there. Um You can add even more classroom resources. So there's ones that will automatically be loaded. But if you wanna add some different ones, you can do that. Um There's a search bar and you can search for different programs and things that you might wanna add and then students are able to quickly immerse themselves in digital learning. So like in the past, with Epic, we would give our students a whole login sheet of stuff like there's this curriculum and how to log in, here's this curriculum and how to log in. Now, they can just log in a clever and like 99% of their curriculum will be in this one spot rather than them having to remember a million sign in. So they can easily get into their school work for the day without having a second guess. How do I get in there? Where is my curriculum? How do I log in? But all right. So how do you access Clever. So this is the link on the right side of this screen. So teachers and students access Clever with that link. Um It'll look like this picture on the left. So you just log in with your Google. Um And it's real easy, kind of like we do with most of our things at Epic. It's just a Google sign in it makes it real simple. Um And so that's the link right there. And I'm gonna show you on the next few slides how to um some other ways to find that link. So you don't have to have that saved right there. So where is the link? No worries. So if you go to your Epic One page again, like I said at the beginning, Epic One has a million different resources and things that are real handy for us. So if you go to the launcher on the top right page or top right of your page on Epic One, it's that little rocket ship. If you click that, then you can go down and you will find the clever login. So you see right there under the bamboo is the clever login. Um And you can notice also that the fresh service can be accessed there as well. So that's our ticketing where you can ask questions um whenever you're having issues with anything, um you can see fresh services there also. So that's one spot you can find the uh link for Clever. Another way is via the Bookmark Bar. So hopefully, everybody by this point has that staff links um on the Bookmark Bar. I know a bunch of us had that issue at the beginning, but it should be fixed hopefully. Now, um, so you can click that and go down to that curriculum logins and then Clever will be right there as well. That's the way I normally access it just because it's the easiest and it's always right there for me. So I go down to curriculum logins and then Clever and that's the same way your students will find it as well. They'll go to curriculum and then they'll go to Clever. And then if you want, you can also create a bookmark and put it on your own bookmark. If you would like to do that, if you don't wanna have to click those three ways. All right. So log in and portal. So upon logging in, each user will see their own portal. So when homeroom is selected, the following things will be displayed. So teacher pages, favorites, district core curricula, supplemental apps, Google apps and staff resources. Um So you can use your landing page to best suit your individual needs. You can kind of edit it and you can favorite some. And so you can see on that little picture right there, there's a favorites one. So you can start the ones that you use most often and they'll go right to that spot. Um And you can have quick access to the app. So you'll have all the apps listed here that any of your students are using um, your students won't have as many as you because they'll just have the ones they're in. But you have all of them there, which is really nice. So if you have a bunch of students in one, you can favorite it. Put it at that spot, make it real easy to find and, um, access. All right. Ok. So, feature information. These are all really handy links. We're not gonna click through them, but they are really handy. And um if you're having issues with any of these things, I just want to find out more about any of these. Um So the clever portal, if you have questions about teacher pages, how to add applications, um sending messages or announcements and then analytics. So if you need to learn more about um figuring out the analytics of, did my student log in? How long did they log in for all those information? So these are just resources that are real handy and you can um pull up if you need to find out more information about those. All right, login issues. So again, if you're having login issues, we're gonna go to that fresh service ticket to the SSS department. So you can go to that launcher and go to fresh service. Um And that's one of one way you can find that you can also do it again. And the staff links on the left, there's lots of options. You can kind of figure out a pattern that most of our important, um, links and things are in those two spots. So they're kind of easy to find. Um So you'll click fresh service and then once you're there, you're gonna do a ticket to system support and they'll help you be able to log in. Um, hopefully you don't have login issues. But if you do, that's the way to the way to handle it. And then clever support. I have found this clever support to be actually one of the more helpful um like support pages on any website that I've seen. So if you click that question mark at the top and you can go to help center, it will pop up like a little, it's almost like a chat box, but it's not really chatting with a real person. But if you type your issue, it normally will pull up your issue immediately like a website or how to steps or whatever. And it's super helpful on um whatever issue you might be having. Um So that's one way if you're having a, have a question or wanna figure something out quick, you can use that help center. Um And let's see. And then there's the clever support website that has all sorts of stuff that you need. And then quick guides on Clever Academy is there as well. And then teachers can find these links also by clicking on the icon on the blue navigation bar, um Help center and Clever Academy So that's that question mark. I was just talking about this will be there. All right, I'm gonna pass it over to Miss Betty B for some benchmarking. OK. We get to talk about benchmarking. I know that this is probably something that you guys have talked about in your principal groups or you've heard that teachers talking about? Um I know some of my teachers have asked, can we go ahead and start scheduling benchmark testing? So I think that kind of depends more on your principal and your team and what you're wanting if you're going to those I LP S, if they're wanting you to go ahead and schedule those benchmarks, um even though you don't really know anything because we're just now hitting the training on it, um You can still schedule them because we have a benchmark window that we'll talk about in these slides. Ok. So first things first, who is required to take this, our pre K through first graders over here? Um Pre K does not have to take it during this first window. So this first fall window, pre K does not have to take it at all. Um When their window opens in the winter, they will take start early literacy. That being said, you're more than welcome to give them the start early literacy. If you're wanting to give them something to have like a starting base of where they're at, you're more than welcome. It's just not mandatory and then kindergarten are going are going to take the early star literacy and then first grades taking star, early literacy and math. Then our second through eighth graders are taking star math, not early literacy, but star math and reading. And then our high school students are not required to take benchmarks. We are wanting to focus on um their ac T prep. So just because they're not required to take benchmarks doesn't mean that you can't use a tool to assess where they're at. And there are tools and options available in your school home room that you can see where your high school students are and then how to access this. This is again in your clever. So what Susie touched on before that handy dandy, everything you need to sign into all these fun programs are in your clever account. So you'll go to your Clever and log in and then there's an app and it's gonna be under the big R Renaissance app. And then you can see after you click that on step three that there's the star early literacy, the star, reading the star Math, and then proctoring those benchmarks. We want to make sure that we are with our students. When they are taking this benchmark. We don't want to just say, hey, here's your benchmark. They wanna take it and we wanna be there. We wanna Proctor, we wanna make sure that they are doing their best their first time. This is a, a way for us to see where our students are. Currently. A lot of these students you guys are getting or all of them really? You guys are new teachers that you don't know anything about these kids. You don't know where they're at, where, where they're may be struggling. And so when you start talking about supplements and things like that, you don't really know what to get that student yet until we take this benchmark. So it's highly encouraged to make sure that they do their best. That way, we have a really good picture of where they're at and discuss that with the families. Let them know what this benchmark is for and why it's important that they do their best, um and make sure that the student is in their own account, not. And sometimes if you're using your own computer, you might have a student log in from it or something like that. So just double check and make sure that it's the student that's in there taking the correct test, we cannot delete assessment. So after an assessment is done, that is in there forever, we can't go back and delete that. Um, if you're with the ears and you're doing it in a group, it is a verbal test. So we wanna make sure that they have headsets. Um If you're doing a one on one that's fine, make sure it's in a quiet room where they can hear that verbal um information being presented in that test and then assessments are password protected. You will generate this yourself as a teacher and we have a document of how to do that. And we're gonna talk about that here in a minute too. But, um, the star passwords are created by you and then all star benchmarks must be Proctor in person, as I said, um, students are gonna log in and you guys will instruct them. It's the same thing. They're gonna go through the clever, it's really easy. Um But just make sure that you schedule a time with them that you can meet in person, you can do a group or you can do one on one. And then the setting is really the key to having a successful testing environment. Um You wanna consider these options, you want to consider the setting of where you are going to be at. Is it going to be at a coffee shop library or the student's home? Is the library your local library loud? I know mine is. So that wasn't always the best option for me, especially if maybe the family brought siblings, it tended to get really, really loud. Um So just kind of be mindful of that. You want the student to be able to work in an environment where they can focus and there's no distractions and then determine is it group or individual? If you're testing in a group of students, how are you going to have the students log in. Are you going to stagger? Are you going to have them all do it at the same time as you walk them through it and kind of some things to think about and talk to your T DS about those kinds of helpful hints. And then do you need to do individual testing? I know again, like I said, you don't know your students yet that you might decide to do group this time and then you might have a couple that you're like, oh, I'm gonna do one on one next time because that did not go over very well. So some do well in groups and some maybe we need to do one on one and then definitely don't wait until the last minute to schedule benchmarks. I know that we have a window just because we have that window doesn't mean waiting till the end of the window to schedule. You wanna do it as early in the window that you can. Um really that window is for the towards the end is to be able to do your reschedules. If you have kiddos who couldn't make the first scheduled meeting, then we have time to reschedule or um maybe we get students who are enrolled later on, then we wanna benchmark them in that window, but we can have them at the end. Don't save all your kiddos for the end and there will be rescheduled. I will say that so prepare for that. Ok. So we're gonna dive in a little bit and look at this benchmark schedule. This will be linked here in the presentation as well. Um But this is the yearly, the overall year benchmark schedule for you guys. So you can see that first column, August 14th through September 1st is our first benchmark window. And over there to the left pre K is not required and then you'll see kindergarten, kindergarten through third startler literacy and then it says, please see CBM, the guidance tab for additional information. So you can see down at the bottom, there's AC BM requirement tab. So make sure you look at that tab and, and review that, that way, you know what that is talking about. There's also an OAP tab so that if you have OAP students, what their requirements are and then kind of get ahead and look, look at what the next window is. Our next window is November 27th through December 15th. So as we get closer to that window and you guys are doing meetups, it might be good to start scheduling that ahead of time. Um Things change, their schedules will change and that's fine. But if you can have something on your calendar and on your book and then make those adjustments as needed, it just helps you guys get ahead of the game. So definitely refer back to this beco be aware of the upcoming benchmark windows, ok? So high school benchmarks, like we said, they are not required this year. Um High school benchmark tests will still be available for teachers and families who are wanting to take them and those can be accessed in your school homeroom and the high school students will all have their own home room that they can access those. Um instead of benchmarks, we're having students complete their AC T prep courses, they will be working out of either Alex, no red ink or Magus depending on what grade level that they're in. Exemptions for any AC T prep course will only be given to those students who have national AC T test of 22 or above in English reading and Math and they must also have an MD I approval and then there's also a diagnostic test available in the red ink. The initial placement test will be of value in Alex and teachers should assign practice AC T test in the goose to prepare students for the AC T test. April some other assessments to be mindful of for our high school kiddos. We do us citizen and ology homeroom. The US citizenship test will be open in October and students must have the study guide for at least 30 days before taking that test and then practice AC T benchmarks are again and homework. So let's talk through some comment, benchmark, frequently asked questions. Can I give a benchmark at an I LP meeting? No, that's the short answer. Um, long answer is it takes at least 48 hours for that student's information to roll over into the system. Therefore, they're not gonna be set up, um, to log in and take their benchmark. We encourage teachers to schedule a separate meeting. You can schedule those benchmark meetings while you're at the I LP meeting. So while you're there, you have the family there, you can say, hey, our benchmark window is at this time. What would be a good day for you to come and meet up for benchmarks and you might give them just a couple day options or maybe that first week option maybe don't tell them the whole window so that they don't schedule themselves for the last week as well. Um Can students take their test on a mobile device? No, these assessments must be taken on a laptop or a chromebook phones and ipads will not work for it and students can take assessments on a PC or Apple computers, but again, no tablets or mobile devices and then my student's computer died slash reset. Had the connection interrupted during the test. What do I do? Star actually saves the students work in progress. So the students should be able to log right back in and start where they left off. The question itself may be different but the progress is saved. Then what do I do? If a student enrolls during a benchmark window, they will have to participate in that benchmark window, whatever window it is that they're enrolled in. So if you do have a student who enrolls and it is like you're at the very end of that benchmark window, it's really important that maybe you set up that I LP meeting, but also the benchmark meeting as you're doing that too. And how do I, what do I do? Sorry, what do I do if a student enrolls between benchmark windows? So between benchmark windows, new students should be benchmarked within 10 days of the I LP completion. So maybe we've already ended this first benchmark and you get a new student, we don't want to just not give them one because it's not required. We still, the whole purpose of the benchmarks is to see where our student is. So we have no way of knowing where our student is unless we give them that benchmark. So even though it's out of the benchmark within the 1st 10 days, we want to give them a benchmark. So we can figure out what the learning plan for that student would be. Are there any exceptions for taking benchmark tests? No, all students in pre K through eight must be benchmark. Um This is also stated on the I LP whenever you meet with the family. So maybe this is something that you really hit on in your expectations is, hey, we, we require these benchmarks, they're gonna happen these time frames. You guys have that schedule um and also let them know the state testing for your state test kiddos. But these help us um we have practice AC T bench marks available as well and it just helps uh parents prepare for those national and state tests. So let's do a quick review because that's a lot. Um So high school students again are not required to benchmark. We are offering them a CD benchmarks if they want to for practice. And then pre K is not required for the first window, one K through eight. But you can still give your pre K just, you don't have to um testing takes place in the Star app found under the Renaissance app in Clever and Windows are only three weeks long. So plan accordingly, don't wait until the last week. An optional fourth window for showing growth for students is available and then optional progress monitoring the entire year. So you don't have to just give this one test and be done. You can go back and give them this test over and over again if you wanna monitor their growth throughout the school year, but you just have to give it at least in the benchmark window. All right hand this over to Kaitlyn. Thank you, Betty. And so uh Betty just covered our benchmark and what we give. So now we're gonna dig a little bit deeper into Star and actually how to give that assessment and how it's built and created because I know some of you, if you don't have an early childhood background, you've probably never seen the star or given the star before. And so that was me coming into epic with a high school background. And so we want to make sure that you guys understand what the star assessment is actually doing with your students, but also how to prepare yourself for giving that in a proper manner as well. So what is Star and the Star assessment are short tests that provide teachers with learning data and they are adaptive to students and they adjust um to each answer your student provides and this helps teachers get data that is best to help students in the shortest amount of time and that is very reliable in their results. So um just so you guys know in your planning and each step, our test is roughly about 20 to 30 minutes depending on your student and their ability and they are um short and condensed and like I mentioned, they are adaptive. So as your student continues to answers, answer questions correctly, they are going to adapt up in level. Um And as they or if they reverse of that, they are answering them incorrectly, it will adapt to lower standards. So keep that in mind and that's why we always say it's best practice to proctor these in person and really monitor these students. So you can understand where their deficits are and where their achievements are as well. So no matter what test you take in star, it's adaptive like I mentioned previously and it will alter the progression of questions based on how the student answers. So it is extremely important that because this test is adaptive that we do not help students at all. And this needs to be communicated to parents as well. We all know that we want our, our parents want their Children to succeed. So it's super easy for a mom to sit next to them and say, oh, remember we've talked about this or oh, look at all of your answers. We appreciate parents and their willingness to help their students succeed. But we want to see truly what the student knows and how we are going to plan accordingly to teach them individually for the rest of that school year. And so because that star is adaptive again, we want to communicate to all parties that are in the room taking that test at that time that they have to do it on their own in their own um capabilities. And we don't want to provide false information and to the algorithm that star uses. And we don't want that to change the difficulty of the test. Remember, we talked about how it is adaptive and progressive. So if a student is getting help and they're getting answers correct, it's just gonna continue to get harder and harder and more frustrating for that student when they are actually doing work on their own. So keep that in mind. Um, again, be best practice and something that I always used as a teacher with my students is mom and dad. I'm just gonna keep them for 30 minutes. You can take brother or sister over to the playground next door or whatever that looks like. And in the facility that you're giving this test in that way you can properly monitor your students without any distractions at all. But again, here, we're looking at our students knowledge sting. Um And so we just want to evaluate them and see exactly where they are in order to continue on with their education journey after this assessment is given. So you will be giving based on your roster several different types of tests. So we want you to make sure we want to make sure, excuse me that you understand, kind of what they look like that way you're prepared for when you give these tests to your students the first time. So your star early lit is for pre K starting in the winter window all the way through first grade. So your kindergarten through first grade students will be taking it in this first window and there's approximately 27 questions and based on your students ability, it could be 15 to 20 minutes. And so keep that in mind every student is different. So it's always important to schedule a good 30 minute windows for these kiddos. To get them in, get them logged in, get them prepared and set up for the test and then appropriate amount of time to complete the test. And so there is a time limit of 90 seconds per question on that star early lit. And so what that looks like is there is 90 seconds per question. And if your student is getting close to that 92nd mark, there will be a timer and that counts down for that student. And if they do not answer the question in that appropriate amount of time, then it will just move on. Um And it will, it will, what's the word I'm looking for? Um It will assume that that student got it incorrect because there was no given answer and then it will adapt based on that. So sometimes this can be a trigger for students. It could be nerve wracking, but just remind your students to do their absolute best. And um you know, if they don't know something, we don't just want them clicking to guess. We want them to try and then go from there. Um With our early lit this does read questions to the students and it is audible like Betty said, we wanna make sure that they have headphones um and that they are prepared for that in the type of setting you're giving it. And so there is an option to repeat those questions. Um And it will do that automatically after. So many seconds have gone. So just be prepared. This is only on that early lit test and that it will provide that student with the audio and questions. So then we move on to the star reading test for our second through eighth grade students. And this test is a little bit longer. Our kids have a little bit more of an attention span. So there's roughly 34 adaptive questions and this one will last 25 to 30 minutes. And again, this varies on students. Um If they are a high performing student and they are answering questions a lot faster, then they're gonna get through this assessment faster or vice versa. It may take them that entire 30 minute time to complete this assessment. And so the time limit varies from 45 seconds to two minutes depending on the grade level and the question in each section in that star reading test. And so practice questions will start at the very beginning and this will be something that you as the teacher are able to guide them through with those practice questions to ensure that they know how to complete the test appropriately. Um These practice questions do not count towards their overall data that we are taking from the test. Um But it is important that the student knows exactly how to navigate how to answer the questions appropriately. And keep in mind some of these students, if it's their first time with Epic, they may be using a chromebook for the first time and they may need a mouse to work with because they've never used the little pad um on a chromebook and every student is a little bit different. So keep these things in mind before you're going into these assessments as well because that might be something that you work with the student on before we do these practice questions. And that way when they get to the practice question, they can start answering them with more confidence. And we're not stressed out about not knowing how to use that pad on the chromebook or the mouse depending on which you have provided for them or they have. So keep that in mind. And if a student cannot independently complete the practice questions, we still want to move them through them to give that star early literacy test. We do have students that may not be able to answer some of those practice questions. And we want you as the facilitator to help them get through the practice questions um if they are needing help, but as soon as that actual assessment starts, they need to independently complete the rest of the start early literacy test. So keep in mind, this is mainly for your um lower functioning kiddos, your of kids, things like that and those kids that are unable to fully function and understand how to get through those practice questions. That's when you as the teacher can help um outside of that, again, just use your best judgment when getting them through the practice questions. And if they have been with us at Epic before, they've taken this assessment before multiple times. So it's familiar to them. And ideally if they aren't from Epic in their um in early childhood, they have taken it as well at another school. So um just keep that in mind. But again, if they need assistance, you can only help them during those practice questions. So keep that in mind. And then also for our first through eighth graders, they take the star math. Um So again, keep in mind your first through eighth graders, they're gonna be taking both reading and math or early lit and math. So keep in mind um when you're scheduling these, it's not just one or the other, it's gonna be both and how you schedule that with your families is up to you and some students, their attention span is that 30 minutes and they're done for the day. And so kind of keep that in mind and take that judgment into consider consideration whenever you are at that IOP meeting, meeting the family for the first time. And, and you can always change your mind, you can take one assessment and if that student is ready and they still have some motivation to continue on to the next go for it. If they don't, then maybe we wanna reschedule and do it again. The next day or go take a, a brain break, let them play outside for a little bit and then come back and complete the other assessment. So just any of those scenarios can happen and they will happen. So just keep thinking about those as you are getting to know these families and what can your student handle in an appropriate setting? Um But in that math and again, this is for first through eighth graders, there's 34 adaptive questions. So again, um if a student's taking both tests, they're gonna be doing 68 questions total. So just keep that in mind when planning and this one just like the reading is approximately 25 to 30 minutes in length and their time limit is three minutes per question. And so again, that timer will be going and count down for them when they get close to that three minute mark and students will log in through their clever and use the Renaissance app like Betty discussed earlier and then the password um is admin and you again, as the teacher will have the right to set that and make it whatever you want. And our ELC training um actually walks you through that, that you're gonna be watching this week. So, um when you're going through that ELC training, that will take you through the specific steps to get you to that um password guide. And so on our next slide, we actually have that link um we're not gonna go into um a ton of detail on this, but I do want you guys to see kind of what it looks like. But again, this is how you as the teacher are going to set that star password for your students and this will be set and all of your students will use it. Um So just keep in mind something that's simple. Um But following the guidelines as well, um so this will be given to you in the ELC. But again, um you will have control over this um and your own, you'll get to monitor this password so you can change it each window and keep it the same throughout. It is up to you, you get to monitor that. Um But this will all be done within that Renaissance app um before you go give the star test, so best practice would be that you have all of this set before you go give that first star assessment to your first student that you're benchmarking. Um So this is something that you will do prior to meeting your students for their benchmark and um navigating through that Renaissance Bar at the top and under your name, there's a drop down a little carrot that will take you and to where you need to go and edit preferences. And so in that drop down, you'll select edit preferences and then from your preferences, you are going to go to your classrooms. And so the class preference and then monitor password star test is what we're looking for there. And again, you guys will have access to these slides and these links. Um If you don't get all of these steps today, it's also in the ELC that is gonna be um delivered to you guys tomorrow in that platform. So just keep in mind you will set that password for whatever you want it to be. And then that is what you're going to use to log in for your students to take their assessment. All right. So some common questions um and answers over our star and so can I read a star math allowed to my students? And your answer is if you have a struggling reader and that pivots from the star reading to take star early literacy, the early literacy test, the student must take the star math if they're in grades one and up. Um in these cases, it's allowed to utilize the read, allow feature in star. And so all students taking the star early literacy can have math read allowed if deemed necessary. Um And so what this is referring to is um Betty discussed the benchmark sheet. It's kind of a cheat sheet for you guys. Um And then it went into the CBM guidelines. And so what that looks like is if and, and we'll go into further detail uh and a further training on this, but based on their score um in the star reading, they may have to go again and take that star early literacy test. Um And if they take that star early literacy test, then they will have that read aloud feature um if it's deemed necessary. So keep that in mind, um we will give further training on that at a later date when it's closer to time. Another question is, can a student use a personal ipad to do the star bench mark? Yes, they can. And the student will need to ensure that they have downloaded and installed the Clever app and then sign in with their school account. And so it may be their personal ipad, but it has to be logged in through all of our epic information. And this is the only way that they'll have access to everything that they need in order to be successful to take their star. And again, Betty mentioned earlier chromebooks, laptops are the easiest way and you providing that for your students. Um But if they happen to have a, a school ipad or their own that they use on a daily basis, especially your, your kindergarteners and possibly some first graders if they've been with us and they have ipads, they do have access to those and use and can use those. And we just prefer for the older grades to use those chromebooks. So keep that in mind. Um What do I do if my student cannot make it past the practice questions we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier. Um but the practice questions do not count in the student score. Therefore, you may have to help the student complete the practice questions in order to advance them to the actual test. If the student is struggling reading or a sped student with accommodations, be sure to have the conversation with your principal about whether giving the star early literacy test to the student would be most appropriate. And so in these cases, according to RS A guidelines, we have to give the student the required assessment first for their grade level. Um even if it is an O A student. So if we have a third grade o A student, we still need to give that third grade OAP student that star reading test first based on their ability. Remember those questions will adapt for that student and um you may help them get through that practice, but we wanna see their actual knowledge because this um this data is also reported to the state for RS A purposes. Um but again, if that student is, is truly struggling and they cannot make it through that um star reading and it finally kind of closes out because they're not answering questions and they are not capable of answering questions, then discuss with your principal of conversation of giving them that early literacy test followed. And that way we can truly get some data as to what they do know. Um but again, they have to take the grade level required assessment first and then we can move down to something lower if needed or appropriate for the student. And so again, we can't forget about that dyslexia House Bill 28 04. We talked about this last week. And so this is referred to as the star CBM. And it, it does not provide a diagnosis for dyslexia. This is only a tool to help provide appropriate instruction for students. And this is required by law and it will be reported with RS A data during the year. And so again, this is one of those things that if um your student school below a specific percentile on their star reading or early literacy, you will then be required to give them this CBM screener and all of it is housed within the same Renaissance App. Um And as you uh let me see if I can go back to that slide where it shows um it does have all of it listed in your Renaissance. I'm sorry, I can't find it right now. But um when you open that up, it is there for you and um then you can see the star reading star math early lit and then there's an option for the star CV M. So keep that in mind um on our next slide, it does tell us um those kindergartners, we're not gonna look at that CBM until the winter window. Um but if they score below 40th percentile on their early literacy test, then they will be required to take the CBM and they will be taking the rapid color naming portion of that CBM. And if you have a first grader, the scores below the 40th percentile, and that's kind of the key percentile to think about. If the student scores below that 40th percentile on that first grade level assessment, then we're gonna drop it down to a lower assessment. And since star early literacy is the low one, we have our first graders will go straight to that Star CBM as well as those kindergartners um and take the appropriate CBM screener. And so for first grade, it's gonna be expressive nonsense words and rapid name coloring. And but then second grade, remember they start at the star reading and so if they score below grade level, which is below the 40th percentile, then we would give them the star early literacy test. If they continue to score below the 40th percentile on that star early literacy, then we go to the Star CBM Screener where they will take expressive nonsense words in rapid name, uh color naming and same thing with third grade. And that star reading, that's where they start at below 40th percentile. They go to early literacy below 40th percentile on that. Then they go to the Star CBM and this is something that is just for the reading portion of our star and it will not be done on math because again, that's completely different subject. So keep that in mind and there is a possibility that you are gonna have to assess a student on all three of those and different star assessments. So keep that in mind. Ok, a few things to consider with your star CBM. Um first through third grade students, um the star CBM must be given within 30 days of completion of the benchmark, but no later than November 1st in order to comply with RS A law. And so again, if you see in those results and that data given to you from the star that they are in that below 40 percentile, we need a automatically schedule a time to give them that Star CBM within 30 days and sooner the better is, is kind of best practice. So um students that come to us after November 1st and they will still be required to take both the star tests and, and if they qualify, they will take that Star CBM to pro to progress, monitor them. And so again, that's just just like a late enrolling. If they come to us after November 1st, that deadline, we want to still follow those same processes, one to see where they are as a learner. And so you can individualize their education. But also, and we just wanna make sure that we are monitoring them and able to teach the best we can to their specific needs. And so those are those guidelines you'll follow for kindergarten, kindergarten students and they must be given that star CBM within 30 days as well of the winter benchmark. Um So keep in mind our kindergarteners, you're just giving that star early lit. And um that's what they're gonna take in this window. We don't have to look at that percentile until after we have taught them a little bit to see where they are at. So in that winter window, that is when we will look at their percentile. If they are below 40 percentile, we will give them that CBM. Um It is best practice to give the star CBM immediately after star bench marking, if the student scored in the 39th percentile or below. And in that event, your student, your your star scores are not immediately available. Star CBM must be given within those 30 days. So you will also be taught how to pull reports. So you can look at this data and and see how to read what percentile they are in, I promise you. Ok. So we are going to move away from star and for a moment and we are going to go into performance matters. And so what is performance matters? Um Performance matters is an eae a epic data warehouse. And so this is a platform that you guys will get to through Clever as well or no, sorry, excuse me, through your power school. Um And this is going to be a, just a good place for you to look at data on your student. And so you will log in to performance matters through Power School. And in power school, you have a little waffle, um or checkerboard, whatever you call it in that top right corner of your screen. And from there that drop down, you will select the performance matters option. Um A dashboard is what you will see once you log in. And so you will have a dashboard of all of your students. And so these icons over here that are blurred out, those are your students and their names and their grades that they are in. And from there, you can select a specific student and you can go into specific courses or um I'm sorry, subjects in order to see data based on the assessment that they've taken and any detailed information that they have um completed with you. And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna look at test results. And so this is to view formative and so the formative will be housed in your Epic Ed platform and for your students that are in grades pre K through T and and then that the formative are basically their standard based assessments. And so the data that you wanna look at is after they've completed those formative, then you'll go to performance matters to look at those um all in one place. So to view formative or common. Um, you're gonna go to uh state test scores and benchmarks. Um This will give you additional scores for the student again based on the assessments they have taken with you um inside Epic Ed and outside. Um So within performance matters, you have access to a baseball card report and this report is going to be helpful for you and it is a navigation tool um on the menu in the left, you'll choose reports and then baseball card report. And so this is going to be something that um if you are grouping students or even just looking at a student individually for their needs, and this will give you that data. So this next picture that we're gonna show and gives you a little glimpse of what that baseball card looks like, but you have your students and their student ID and grade level, um and then you will have specific standards listed out on this baseball card and you can customize this baseball card by grade level. And so you're looking at one grade level across the board or all of your students on the roster at once. You can choose that on your own. And most of this data will be coming from principals and principals will most likely share these baseball card reports with you. And as they're tracking data throughout the. And so again, these are results from those students formative as you can see, they will highlight by color based on how that student does on those assessments. Um Obviously, if there's no color, they haven't completed that one yet. So this is just a good way and to help keep you accountable with tracking those formative the students are doing and as they go throughout the school year, and again, this will be discussed more on a principle by principle basis. And every principal kind of gives a different directive on these and how to go about these. So if you have questions, reach out to your TV S or your principal on those topics, OK. So the formative that are found within performance matters are the high school formative that are in theology home room and they will go into performance matters. So if you are wanting to assess those high schoolers and as they are getting prepared to, to learn a little bit more about them, that data will be shown and as well as third through eighth grades will take graders will take their first formative through Epic Ed. And if that standard is not mastered, then the teacher could reteach and then give formative b in the school home room. And so you have several options for students to complete these formative. And again, these formative are covering specific standards throughout the year. Um So you'll teach, they'll practice and then as you assess, you're gonna assess them using these formative. Um the first formative again, like I mentioned will be given through epi um but if we didn't show mastery on that, we need to go back and reteach, they can have a second option. Um We can't reset them with an EIC. So they have housed a formative B option inside your home room and you can give it a second, second time um with different questions um on the same standard that they needed retaught and then assessed again. So that is there for you. And um, we are going to be going into some of this school training and um in Power School on Thursday. So you will be getting training over those platforms as well. And um you will be able to grade open-ended response questions and evidence captures for high school formative and performance matters. And a lot of our high schoolers will be doing writing prompts um or like mentioned evidence captures where they have to attach and upload things that they have completed and this is where you are gonna go and you can grade those inside performance matters and just a few resources that we wanted to share with you guys. Um based off of today's um our Epic One assessments page, all things benchmarks, assessments will be on that page and these links will get you directly to that. Um The Epic One Star testing an informational page benchmark, frequently asked questions and the star testing checklist. And so again, we want to provide you guys with resources that will make it easier for you to remember all of this information that we are throwing at you. And so this is a great place to start when you're seeking some resources. And that is what we have for today. Um Again, our topics that we covered in today's training are clever sign on benchmarking star and performance matters. And in the chat box, you will find that Q and A document and please make sure that you're looking at the week four tab whenever you are putting questions on that Q and A sheet. Um Because that are, those are the questions referring back to today's training. So, um thank you guys for being here with us today and don't forget your small group Q and A s with your individual T DS teams that are on um tomorrow or Friday. And um if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach, hey, and I'm also gonna add before you guys go because there's quite a few questions in the chat already or in the uh sheet. So if you guys got on there while we were presenting and tried to log in to your Renaissance, you probably found that you don't have the Renaissance app. That's ok. Don't panic, do not submit a ticket and they're still loading. So there is, and I linked it in the Q and A sheet. There is an actual system support page that you guys can see the loading status of different curriculums of different programs. Um And star is one of those that they are still loading students. So have no fear it will be loaded before you guys start taking benchmarks. But also don't panic if you don't see it yet, just keep checking back here and there and when it's green, it's all good to go and you guys can get in the name of your Renaissance app. Thank you Ben. All right guys. That's all we have for you today. So thank you again for joining us and we will see you next time.\"), (2103, 747, 5014, \"All right, happy Tuesday guys. We're happy to see you guys for our fundamental training. Um We kinda have a big week this week. We have, um, today we're gonna go over mostly assessments and um those type of things. And then Thursday we're gonna have a good training with our um tech TV SS on our school and some of those things. So that's gonna be a really um informational, good day to come to too. Um, a few reminders for today, we have our Q and A sheet, we'll put um the link to at the end. So if you have questions, you can type them in there and we will answer them like we have been. Um and then um reminder for virtual etiquette, make sure you have your camera on. You're um sitting up um make sure you're focused and um paying attention to our training today. And um what else? And then just a reminder to keep checking Epic one. It's such a good resource and I know in my small groups we've gone through how to just search for random things and look for things. If you just search in that search bar at the top. There's so many good things you can find and all the resources and information that you could need. Um So those are just a few reminders for this morning. And um yeah, we'll go ahead and get started. So this is week four. I can't believe next week is our last week of summer training and then the week after that is um school starting. So it's just crazy how fast it's gone and it's been a great summer with you guys. So this is week four assessment. So we're gonna go over clever sign on benchmarking star and then performance matters with you guys for today and a reminder, we'll send all these slides and all the recording and everything to you um following this training from our teacher development email. So you guys will have that handy and you guys can look for the resources. All right, we'll go ahead and get started with Clever sign on. So Clever Sso stands for a single sign on. All right. So what is clever? So you've probably heard us talk about Clever. Um So what is it? It is a single sign on that enables Epic teachers, students and staff. So everybody basically at Epic to securely authenticate and log into connected applications via the Clever portal. Um So users log in to Clever just with one set of credentials, then they click on various app icons to automatically log into platforms via single sign on So you and your students can sign on the clever one, sign on and then you'll be able to go to all these different programs. So, if you have your students in their core curriculum there, they can click on their co curriculum and be able to find it. If you have supplemental curriculums, you can find those in there. Normally too, you can add other things that you need in there that your, um, students might be working on or they might need. So it's just really nice because it's a one stop shop for all the things that they might need to log into. And it's just easy because I just have to remember, log in for one thing rather than a million because I know I forget my passwords all the time for all the different things that we have passwords for these days. All right. So a few clever highlights. So it offers teachers and students the simple secure login experience. So it's secure. Um, you log in with your Google stuff. So it makes it real easy. Um It's the one stop shop that houses digital learning curriculum supplements and resources. There's so many things in there and then it saves time by allowing the users the ability to log in to one platform to seamlessly visit the various applications necessary. So it's just one spot that they can add into. All right, and then the students can find everything in one place. So this is what it looks like from the from their view. And its districts specify the right resources for each class based on the data from the cyst. So that's our student information system. So um Epic will have certain ones that will come on and I mean certain applications that will load automatically into clever. So those will be there. Um You can add even more classroom resources. So there's ones that will automatically be loaded. But if you wanna add some different ones, you can do that. Um There's a search bar and you can search for different programs and things that you might wanna add and then students are able to quickly immerse themselves in digital learning. So like in the past, with Epic, we would give our students a whole login sheet of stuff like there's this curriculum and how to log in, here's this curriculum and how to log in. Now, they can just log in a clever and like 99% of their curriculum will be in this one spot rather than them having to remember a million sign in. So they can easily get into their school work for the day without having a second guess. How do I get in there? Where is my curriculum? How do I log in? But all right. So how do you access Clever. So this is the link on the right side of this screen. So teachers and students access Clever with that link. Um It'll look like this picture on the left. So you just log in with your Google. Um And it's real easy, kind of like we do with most of our things at Epic. It's just a Google sign in it makes it real simple. Um And so that's the link right there. And I'm gonna show you on the next few slides how to um some other ways to find that link. So you don't have to have that saved right there. So where is the link? No worries. So if you go to your Epic One page again, like I said at the beginning, Epic One has a million different resources and things that are real handy for us. So if you go to the launcher on the top right page or top right of your page on Epic One, it's that little rocket ship. If you click that, then you can go down and you will find the clever login. So you see right there under the bamboo is the clever login. Um And you can notice also that the fresh service can be accessed there as well. So that's our ticketing where you can ask questions um whenever you're having issues with anything, um you can see fresh services there also. So that's one spot you can find the uh link for Clever. Another way is via the Bookmark Bar. So hopefully, everybody by this point has that staff links um on the Bookmark Bar. I know a bunch of us had that issue at the beginning, but it should be fixed hopefully. Now, um, so you can click that and go down to that curriculum logins and then Clever will be right there as well. That's the way I normally access it just because it's the easiest and it's always right there for me. So I go down to curriculum logins and then Clever and that's the same way your students will find it as well. They'll go to curriculum and then they'll go to Clever. And then if you want, you can also create a bookmark and put it on your own bookmark. If you would like to do that, if you don't wanna have to click those three ways. All right. So log in and portal. So upon logging in, each user will see their own portal. So when homeroom is selected, the following things will be displayed. So teacher pages, favorites, district core curricula, supplemental apps, Google apps and staff resources. Um So you can use your landing page to best suit your individual needs. You can kind of edit it and you can favorite some. And so you can see on that little picture right there, there's a favorites one. So you can start the ones that you use most often and they'll go right to that spot. Um And you can have quick access to the app. So you'll have all the apps listed here that any of your students are using um, your students won't have as many as you because they'll just have the ones they're in. But you have all of them there, which is really nice. So if you have a bunch of students in one, you can favorite it. Put it at that spot, make it real easy to find and, um, access. All right. Ok. So, feature information. These are all really handy links. We're not gonna click through them, but they are really handy. And um if you're having issues with any of these things, I just want to find out more about any of these. Um So the clever portal, if you have questions about teacher pages, how to add applications, um sending messages or announcements and then analytics. So if you need to learn more about um figuring out the analytics of, did my student log in? How long did they log in for all those information? So these are just resources that are real handy and you can um pull up if you need to find out more information about those. All right, login issues. So again, if you're having login issues, we're gonna go to that fresh service ticket to the SSS department. So you can go to that launcher and go to fresh service. Um And that's one of one way you can find that you can also do it again. And the staff links on the left, there's lots of options. You can kind of figure out a pattern that most of our important, um, links and things are in those two spots. So they're kind of easy to find. Um So you'll click fresh service and then once you're there, you're gonna do a ticket to system support and they'll help you be able to log in. Um, hopefully you don't have login issues. But if you do, that's the way to the way to handle it. And then clever support. I have found this clever support to be actually one of the more helpful um like support pages on any website that I've seen. So if you click that question mark at the top and you can go to help center, it will pop up like a little, it's almost like a chat box, but it's not really chatting with a real person. But if you type your issue, it normally will pull up your issue immediately like a website or how to steps or whatever. And it's super helpful on um whatever issue you might be having. Um So that's one way if you're having a, have a question or wanna figure something out quick, you can use that help center. Um And let's see. And then there's the clever support website that has all sorts of stuff that you need. And then quick guides on Clever Academy is there as well. And then teachers can find these links also by clicking on the icon on the blue navigation bar, um Help center and Clever Academy So that's that question mark. I was just talking about this will be there. All right, I'm gonna pass it over to Miss Betty B for some benchmarking. OK. We get to talk about benchmarking. I know that this is probably something that you guys have talked about in your principal groups or you've heard that teachers talking about? Um I know some of my teachers have asked, can we go ahead and start scheduling benchmark testing? So I think that kind of depends more on your principal and your team and what you're wanting if you're going to those I LP S, if they're wanting you to go ahead and schedule those benchmarks, um even though you don't really know anything because we're just now hitting the training on it, um You can still schedule them because we have a benchmark window that we'll talk about in these slides. Ok. So first things first, who is required to take this, our pre K through first graders over here? Um Pre K does not have to take it during this first window. So this first fall window, pre K does not have to take it at all. Um When their window opens in the winter, they will take start early literacy. That being said, you're more than welcome to give them the start early literacy. If you're wanting to give them something to have like a starting base of where they're at, you're more than welcome. It's just not mandatory and then kindergarten are going are going to take the early star literacy and then first grades taking star, early literacy and math. Then our second through eighth graders are taking star math, not early literacy, but star math and reading. And then our high school students are not required to take benchmarks. We are wanting to focus on um their ac T prep. So just because they're not required to take benchmarks doesn't mean that you can't use a tool to assess where they're at. And there are tools and options available in your school home room that you can see where your high school students are and then how to access this. This is again in your clever. So what Susie touched on before that handy dandy, everything you need to sign into all these fun programs are in your clever account. So you'll go to your Clever and log in and then there's an app and it's gonna be under the big R Renaissance app. And then you can see after you click that on step three that there's the star early literacy, the star, reading the star Math, and then proctoring those benchmarks. We want to make sure that we are with our students. When they are taking this benchmark. We don't want to just say, hey, here's your benchmark. They wanna take it and we wanna be there. We wanna Proctor, we wanna make sure that they are doing their best their first time. This is a, a way for us to see where our students are. Currently. A lot of these students you guys are getting or all of them really? You guys are new teachers that you don't know anything about these kids. You don't know where they're at, where, where they're may be struggling. And so when you start talking about supplements and things like that, you don't really know what to get that student yet until we take this benchmark. So it's highly encouraged to make sure that they do their best. That way, we have a really good picture of where they're at and discuss that with the families. Let them know what this benchmark is for and why it's important that they do their best, um and make sure that the student is in their own account, not. And sometimes if you're using your own computer, you might have a student log in from it or something like that. So just double check and make sure that it's the student that's in there taking the correct test, we cannot delete assessment. So after an assessment is done, that is in there forever, we can't go back and delete that. Um, if you're with the ears and you're doing it in a group, it is a verbal test. So we wanna make sure that they have headsets. Um If you're doing a one on one that's fine, make sure it's in a quiet room where they can hear that verbal um information being presented in that test and then assessments are password protected. You will generate this yourself as a teacher and we have a document of how to do that. And we're gonna talk about that here in a minute too. But, um, the star passwords are created by you and then all star benchmarks must be Proctor in person, as I said, um, students are gonna log in and you guys will instruct them. It's the same thing. They're gonna go through the clever, it's really easy. Um But just make sure that you schedule a time with them that you can meet in person, you can do a group or you can do one on one. And then the setting is really the key to having a successful testing environment. Um You wanna consider these options, you want to consider the setting of where you are going to be at. Is it going to be at a coffee shop library or the student's home? Is the library your local library loud? I know mine is. So that wasn't always the best option for me, especially if maybe the family brought siblings, it tended to get really, really loud. Um So just kind of be mindful of that. You want the student to be able to work in an environment where they can focus and there's no distractions and then determine is it group or individual? If you're testing in a group of students, how are you going to have the students log in. Are you going to stagger? Are you going to have them all do it at the same time as you walk them through it and kind of some things to think about and talk to your T DS about those kinds of helpful hints. And then do you need to do individual testing? I know again, like I said, you don't know your students yet that you might decide to do group this time and then you might have a couple that you're like, oh, I'm gonna do one on one next time because that did not go over very well. So some do well in groups and some maybe we need to do one on one and then definitely don't wait until the last minute to schedule benchmarks. I know that we have a window just because we have that window doesn't mean waiting till the end of the window to schedule. You wanna do it as early in the window that you can. Um really that window is for the towards the end is to be able to do your reschedules. If you have kiddos who couldn't make the first scheduled meeting, then we have time to reschedule or um maybe we get students who are enrolled later on, then we wanna benchmark them in that window, but we can have them at the end. Don't save all your kiddos for the end and there will be rescheduled. I will say that so prepare for that. Ok. So we're gonna dive in a little bit and look at this benchmark schedule. This will be linked here in the presentation as well. Um But this is the yearly, the overall year benchmark schedule for you guys. So you can see that first column, August 14th through September 1st is our first benchmark window. And over there to the left pre K is not required and then you'll see kindergarten, kindergarten through third startler literacy and then it says, please see CBM, the guidance tab for additional information. So you can see down at the bottom, there's AC BM requirement tab. So make sure you look at that tab and, and review that, that way, you know what that is talking about. There's also an OAP tab so that if you have OAP students, what their requirements are and then kind of get ahead and look, look at what the next window is. Our next window is November 27th through December 15th. So as we get closer to that window and you guys are doing meetups, it might be good to start scheduling that ahead of time. Um Things change, their schedules will change and that's fine. But if you can have something on your calendar and on your book and then make those adjustments as needed, it just helps you guys get ahead of the game. So definitely refer back to this beco be aware of the upcoming benchmark windows, ok? So high school benchmarks, like we said, they are not required this year. Um High school benchmark tests will still be available for teachers and families who are wanting to take them and those can be accessed in your school homeroom and the high school students will all have their own home room that they can access those. Um instead of benchmarks, we're having students complete their AC T prep courses, they will be working out of either Alex, no red ink or Magus depending on what grade level that they're in. Exemptions for any AC T prep course will only be given to those students who have national AC T test of 22 or above in English reading and Math and they must also have an MD I approval and then there's also a diagnostic test available in the red ink. The initial placement test will be of value in Alex and teachers should assign practice AC T test in the goose to prepare students for the AC T test. April some other assessments to be mindful of for our high school kiddos. We do us citizen and ology homeroom. The US citizenship test will be open in October and students must have the study guide for at least 30 days before taking that test and then practice AC T benchmarks are again and homework. So let's talk through some comment, benchmark, frequently asked questions. Can I give a benchmark at an I LP meeting? No, that's the short answer. Um, long answer is it takes at least 48 hours for that student's information to roll over into the system. Therefore, they're not gonna be set up, um, to log in and take their benchmark. We encourage teachers to schedule a separate meeting. You can schedule those benchmark meetings while you're at the I LP meeting. So while you're there, you have the family there, you can say, hey, our benchmark window is at this time. What would be a good day for you to come and meet up for benchmarks and you might give them just a couple day options or maybe that first week option maybe don't tell them the whole window so that they don't schedule themselves for the last week as well. Um Can students take their test on a mobile device? No, these assessments must be taken on a laptop or a chromebook phones and ipads will not work for it and students can take assessments on a PC or Apple computers, but again, no tablets or mobile devices and then my student's computer died slash reset. Had the connection interrupted during the test. What do I do? Star actually saves the students work in progress. So the students should be able to log right back in and start where they left off. The question itself may be different but the progress is saved. Then what do I do? If a student enrolls during a benchmark window, they will have to participate in that benchmark window, whatever window it is that they're enrolled in. So if you do have a student who enrolls and it is like you're at the very end of that benchmark window, it's really important that maybe you set up that I LP meeting, but also the benchmark meeting as you're doing that too. And how do I, what do I do? Sorry, what do I do if a student enrolls between benchmark windows? So between benchmark windows, new students should be benchmarked within 10 days of the I LP completion. So maybe we've already ended this first benchmark and you get a new student, we don't want to just not give them one because it's not required. We still, the whole purpose of the benchmarks is to see where our student is. So we have no way of knowing where our student is unless we give them that benchmark. So even though it's out of the benchmark within the 1st 10 days, we want to give them a benchmark. So we can figure out what the learning plan for that student would be. Are there any exceptions for taking benchmark tests? No, all students in pre K through eight must be benchmark. Um This is also stated on the I LP whenever you meet with the family. So maybe this is something that you really hit on in your expectations is, hey, we, we require these benchmarks, they're gonna happen these time frames. You guys have that schedule um and also let them know the state testing for your state test kiddos. But these help us um we have practice AC T bench marks available as well and it just helps uh parents prepare for those national and state tests. So let's do a quick review because that's a lot. Um So high school students again are not required to benchmark. We are offering them a CD benchmarks if they want to for practice. And then pre K is not required for the first window, one K through eight. But you can still give your pre K just, you don't have to um testing takes place in the Star app found under the Renaissance app in Clever and Windows are only three weeks long. So plan accordingly, don't wait until the last week. An optional fourth window for showing growth for students is available and then optional progress monitoring the entire year. So you don't have to just give this one test and be done. You can go back and give them this test over and over again if you wanna monitor their growth throughout the school year, but you just have to give it at least in the benchmark window. All right hand this over to Kaitlyn. Thank you, Betty. And so uh Betty just covered our benchmark and what we give. So now we're gonna dig a little bit deeper into Star and actually how to give that assessment and how it's built and created because I know some of you, if you don't have an early childhood background, you've probably never seen the star or given the star before. And so that was me coming into epic with a high school background. And so we want to make sure that you guys understand what the star assessment is actually doing with your students, but also how to prepare yourself for giving that in a proper manner as well. So what is Star and the Star assessment are short tests that provide teachers with learning data and they are adaptive to students and they adjust um to each answer your student provides and this helps teachers get data that is best to help students in the shortest amount of time and that is very reliable in their results. So um just so you guys know in your planning and each step, our test is roughly about 20 to 30 minutes depending on your student and their ability and they are um short and condensed and like I mentioned, they are adaptive. So as your student continues to answers, answer questions correctly, they are going to adapt up in level. Um And as they or if they reverse of that, they are answering them incorrectly, it will adapt to lower standards. So keep that in mind and that's why we always say it's best practice to proctor these in person and really monitor these students. So you can understand where their deficits are and where their achievements are as well. So no matter what test you take in star, it's adaptive like I mentioned previously and it will alter the progression of questions based on how the student answers. So it is extremely important that because this test is adaptive that we do not help students at all. And this needs to be communicated to parents as well. We all know that we want our, our parents want their Children to succeed. So it's super easy for a mom to sit next to them and say, oh, remember we've talked about this or oh, look at all of your answers. We appreciate parents and their willingness to help their students succeed. But we want to see truly what the student knows and how we are going to plan accordingly to teach them individually for the rest of that school year. And so because that star is adaptive again, we want to communicate to all parties that are in the room taking that test at that time that they have to do it on their own in their own um capabilities. And we don't want to provide false information and to the algorithm that star uses. And we don't want that to change the difficulty of the test. Remember, we talked about how it is adaptive and progressive. So if a student is getting help and they're getting answers correct, it's just gonna continue to get harder and harder and more frustrating for that student when they are actually doing work on their own. So keep that in mind. Um, again, be best practice and something that I always used as a teacher with my students is mom and dad. I'm just gonna keep them for 30 minutes. You can take brother or sister over to the playground next door or whatever that looks like. And in the facility that you're giving this test in that way you can properly monitor your students without any distractions at all. But again, here, we're looking at our students knowledge sting. Um And so we just want to evaluate them and see exactly where they are in order to continue on with their education journey after this assessment is given. So you will be giving based on your roster several different types of tests. So we want you to make sure we want to make sure, excuse me that you understand, kind of what they look like that way you're prepared for when you give these tests to your students the first time. So your star early lit is for pre K starting in the winter window all the way through first grade. So your kindergarten through first grade students will be taking it in this first window and there's approximately 27 questions and based on your students ability, it could be 15 to 20 minutes. And so keep that in mind every student is different. So it's always important to schedule a good 30 minute windows for these kiddos. To get them in, get them logged in, get them prepared and set up for the test and then appropriate amount of time to complete the test. And so there is a time limit of 90 seconds per question on that star early lit. And so what that looks like is there is 90 seconds per question. And if your student is getting close to that 92nd mark, there will be a timer and that counts down for that student. And if they do not answer the question in that appropriate amount of time, then it will just move on. Um And it will, it will, what's the word I'm looking for? Um It will assume that that student got it incorrect because there was no given answer and then it will adapt based on that. So sometimes this can be a trigger for students. It could be nerve wracking, but just remind your students to do their absolute best. And um you know, if they don't know something, we don't just want them clicking to guess. We want them to try and then go from there. Um With our early lit this does read questions to the students and it is audible like Betty said, we wanna make sure that they have headphones um and that they are prepared for that in the type of setting you're giving it. And so there is an option to repeat those questions. Um And it will do that automatically after. So many seconds have gone. So just be prepared. This is only on that early lit test and that it will provide that student with the audio and questions. So then we move on to the star reading test for our second through eighth grade students. And this test is a little bit longer. Our kids have a little bit more of an attention span. So there's roughly 34 adaptive questions and this one will last 25 to 30 minutes. And again, this varies on students. Um If they are a high performing student and they are answering questions a lot faster, then they're gonna get through this assessment faster or vice versa. It may take them that entire 30 minute time to complete this assessment. And so the time limit varies from 45 seconds to two minutes depending on the grade level and the question in each section in that star reading test. And so practice questions will start at the very beginning and this will be something that you as the teacher are able to guide them through with those practice questions to ensure that they know how to complete the test appropriately. Um These practice questions do not count towards their overall data that we are taking from the test. Um But it is important that the student knows exactly how to navigate how to answer the questions appropriately. And keep in mind some of these students, if it's their first time with Epic, they may be using a chromebook for the first time and they may need a mouse to work with because they've never used the little pad um on a chromebook and every student is a little bit different. So keep these things in mind before you're going into these assessments as well because that might be something that you work with the student on before we do these practice questions. And that way when they get to the practice question, they can start answering them with more confidence. And we're not stressed out about not knowing how to use that pad on the chromebook or the mouse depending on which you have provided for them or they have. So keep that in mind. And if a student cannot independently complete the practice questions, we still want to move them through them to give that star early literacy test. We do have students that may not be able to answer some of those practice questions. And we want you as the facilitator to help them get through the practice questions um if they are needing help, but as soon as that actual assessment starts, they need to independently complete the rest of the start early literacy test. So keep in mind, this is mainly for your um lower functioning kiddos, your of kids, things like that and those kids that are unable to fully function and understand how to get through those practice questions. That's when you as the teacher can help um outside of that, again, just use your best judgment when getting them through the practice questions. And if they have been with us at Epic before, they've taken this assessment before multiple times. So it's familiar to them. And ideally if they aren't from Epic in their um in early childhood, they have taken it as well at another school. So um just keep that in mind. But again, if they need assistance, you can only help them during those practice questions. So keep that in mind. And then also for our first through eighth graders, they take the star math. Um So again, keep in mind your first through eighth graders, they're gonna be taking both reading and math or early lit and math. So keep in mind um when you're scheduling these, it's not just one or the other, it's gonna be both and how you schedule that with your families is up to you and some students, their attention span is that 30 minutes and they're done for the day. And so kind of keep that in mind and take that judgment into consider consideration whenever you are at that IOP meeting, meeting the family for the first time. And, and you can always change your mind, you can take one assessment and if that student is ready and they still have some motivation to continue on to the next go for it. If they don't, then maybe we wanna reschedule and do it again. The next day or go take a, a brain break, let them play outside for a little bit and then come back and complete the other assessment. So just any of those scenarios can happen and they will happen. So just keep thinking about those as you are getting to know these families and what can your student handle in an appropriate setting? Um But in that math and again, this is for first through eighth graders, there's 34 adaptive questions. So again, um if a student's taking both tests, they're gonna be doing 68 questions total. So just keep that in mind when planning and this one just like the reading is approximately 25 to 30 minutes in length and their time limit is three minutes per question. And so again, that timer will be going and count down for them when they get close to that three minute mark and students will log in through their clever and use the Renaissance app like Betty discussed earlier and then the password um is admin and you again, as the teacher will have the right to set that and make it whatever you want. And our ELC training um actually walks you through that, that you're gonna be watching this week. So, um when you're going through that ELC training, that will take you through the specific steps to get you to that um password guide. And so on our next slide, we actually have that link um we're not gonna go into um a ton of detail on this, but I do want you guys to see kind of what it looks like. But again, this is how you as the teacher are going to set that star password for your students and this will be set and all of your students will use it. Um So just keep in mind something that's simple. Um But following the guidelines as well, um so this will be given to you in the ELC. But again, um you will have control over this um and your own, you'll get to monitor this password so you can change it each window and keep it the same throughout. It is up to you, you get to monitor that. Um But this will all be done within that Renaissance app um before you go give the star test, so best practice would be that you have all of this set before you go give that first star assessment to your first student that you're benchmarking. Um So this is something that you will do prior to meeting your students for their benchmark and um navigating through that Renaissance Bar at the top and under your name, there's a drop down a little carrot that will take you and to where you need to go and edit preferences. And so in that drop down, you'll select edit preferences and then from your preferences, you are going to go to your classrooms. And so the class preference and then monitor password star test is what we're looking for there. And again, you guys will have access to these slides and these links. Um If you don't get all of these steps today, it's also in the ELC that is gonna be um delivered to you guys tomorrow in that platform. So just keep in mind you will set that password for whatever you want it to be. And then that is what you're going to use to log in for your students to take their assessment. All right. So some common questions um and answers over our star and so can I read a star math allowed to my students? And your answer is if you have a struggling reader and that pivots from the star reading to take star early literacy, the early literacy test, the student must take the star math if they're in grades one and up. Um in these cases, it's allowed to utilize the read, allow feature in star. And so all students taking the star early literacy can have math read allowed if deemed necessary. Um And so what this is referring to is um Betty discussed the benchmark sheet. It's kind of a cheat sheet for you guys. Um And then it went into the CBM guidelines. And so what that looks like is if and, and we'll go into further detail uh and a further training on this, but based on their score um in the star reading, they may have to go again and take that star early literacy test. Um And if they take that star early literacy test, then they will have that read aloud feature um if it's deemed necessary. So keep that in mind, um we will give further training on that at a later date when it's closer to time. Another question is, can a student use a personal ipad to do the star bench mark? Yes, they can. And the student will need to ensure that they have downloaded and installed the Clever app and then sign in with their school account. And so it may be their personal ipad, but it has to be logged in through all of our epic information. And this is the only way that they'll have access to everything that they need in order to be successful to take their star. And again, Betty mentioned earlier chromebooks, laptops are the easiest way and you providing that for your students. Um But if they happen to have a, a school ipad or their own that they use on a daily basis, especially your, your kindergarteners and possibly some first graders if they've been with us and they have ipads, they do have access to those and use and can use those. And we just prefer for the older grades to use those chromebooks. So keep that in mind. Um What do I do if my student cannot make it past the practice questions we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier. Um but the practice questions do not count in the student score. Therefore, you may have to help the student complete the practice questions in order to advance them to the actual test. If the student is struggling reading or a sped student with accommodations, be sure to have the conversation with your principal about whether giving the star early literacy test to the student would be most appropriate. And so in these cases, according to RS A guidelines, we have to give the student the required assessment first for their grade level. Um even if it is an O A student. So if we have a third grade o A student, we still need to give that third grade OAP student that star reading test first based on their ability. Remember those questions will adapt for that student and um you may help them get through that practice, but we wanna see their actual knowledge because this um this data is also reported to the state for RS A purposes. Um but again, if that student is, is truly struggling and they cannot make it through that um star reading and it finally kind of closes out because they're not answering questions and they are not capable of answering questions, then discuss with your principal of conversation of giving them that early literacy test followed. And that way we can truly get some data as to what they do know. Um but again, they have to take the grade level required assessment first and then we can move down to something lower if needed or appropriate for the student. And so again, we can't forget about that dyslexia House Bill 28 04. We talked about this last week. And so this is referred to as the star CBM. And it, it does not provide a diagnosis for dyslexia. This is only a tool to help provide appropriate instruction for students. And this is required by law and it will be reported with RS A data during the year. And so again, this is one of those things that if um your student school below a specific percentile on their star reading or early literacy, you will then be required to give them this CBM screener and all of it is housed within the same Renaissance App. Um And as you uh let me see if I can go back to that slide where it shows um it does have all of it listed in your Renaissance. I'm sorry, I can't find it right now. But um when you open that up, it is there for you and um then you can see the star reading star math early lit and then there's an option for the star CV M. So keep that in mind um on our next slide, it does tell us um those kindergartners, we're not gonna look at that CBM until the winter window. Um but if they score below 40th percentile on their early literacy test, then they will be required to take the CBM and they will be taking the rapid color naming portion of that CBM. And if you have a first grader, the scores below the 40th percentile, and that's kind of the key percentile to think about. If the student scores below that 40th percentile on that first grade level assessment, then we're gonna drop it down to a lower assessment. And since star early literacy is the low one, we have our first graders will go straight to that Star CBM as well as those kindergartners um and take the appropriate CBM screener. And so for first grade, it's gonna be expressive nonsense words and rapid name coloring. And but then second grade, remember they start at the star reading and so if they score below grade level, which is below the 40th percentile, then we would give them the star early literacy test. If they continue to score below the 40th percentile on that star early literacy, then we go to the Star CBM Screener where they will take expressive nonsense words in rapid name, uh color naming and same thing with third grade. And that star reading, that's where they start at below 40th percentile. They go to early literacy below 40th percentile on that. Then they go to the Star CBM and this is something that is just for the reading portion of our star and it will not be done on math because again, that's completely different subject. So keep that in mind and there is a possibility that you are gonna have to assess a student on all three of those and different star assessments. So keep that in mind. Ok, a few things to consider with your star CBM. Um first through third grade students, um the star CBM must be given within 30 days of completion of the benchmark, but no later than November 1st in order to comply with RS A law. And so again, if you see in those results and that data given to you from the star that they are in that below 40 percentile, we need a automatically schedule a time to give them that Star CBM within 30 days and sooner the better is, is kind of best practice. So um students that come to us after November 1st and they will still be required to take both the star tests and, and if they qualify, they will take that Star CBM to pro to progress, monitor them. And so again, that's just just like a late enrolling. If they come to us after November 1st, that deadline, we want to still follow those same processes, one to see where they are as a learner. And so you can individualize their education. But also, and we just wanna make sure that we are monitoring them and able to teach the best we can to their specific needs. And so those are those guidelines you'll follow for kindergarten, kindergarten students and they must be given that star CBM within 30 days as well of the winter benchmark. Um So keep in mind our kindergarteners, you're just giving that star early lit. And um that's what they're gonna take in this window. We don't have to look at that percentile until after we have taught them a little bit to see where they are at. So in that winter window, that is when we will look at their percentile. If they are below 40 percentile, we will give them that CBM. Um It is best practice to give the star CBM immediately after star bench marking, if the student scored in the 39th percentile or below. And in that event, your student, your your star scores are not immediately available. Star CBM must be given within those 30 days. So you will also be taught how to pull reports. So you can look at this data and and see how to read what percentile they are in, I promise you. Ok. So we are going to move away from star and for a moment and we are going to go into performance matters. And so what is performance matters? Um Performance matters is an eae a epic data warehouse. And so this is a platform that you guys will get to through Clever as well or no, sorry, excuse me, through your power school. Um And this is going to be a, just a good place for you to look at data on your student. And so you will log in to performance matters through Power School. And in power school, you have a little waffle, um or checkerboard, whatever you call it in that top right corner of your screen. And from there that drop down, you will select the performance matters option. Um A dashboard is what you will see once you log in. And so you will have a dashboard of all of your students. And so these icons over here that are blurred out, those are your students and their names and their grades that they are in. And from there, you can select a specific student and you can go into specific courses or um I'm sorry, subjects in order to see data based on the assessment that they've taken and any detailed information that they have um completed with you. And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna look at test results. And so this is to view formative and so the formative will be housed in your Epic Ed platform and for your students that are in grades pre K through T and and then that the formative are basically their standard based assessments. And so the data that you wanna look at is after they've completed those formative, then you'll go to performance matters to look at those um all in one place. So to view formative or common. Um, you're gonna go to uh state test scores and benchmarks. Um This will give you additional scores for the student again based on the assessments they have taken with you um inside Epic Ed and outside. Um So within performance matters, you have access to a baseball card report and this report is going to be helpful for you and it is a navigation tool um on the menu in the left, you'll choose reports and then baseball card report. And so this is going to be something that um if you are grouping students or even just looking at a student individually for their needs, and this will give you that data. So this next picture that we're gonna show and gives you a little glimpse of what that baseball card looks like, but you have your students and their student ID and grade level, um and then you will have specific standards listed out on this baseball card and you can customize this baseball card by grade level. And so you're looking at one grade level across the board or all of your students on the roster at once. You can choose that on your own. And most of this data will be coming from principals and principals will most likely share these baseball card reports with you. And as they're tracking data throughout the. And so again, these are results from those students formative as you can see, they will highlight by color based on how that student does on those assessments. Um Obviously, if there's no color, they haven't completed that one yet. So this is just a good way and to help keep you accountable with tracking those formative the students are doing and as they go throughout the school year, and again, this will be discussed more on a principle by principle basis. And every principal kind of gives a different directive on these and how to go about these. So if you have questions, reach out to your TV S or your principal on those topics, OK. So the formative that are found within performance matters are the high school formative that are in theology home room and they will go into performance matters. So if you are wanting to assess those high schoolers and as they are getting prepared to, to learn a little bit more about them, that data will be shown and as well as third through eighth grades will take graders will take their first formative through Epic Ed. And if that standard is not mastered, then the teacher could reteach and then give formative b in the school home room. And so you have several options for students to complete these formative. And again, these formative are covering specific standards throughout the year. Um So you'll teach, they'll practice and then as you assess, you're gonna assess them using these formative. Um the first formative again, like I mentioned will be given through epi um but if we didn't show mastery on that, we need to go back and reteach, they can have a second option. Um We can't reset them with an EIC. So they have housed a formative B option inside your home room and you can give it a second, second time um with different questions um on the same standard that they needed retaught and then assessed again. So that is there for you. And um, we are going to be going into some of this school training and um in Power School on Thursday. So you will be getting training over those platforms as well. And um you will be able to grade open-ended response questions and evidence captures for high school formative and performance matters. And a lot of our high schoolers will be doing writing prompts um or like mentioned evidence captures where they have to attach and upload things that they have completed and this is where you are gonna go and you can grade those inside performance matters and just a few resources that we wanted to share with you guys. Um based off of today's um our Epic One assessments page, all things benchmarks, assessments will be on that page and these links will get you directly to that. Um The Epic One Star testing an informational page benchmark, frequently asked questions and the star testing checklist. And so again, we want to provide you guys with resources that will make it easier for you to remember all of this information that we are throwing at you. And so this is a great place to start when you're seeking some resources. And that is what we have for today. Um Again, our topics that we covered in today's training are clever sign on benchmarking star and performance matters. And in the chat box, you will find that Q and A document and please make sure that you're looking at the week four tab whenever you are putting questions on that Q and A sheet. Um Because that are, those are the questions referring back to today's training. So, um thank you guys for being here with us today and don't forget your small group Q and A s with your individual T DS teams that are on um tomorrow or Friday. And um if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach, hey, and I'm also gonna add before you guys go because there's quite a few questions in the chat already or in the uh sheet. So if you guys got on there while we were presenting and tried to log in to your Renaissance, you probably found that you don't have the Renaissance app. That's ok. Don't panic, do not submit a ticket and they're still loading. So there is, and I linked it in the Q and A sheet. There is an actual system support page that you guys can see the loading status of different curriculums of different programs. Um And star is one of those that they are still loading students. So have no fear it will be loaded before you guys start taking benchmarks. But also don't panic if you don't see it yet, just keep checking back here and there and when it's green, it's all good to go and you guys can get in the name of your Renaissance app. Thank you Ben. All right guys. That's all we have for you today. So thank you again for joining us and we will see you next time.\"), (2102, 747, 5014, \"All right, happy Tuesday guys. We're happy to see you guys for our fundamental training. Um We kinda have a big week this week. We have, um, today we're gonna go over mostly assessments and um those type of things. And then Thursday we're gonna have a good training with our um tech TV SS on our school and some of those things. So that's gonna be a really um informational, good day to come to too. Um, a few reminders for today, we have our Q and A sheet, we'll put um the link to at the end. So if you have questions, you can type them in there and we will answer them like we have been. Um and then um reminder for virtual etiquette, make sure you have your camera on. You're um sitting up um make sure you're focused and um paying attention to our training today. And um what else? And then just a reminder to keep checking Epic one. It's such a good resource and I know in my small groups we've gone through how to just search for random things and look for things. If you just search in that search bar at the top. There's so many good things you can find and all the resources and information that you could need. Um So those are just a few reminders for this morning. And um yeah, we'll go ahead and get started. So this is week four. I can't believe next week is our last week of summer training and then the week after that is um school starting. So it's just crazy how fast it's gone and it's been a great summer with you guys. So this is week four assessment. So we're gonna go over clever sign on benchmarking star and then performance matters with you guys for today and a reminder, we'll send all these slides and all the recording and everything to you um following this training from our teacher development email. So you guys will have that handy and you guys can look for the resources. All right, we'll go ahead and get started with Clever sign on. So Clever Sso stands for a single sign on. All right. So what is clever? So you've probably heard us talk about Clever. Um So what is it? It is a single sign on that enables Epic teachers, students and staff. So everybody basically at Epic to securely authenticate and log into connected applications via the Clever portal. Um So users log in to Clever just with one set of credentials, then they click on various app icons to automatically log into platforms via single sign on So you and your students can sign on the clever one, sign on and then you'll be able to go to all these different programs. So, if you have your students in their core curriculum there, they can click on their co curriculum and be able to find it. If you have supplemental curriculums, you can find those in there. Normally too, you can add other things that you need in there that your, um, students might be working on or they might need. So it's just really nice because it's a one stop shop for all the things that they might need to log into. And it's just easy because I just have to remember, log in for one thing rather than a million because I know I forget my passwords all the time for all the different things that we have passwords for these days. All right. So a few clever highlights. So it offers teachers and students the simple secure login experience. So it's secure. Um, you log in with your Google stuff. So it makes it real easy. Um It's the one stop shop that houses digital learning curriculum supplements and resources. There's so many things in there and then it saves time by allowing the users the ability to log in to one platform to seamlessly visit the various applications necessary. So it's just one spot that they can add into. All right, and then the students can find everything in one place. So this is what it looks like from the from their view. And its districts specify the right resources for each class based on the data from the cyst. So that's our student information system. So um Epic will have certain ones that will come on and I mean certain applications that will load automatically into clever. So those will be there. Um You can add even more classroom resources. So there's ones that will automatically be loaded. But if you wanna add some different ones, you can do that. Um There's a search bar and you can search for different programs and things that you might wanna add and then students are able to quickly immerse themselves in digital learning. So like in the past, with Epic, we would give our students a whole login sheet of stuff like there's this curriculum and how to log in, here's this curriculum and how to log in. Now, they can just log in a clever and like 99% of their curriculum will be in this one spot rather than them having to remember a million sign in. So they can easily get into their school work for the day without having a second guess. How do I get in there? Where is my curriculum? How do I log in? But all right. So how do you access Clever. So this is the link on the right side of this screen. So teachers and students access Clever with that link. Um It'll look like this picture on the left. So you just log in with your Google. Um And it's real easy, kind of like we do with most of our things at Epic. It's just a Google sign in it makes it real simple. Um And so that's the link right there. And I'm gonna show you on the next few slides how to um some other ways to find that link. So you don't have to have that saved right there. So where is the link? No worries. So if you go to your Epic One page again, like I said at the beginning, Epic One has a million different resources and things that are real handy for us. So if you go to the launcher on the top right page or top right of your page on Epic One, it's that little rocket ship. If you click that, then you can go down and you will find the clever login. So you see right there under the bamboo is the clever login. Um And you can notice also that the fresh service can be accessed there as well. So that's our ticketing where you can ask questions um whenever you're having issues with anything, um you can see fresh services there also. So that's one spot you can find the uh link for Clever. Another way is via the Bookmark Bar. So hopefully, everybody by this point has that staff links um on the Bookmark Bar. I know a bunch of us had that issue at the beginning, but it should be fixed hopefully. Now, um, so you can click that and go down to that curriculum logins and then Clever will be right there as well. That's the way I normally access it just because it's the easiest and it's always right there for me. So I go down to curriculum logins and then Clever and that's the same way your students will find it as well. They'll go to curriculum and then they'll go to Clever. And then if you want, you can also create a bookmark and put it on your own bookmark. If you would like to do that, if you don't wanna have to click those three ways. All right. So log in and portal. So upon logging in, each user will see their own portal. So when homeroom is selected, the following things will be displayed. So teacher pages, favorites, district core curricula, supplemental apps, Google apps and staff resources. Um So you can use your landing page to best suit your individual needs. You can kind of edit it and you can favorite some. And so you can see on that little picture right there, there's a favorites one. So you can start the ones that you use most often and they'll go right to that spot. Um And you can have quick access to the app. So you'll have all the apps listed here that any of your students are using um, your students won't have as many as you because they'll just have the ones they're in. But you have all of them there, which is really nice. So if you have a bunch of students in one, you can favorite it. Put it at that spot, make it real easy to find and, um, access. All right. Ok. So, feature information. These are all really handy links. We're not gonna click through them, but they are really handy. And um if you're having issues with any of these things, I just want to find out more about any of these. Um So the clever portal, if you have questions about teacher pages, how to add applications, um sending messages or announcements and then analytics. So if you need to learn more about um figuring out the analytics of, did my student log in? How long did they log in for all those information? So these are just resources that are real handy and you can um pull up if you need to find out more information about those. All right, login issues. So again, if you're having login issues, we're gonna go to that fresh service ticket to the SSS department. So you can go to that launcher and go to fresh service. Um And that's one of one way you can find that you can also do it again. And the staff links on the left, there's lots of options. You can kind of figure out a pattern that most of our important, um, links and things are in those two spots. So they're kind of easy to find. Um So you'll click fresh service and then once you're there, you're gonna do a ticket to system support and they'll help you be able to log in. Um, hopefully you don't have login issues. But if you do, that's the way to the way to handle it. And then clever support. I have found this clever support to be actually one of the more helpful um like support pages on any website that I've seen. So if you click that question mark at the top and you can go to help center, it will pop up like a little, it's almost like a chat box, but it's not really chatting with a real person. But if you type your issue, it normally will pull up your issue immediately like a website or how to steps or whatever. And it's super helpful on um whatever issue you might be having. Um So that's one way if you're having a, have a question or wanna figure something out quick, you can use that help center. Um And let's see. And then there's the clever support website that has all sorts of stuff that you need. And then quick guides on Clever Academy is there as well. And then teachers can find these links also by clicking on the icon on the blue navigation bar, um Help center and Clever Academy So that's that question mark. I was just talking about this will be there. All right, I'm gonna pass it over to Miss Betty B for some benchmarking. OK. We get to talk about benchmarking. I know that this is probably something that you guys have talked about in your principal groups or you've heard that teachers talking about? Um I know some of my teachers have asked, can we go ahead and start scheduling benchmark testing? So I think that kind of depends more on your principal and your team and what you're wanting if you're going to those I LP S, if they're wanting you to go ahead and schedule those benchmarks, um even though you don't really know anything because we're just now hitting the training on it, um You can still schedule them because we have a benchmark window that we'll talk about in these slides. Ok. So first things first, who is required to take this, our pre K through first graders over here? Um Pre K does not have to take it during this first window. So this first fall window, pre K does not have to take it at all. Um When their window opens in the winter, they will take start early literacy. That being said, you're more than welcome to give them the start early literacy. If you're wanting to give them something to have like a starting base of where they're at, you're more than welcome. It's just not mandatory and then kindergarten are going are going to take the early star literacy and then first grades taking star, early literacy and math. Then our second through eighth graders are taking star math, not early literacy, but star math and reading. And then our high school students are not required to take benchmarks. We are wanting to focus on um their ac T prep. So just because they're not required to take benchmarks doesn't mean that you can't use a tool to assess where they're at. And there are tools and options available in your school home room that you can see where your high school students are and then how to access this. This is again in your clever. So what Susie touched on before that handy dandy, everything you need to sign into all these fun programs are in your clever account. So you'll go to your Clever and log in and then there's an app and it's gonna be under the big R Renaissance app. And then you can see after you click that on step three that there's the star early literacy, the star, reading the star Math, and then proctoring those benchmarks. We want to make sure that we are with our students. When they are taking this benchmark. We don't want to just say, hey, here's your benchmark. They wanna take it and we wanna be there. We wanna Proctor, we wanna make sure that they are doing their best their first time. This is a, a way for us to see where our students are. Currently. A lot of these students you guys are getting or all of them really? You guys are new teachers that you don't know anything about these kids. You don't know where they're at, where, where they're may be struggling. And so when you start talking about supplements and things like that, you don't really know what to get that student yet until we take this benchmark. So it's highly encouraged to make sure that they do their best. That way, we have a really good picture of where they're at and discuss that with the families. Let them know what this benchmark is for and why it's important that they do their best, um and make sure that the student is in their own account, not. And sometimes if you're using your own computer, you might have a student log in from it or something like that. So just double check and make sure that it's the student that's in there taking the correct test, we cannot delete assessment. So after an assessment is done, that is in there forever, we can't go back and delete that. Um, if you're with the ears and you're doing it in a group, it is a verbal test. So we wanna make sure that they have headsets. Um If you're doing a one on one that's fine, make sure it's in a quiet room where they can hear that verbal um information being presented in that test and then assessments are password protected. You will generate this yourself as a teacher and we have a document of how to do that. And we're gonna talk about that here in a minute too. But, um, the star passwords are created by you and then all star benchmarks must be Proctor in person, as I said, um, students are gonna log in and you guys will instruct them. It's the same thing. They're gonna go through the clever, it's really easy. Um But just make sure that you schedule a time with them that you can meet in person, you can do a group or you can do one on one. And then the setting is really the key to having a successful testing environment. Um You wanna consider these options, you want to consider the setting of where you are going to be at. Is it going to be at a coffee shop library or the student's home? Is the library your local library loud? I know mine is. So that wasn't always the best option for me, especially if maybe the family brought siblings, it tended to get really, really loud. Um So just kind of be mindful of that. You want the student to be able to work in an environment where they can focus and there's no distractions and then determine is it group or individual? If you're testing in a group of students, how are you going to have the students log in. Are you going to stagger? Are you going to have them all do it at the same time as you walk them through it and kind of some things to think about and talk to your T DS about those kinds of helpful hints. And then do you need to do individual testing? I know again, like I said, you don't know your students yet that you might decide to do group this time and then you might have a couple that you're like, oh, I'm gonna do one on one next time because that did not go over very well. So some do well in groups and some maybe we need to do one on one and then definitely don't wait until the last minute to schedule benchmarks. I know that we have a window just because we have that window doesn't mean waiting till the end of the window to schedule. You wanna do it as early in the window that you can. Um really that window is for the towards the end is to be able to do your reschedules. If you have kiddos who couldn't make the first scheduled meeting, then we have time to reschedule or um maybe we get students who are enrolled later on, then we wanna benchmark them in that window, but we can have them at the end. Don't save all your kiddos for the end and there will be rescheduled. I will say that so prepare for that. Ok. So we're gonna dive in a little bit and look at this benchmark schedule. This will be linked here in the presentation as well. Um But this is the yearly, the overall year benchmark schedule for you guys. So you can see that first column, August 14th through September 1st is our first benchmark window. And over there to the left pre K is not required and then you'll see kindergarten, kindergarten through third startler literacy and then it says, please see CBM, the guidance tab for additional information. So you can see down at the bottom, there's AC BM requirement tab. So make sure you look at that tab and, and review that, that way, you know what that is talking about. There's also an OAP tab so that if you have OAP students, what their requirements are and then kind of get ahead and look, look at what the next window is. Our next window is November 27th through December 15th. So as we get closer to that window and you guys are doing meetups, it might be good to start scheduling that ahead of time. Um Things change, their schedules will change and that's fine. But if you can have something on your calendar and on your book and then make those adjustments as needed, it just helps you guys get ahead of the game. So definitely refer back to this beco be aware of the upcoming benchmark windows, ok? So high school benchmarks, like we said, they are not required this year. Um High school benchmark tests will still be available for teachers and families who are wanting to take them and those can be accessed in your school homeroom and the high school students will all have their own home room that they can access those. Um instead of benchmarks, we're having students complete their AC T prep courses, they will be working out of either Alex, no red ink or Magus depending on what grade level that they're in. Exemptions for any AC T prep course will only be given to those students who have national AC T test of 22 or above in English reading and Math and they must also have an MD I approval and then there's also a diagnostic test available in the red ink. The initial placement test will be of value in Alex and teachers should assign practice AC T test in the goose to prepare students for the AC T test. April some other assessments to be mindful of for our high school kiddos. We do us citizen and ology homeroom. The US citizenship test will be open in October and students must have the study guide for at least 30 days before taking that test and then practice AC T benchmarks are again and homework. So let's talk through some comment, benchmark, frequently asked questions. Can I give a benchmark at an I LP meeting? No, that's the short answer. Um, long answer is it takes at least 48 hours for that student's information to roll over into the system. Therefore, they're not gonna be set up, um, to log in and take their benchmark. We encourage teachers to schedule a separate meeting. You can schedule those benchmark meetings while you're at the I LP meeting. So while you're there, you have the family there, you can say, hey, our benchmark window is at this time. What would be a good day for you to come and meet up for benchmarks and you might give them just a couple day options or maybe that first week option maybe don't tell them the whole window so that they don't schedule themselves for the last week as well. Um Can students take their test on a mobile device? No, these assessments must be taken on a laptop or a chromebook phones and ipads will not work for it and students can take assessments on a PC or Apple computers, but again, no tablets or mobile devices and then my student's computer died slash reset. Had the connection interrupted during the test. What do I do? Star actually saves the students work in progress. So the students should be able to log right back in and start where they left off. The question itself may be different but the progress is saved. Then what do I do? If a student enrolls during a benchmark window, they will have to participate in that benchmark window, whatever window it is that they're enrolled in. So if you do have a student who enrolls and it is like you're at the very end of that benchmark window, it's really important that maybe you set up that I LP meeting, but also the benchmark meeting as you're doing that too. And how do I, what do I do? Sorry, what do I do if a student enrolls between benchmark windows? So between benchmark windows, new students should be benchmarked within 10 days of the I LP completion. So maybe we've already ended this first benchmark and you get a new student, we don't want to just not give them one because it's not required. We still, the whole purpose of the benchmarks is to see where our student is. So we have no way of knowing where our student is unless we give them that benchmark. So even though it's out of the benchmark within the 1st 10 days, we want to give them a benchmark. So we can figure out what the learning plan for that student would be. Are there any exceptions for taking benchmark tests? No, all students in pre K through eight must be benchmark. Um This is also stated on the I LP whenever you meet with the family. So maybe this is something that you really hit on in your expectations is, hey, we, we require these benchmarks, they're gonna happen these time frames. You guys have that schedule um and also let them know the state testing for your state test kiddos. But these help us um we have practice AC T bench marks available as well and it just helps uh parents prepare for those national and state tests. So let's do a quick review because that's a lot. Um So high school students again are not required to benchmark. We are offering them a CD benchmarks if they want to for practice. And then pre K is not required for the first window, one K through eight. But you can still give your pre K just, you don't have to um testing takes place in the Star app found under the Renaissance app in Clever and Windows are only three weeks long. So plan accordingly, don't wait until the last week. An optional fourth window for showing growth for students is available and then optional progress monitoring the entire year. So you don't have to just give this one test and be done. You can go back and give them this test over and over again if you wanna monitor their growth throughout the school year, but you just have to give it at least in the benchmark window. All right hand this over to Kaitlyn. Thank you, Betty. And so uh Betty just covered our benchmark and what we give. So now we're gonna dig a little bit deeper into Star and actually how to give that assessment and how it's built and created because I know some of you, if you don't have an early childhood background, you've probably never seen the star or given the star before. And so that was me coming into epic with a high school background. And so we want to make sure that you guys understand what the star assessment is actually doing with your students, but also how to prepare yourself for giving that in a proper manner as well. So what is Star and the Star assessment are short tests that provide teachers with learning data and they are adaptive to students and they adjust um to each answer your student provides and this helps teachers get data that is best to help students in the shortest amount of time and that is very reliable in their results. So um just so you guys know in your planning and each step, our test is roughly about 20 to 30 minutes depending on your student and their ability and they are um short and condensed and like I mentioned, they are adaptive. So as your student continues to answers, answer questions correctly, they are going to adapt up in level. Um And as they or if they reverse of that, they are answering them incorrectly, it will adapt to lower standards. So keep that in mind and that's why we always say it's best practice to proctor these in person and really monitor these students. So you can understand where their deficits are and where their achievements are as well. So no matter what test you take in star, it's adaptive like I mentioned previously and it will alter the progression of questions based on how the student answers. So it is extremely important that because this test is adaptive that we do not help students at all. And this needs to be communicated to parents as well. We all know that we want our, our parents want their Children to succeed. So it's super easy for a mom to sit next to them and say, oh, remember we've talked about this or oh, look at all of your answers. We appreciate parents and their willingness to help their students succeed. But we want to see truly what the student knows and how we are going to plan accordingly to teach them individually for the rest of that school year. And so because that star is adaptive again, we want to communicate to all parties that are in the room taking that test at that time that they have to do it on their own in their own um capabilities. And we don't want to provide false information and to the algorithm that star uses. And we don't want that to change the difficulty of the test. Remember, we talked about how it is adaptive and progressive. So if a student is getting help and they're getting answers correct, it's just gonna continue to get harder and harder and more frustrating for that student when they are actually doing work on their own. So keep that in mind. Um, again, be best practice and something that I always used as a teacher with my students is mom and dad. I'm just gonna keep them for 30 minutes. You can take brother or sister over to the playground next door or whatever that looks like. And in the facility that you're giving this test in that way you can properly monitor your students without any distractions at all. But again, here, we're looking at our students knowledge sting. Um And so we just want to evaluate them and see exactly where they are in order to continue on with their education journey after this assessment is given. So you will be giving based on your roster several different types of tests. So we want you to make sure we want to make sure, excuse me that you understand, kind of what they look like that way you're prepared for when you give these tests to your students the first time. So your star early lit is for pre K starting in the winter window all the way through first grade. So your kindergarten through first grade students will be taking it in this first window and there's approximately 27 questions and based on your students ability, it could be 15 to 20 minutes. And so keep that in mind every student is different. So it's always important to schedule a good 30 minute windows for these kiddos. To get them in, get them logged in, get them prepared and set up for the test and then appropriate amount of time to complete the test. And so there is a time limit of 90 seconds per question on that star early lit. And so what that looks like is there is 90 seconds per question. And if your student is getting close to that 92nd mark, there will be a timer and that counts down for that student. And if they do not answer the question in that appropriate amount of time, then it will just move on. Um And it will, it will, what's the word I'm looking for? Um It will assume that that student got it incorrect because there was no given answer and then it will adapt based on that. So sometimes this can be a trigger for students. It could be nerve wracking, but just remind your students to do their absolute best. And um you know, if they don't know something, we don't just want them clicking to guess. We want them to try and then go from there. Um With our early lit this does read questions to the students and it is audible like Betty said, we wanna make sure that they have headphones um and that they are prepared for that in the type of setting you're giving it. And so there is an option to repeat those questions. Um And it will do that automatically after. So many seconds have gone. So just be prepared. This is only on that early lit test and that it will provide that student with the audio and questions. So then we move on to the star reading test for our second through eighth grade students. And this test is a little bit longer. Our kids have a little bit more of an attention span. So there's roughly 34 adaptive questions and this one will last 25 to 30 minutes. And again, this varies on students. Um If they are a high performing student and they are answering questions a lot faster, then they're gonna get through this assessment faster or vice versa. It may take them that entire 30 minute time to complete this assessment. And so the time limit varies from 45 seconds to two minutes depending on the grade level and the question in each section in that star reading test. And so practice questions will start at the very beginning and this will be something that you as the teacher are able to guide them through with those practice questions to ensure that they know how to complete the test appropriately. Um These practice questions do not count towards their overall data that we are taking from the test. Um But it is important that the student knows exactly how to navigate how to answer the questions appropriately. And keep in mind some of these students, if it's their first time with Epic, they may be using a chromebook for the first time and they may need a mouse to work with because they've never used the little pad um on a chromebook and every student is a little bit different. So keep these things in mind before you're going into these assessments as well because that might be something that you work with the student on before we do these practice questions. And that way when they get to the practice question, they can start answering them with more confidence. And we're not stressed out about not knowing how to use that pad on the chromebook or the mouse depending on which you have provided for them or they have. So keep that in mind. And if a student cannot independently complete the practice questions, we still want to move them through them to give that star early literacy test. We do have students that may not be able to answer some of those practice questions. And we want you as the facilitator to help them get through the practice questions um if they are needing help, but as soon as that actual assessment starts, they need to independently complete the rest of the start early literacy test. So keep in mind, this is mainly for your um lower functioning kiddos, your of kids, things like that and those kids that are unable to fully function and understand how to get through those practice questions. That's when you as the teacher can help um outside of that, again, just use your best judgment when getting them through the practice questions. And if they have been with us at Epic before, they've taken this assessment before multiple times. So it's familiar to them. And ideally if they aren't from Epic in their um in early childhood, they have taken it as well at another school. So um just keep that in mind. But again, if they need assistance, you can only help them during those practice questions. So keep that in mind. And then also for our first through eighth graders, they take the star math. Um So again, keep in mind your first through eighth graders, they're gonna be taking both reading and math or early lit and math. So keep in mind um when you're scheduling these, it's not just one or the other, it's gonna be both and how you schedule that with your families is up to you and some students, their attention span is that 30 minutes and they're done for the day. And so kind of keep that in mind and take that judgment into consider consideration whenever you are at that IOP meeting, meeting the family for the first time. And, and you can always change your mind, you can take one assessment and if that student is ready and they still have some motivation to continue on to the next go for it. If they don't, then maybe we wanna reschedule and do it again. The next day or go take a, a brain break, let them play outside for a little bit and then come back and complete the other assessment. So just any of those scenarios can happen and they will happen. So just keep thinking about those as you are getting to know these families and what can your student handle in an appropriate setting? Um But in that math and again, this is for first through eighth graders, there's 34 adaptive questions. So again, um if a student's taking both tests, they're gonna be doing 68 questions total. So just keep that in mind when planning and this one just like the reading is approximately 25 to 30 minutes in length and their time limit is three minutes per question. And so again, that timer will be going and count down for them when they get close to that three minute mark and students will log in through their clever and use the Renaissance app like Betty discussed earlier and then the password um is admin and you again, as the teacher will have the right to set that and make it whatever you want. And our ELC training um actually walks you through that, that you're gonna be watching this week. So, um when you're going through that ELC training, that will take you through the specific steps to get you to that um password guide. And so on our next slide, we actually have that link um we're not gonna go into um a ton of detail on this, but I do want you guys to see kind of what it looks like. But again, this is how you as the teacher are going to set that star password for your students and this will be set and all of your students will use it. Um So just keep in mind something that's simple. Um But following the guidelines as well, um so this will be given to you in the ELC. But again, um you will have control over this um and your own, you'll get to monitor this password so you can change it each window and keep it the same throughout. It is up to you, you get to monitor that. Um But this will all be done within that Renaissance app um before you go give the star test, so best practice would be that you have all of this set before you go give that first star assessment to your first student that you're benchmarking. Um So this is something that you will do prior to meeting your students for their benchmark and um navigating through that Renaissance Bar at the top and under your name, there's a drop down a little carrot that will take you and to where you need to go and edit preferences. And so in that drop down, you'll select edit preferences and then from your preferences, you are going to go to your classrooms. And so the class preference and then monitor password star test is what we're looking for there. And again, you guys will have access to these slides and these links. Um If you don't get all of these steps today, it's also in the ELC that is gonna be um delivered to you guys tomorrow in that platform. So just keep in mind you will set that password for whatever you want it to be. And then that is what you're going to use to log in for your students to take their assessment. All right. So some common questions um and answers over our star and so can I read a star math allowed to my students? And your answer is if you have a struggling reader and that pivots from the star reading to take star early literacy, the early literacy test, the student must take the star math if they're in grades one and up. Um in these cases, it's allowed to utilize the read, allow feature in star. And so all students taking the star early literacy can have math read allowed if deemed necessary. Um And so what this is referring to is um Betty discussed the benchmark sheet. It's kind of a cheat sheet for you guys. Um And then it went into the CBM guidelines. And so what that looks like is if and, and we'll go into further detail uh and a further training on this, but based on their score um in the star reading, they may have to go again and take that star early literacy test. Um And if they take that star early literacy test, then they will have that read aloud feature um if it's deemed necessary. So keep that in mind, um we will give further training on that at a later date when it's closer to time. Another question is, can a student use a personal ipad to do the star bench mark? Yes, they can. And the student will need to ensure that they have downloaded and installed the Clever app and then sign in with their school account. And so it may be their personal ipad, but it has to be logged in through all of our epic information. And this is the only way that they'll have access to everything that they need in order to be successful to take their star. And again, Betty mentioned earlier chromebooks, laptops are the easiest way and you providing that for your students. Um But if they happen to have a, a school ipad or their own that they use on a daily basis, especially your, your kindergarteners and possibly some first graders if they've been with us and they have ipads, they do have access to those and use and can use those. And we just prefer for the older grades to use those chromebooks. So keep that in mind. Um What do I do if my student cannot make it past the practice questions we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier. Um but the practice questions do not count in the student score. Therefore, you may have to help the student complete the practice questions in order to advance them to the actual test. If the student is struggling reading or a sped student with accommodations, be sure to have the conversation with your principal about whether giving the star early literacy test to the student would be most appropriate. And so in these cases, according to RS A guidelines, we have to give the student the required assessment first for their grade level. Um even if it is an O A student. So if we have a third grade o A student, we still need to give that third grade OAP student that star reading test first based on their ability. Remember those questions will adapt for that student and um you may help them get through that practice, but we wanna see their actual knowledge because this um this data is also reported to the state for RS A purposes. Um but again, if that student is, is truly struggling and they cannot make it through that um star reading and it finally kind of closes out because they're not answering questions and they are not capable of answering questions, then discuss with your principal of conversation of giving them that early literacy test followed. And that way we can truly get some data as to what they do know. Um but again, they have to take the grade level required assessment first and then we can move down to something lower if needed or appropriate for the student. And so again, we can't forget about that dyslexia House Bill 28 04. We talked about this last week. And so this is referred to as the star CBM. And it, it does not provide a diagnosis for dyslexia. This is only a tool to help provide appropriate instruction for students. And this is required by law and it will be reported with RS A data during the year. And so again, this is one of those things that if um your student school below a specific percentile on their star reading or early literacy, you will then be required to give them this CBM screener and all of it is housed within the same Renaissance App. Um And as you uh let me see if I can go back to that slide where it shows um it does have all of it listed in your Renaissance. I'm sorry, I can't find it right now. But um when you open that up, it is there for you and um then you can see the star reading star math early lit and then there's an option for the star CV M. So keep that in mind um on our next slide, it does tell us um those kindergartners, we're not gonna look at that CBM until the winter window. Um but if they score below 40th percentile on their early literacy test, then they will be required to take the CBM and they will be taking the rapid color naming portion of that CBM. And if you have a first grader, the scores below the 40th percentile, and that's kind of the key percentile to think about. If the student scores below that 40th percentile on that first grade level assessment, then we're gonna drop it down to a lower assessment. And since star early literacy is the low one, we have our first graders will go straight to that Star CBM as well as those kindergartners um and take the appropriate CBM screener. And so for first grade, it's gonna be expressive nonsense words and rapid name coloring. And but then second grade, remember they start at the star reading and so if they score below grade level, which is below the 40th percentile, then we would give them the star early literacy test. If they continue to score below the 40th percentile on that star early literacy, then we go to the Star CBM Screener where they will take expressive nonsense words in rapid name, uh color naming and same thing with third grade. And that star reading, that's where they start at below 40th percentile. They go to early literacy below 40th percentile on that. Then they go to the Star CBM and this is something that is just for the reading portion of our star and it will not be done on math because again, that's completely different subject. So keep that in mind and there is a possibility that you are gonna have to assess a student on all three of those and different star assessments. So keep that in mind. Ok, a few things to consider with your star CBM. Um first through third grade students, um the star CBM must be given within 30 days of completion of the benchmark, but no later than November 1st in order to comply with RS A law. And so again, if you see in those results and that data given to you from the star that they are in that below 40 percentile, we need a automatically schedule a time to give them that Star CBM within 30 days and sooner the better is, is kind of best practice. So um students that come to us after November 1st and they will still be required to take both the star tests and, and if they qualify, they will take that Star CBM to pro to progress, monitor them. And so again, that's just just like a late enrolling. If they come to us after November 1st, that deadline, we want to still follow those same processes, one to see where they are as a learner. And so you can individualize their education. But also, and we just wanna make sure that we are monitoring them and able to teach the best we can to their specific needs. And so those are those guidelines you'll follow for kindergarten, kindergarten students and they must be given that star CBM within 30 days as well of the winter benchmark. Um So keep in mind our kindergarteners, you're just giving that star early lit. And um that's what they're gonna take in this window. We don't have to look at that percentile until after we have taught them a little bit to see where they are at. So in that winter window, that is when we will look at their percentile. If they are below 40 percentile, we will give them that CBM. Um It is best practice to give the star CBM immediately after star bench marking, if the student scored in the 39th percentile or below. And in that event, your student, your your star scores are not immediately available. Star CBM must be given within those 30 days. So you will also be taught how to pull reports. So you can look at this data and and see how to read what percentile they are in, I promise you. Ok. So we are going to move away from star and for a moment and we are going to go into performance matters. And so what is performance matters? Um Performance matters is an eae a epic data warehouse. And so this is a platform that you guys will get to through Clever as well or no, sorry, excuse me, through your power school. Um And this is going to be a, just a good place for you to look at data on your student. And so you will log in to performance matters through Power School. And in power school, you have a little waffle, um or checkerboard, whatever you call it in that top right corner of your screen. And from there that drop down, you will select the performance matters option. Um A dashboard is what you will see once you log in. And so you will have a dashboard of all of your students. And so these icons over here that are blurred out, those are your students and their names and their grades that they are in. And from there, you can select a specific student and you can go into specific courses or um I'm sorry, subjects in order to see data based on the assessment that they've taken and any detailed information that they have um completed with you. And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna look at test results. And so this is to view formative and so the formative will be housed in your Epic Ed platform and for your students that are in grades pre K through T and and then that the formative are basically their standard based assessments. And so the data that you wanna look at is after they've completed those formative, then you'll go to performance matters to look at those um all in one place. So to view formative or common. Um, you're gonna go to uh state test scores and benchmarks. Um This will give you additional scores for the student again based on the assessments they have taken with you um inside Epic Ed and outside. Um So within performance matters, you have access to a baseball card report and this report is going to be helpful for you and it is a navigation tool um on the menu in the left, you'll choose reports and then baseball card report. And so this is going to be something that um if you are grouping students or even just looking at a student individually for their needs, and this will give you that data. So this next picture that we're gonna show and gives you a little glimpse of what that baseball card looks like, but you have your students and their student ID and grade level, um and then you will have specific standards listed out on this baseball card and you can customize this baseball card by grade level. And so you're looking at one grade level across the board or all of your students on the roster at once. You can choose that on your own. And most of this data will be coming from principals and principals will most likely share these baseball card reports with you. And as they're tracking data throughout the. And so again, these are results from those students formative as you can see, they will highlight by color based on how that student does on those assessments. Um Obviously, if there's no color, they haven't completed that one yet. So this is just a good way and to help keep you accountable with tracking those formative the students are doing and as they go throughout the school year, and again, this will be discussed more on a principle by principle basis. And every principal kind of gives a different directive on these and how to go about these. So if you have questions, reach out to your TV S or your principal on those topics, OK. So the formative that are found within performance matters are the high school formative that are in theology home room and they will go into performance matters. So if you are wanting to assess those high schoolers and as they are getting prepared to, to learn a little bit more about them, that data will be shown and as well as third through eighth grades will take graders will take their first formative through Epic Ed. And if that standard is not mastered, then the teacher could reteach and then give formative b in the school home room. And so you have several options for students to complete these formative. And again, these formative are covering specific standards throughout the year. Um So you'll teach, they'll practice and then as you assess, you're gonna assess them using these formative. Um the first formative again, like I mentioned will be given through epi um but if we didn't show mastery on that, we need to go back and reteach, they can have a second option. Um We can't reset them with an EIC. So they have housed a formative B option inside your home room and you can give it a second, second time um with different questions um on the same standard that they needed retaught and then assessed again. So that is there for you. And um, we are going to be going into some of this school training and um in Power School on Thursday. So you will be getting training over those platforms as well. And um you will be able to grade open-ended response questions and evidence captures for high school formative and performance matters. And a lot of our high schoolers will be doing writing prompts um or like mentioned evidence captures where they have to attach and upload things that they have completed and this is where you are gonna go and you can grade those inside performance matters and just a few resources that we wanted to share with you guys. Um based off of today's um our Epic One assessments page, all things benchmarks, assessments will be on that page and these links will get you directly to that. Um The Epic One Star testing an informational page benchmark, frequently asked questions and the star testing checklist. And so again, we want to provide you guys with resources that will make it easier for you to remember all of this information that we are throwing at you. And so this is a great place to start when you're seeking some resources. And that is what we have for today. Um Again, our topics that we covered in today's training are clever sign on benchmarking star and performance matters. And in the chat box, you will find that Q and A document and please make sure that you're looking at the week four tab whenever you are putting questions on that Q and A sheet. Um Because that are, those are the questions referring back to today's training. So, um thank you guys for being here with us today and don't forget your small group Q and A s with your individual T DS teams that are on um tomorrow or Friday. And um if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach, hey, and I'm also gonna add before you guys go because there's quite a few questions in the chat already or in the uh sheet. So if you guys got on there while we were presenting and tried to log in to your Renaissance, you probably found that you don't have the Renaissance app. That's ok. Don't panic, do not submit a ticket and they're still loading. So there is, and I linked it in the Q and A sheet. There is an actual system support page that you guys can see the loading status of different curriculums of different programs. Um And star is one of those that they are still loading students. So have no fear it will be loaded before you guys start taking benchmarks. But also don't panic if you don't see it yet, just keep checking back here and there and when it's green, it's all good to go and you guys can get in the name of your Renaissance app. Thank you Ben. All right guys. That's all we have for you today. So thank you again for joining us and we will see you next time.\"), (2104, 747, 5014, \"All right, happy Tuesday guys. We're happy to see you guys for our fundamental training. Um We kinda have a big week this week. We have, um, today we're gonna go over mostly assessments and um those type of things. And then Thursday we're gonna have a good training with our um tech TV SS on our school and some of those things. So that's gonna be a really um informational, good day to come to too. Um, a few reminders for today, we have our Q and A sheet, we'll put um the link to at the end. So if you have questions, you can type them in there and we will answer them like we have been. Um and then um reminder for virtual etiquette, make sure you have your camera on. You're um sitting up um make sure you're focused and um paying attention to our training today. And um what else? And then just a reminder to keep checking Epic one. It's such a good resource and I know in my small groups we've gone through how to just search for random things and look for things. If you just search in that search bar at the top. There's so many good things you can find and all the resources and information that you could need. Um So those are just a few reminders for this morning. And um yeah, we'll go ahead and get started. So this is week four. I can't believe next week is our last week of summer training and then the week after that is um school starting. So it's just crazy how fast it's gone and it's been a great summer with you guys. So this is week four assessment. So we're gonna go over clever sign on benchmarking star and then performance matters with you guys for today and a reminder, we'll send all these slides and all the recording and everything to you um following this training from our teacher development email. So you guys will have that handy and you guys can look for the resources. All right, we'll go ahead and get started with Clever sign on. So Clever Sso stands for a single sign on. All right. So what is clever? So you've probably heard us talk about Clever. Um So what is it? It is a single sign on that enables Epic teachers, students and staff. So everybody basically at Epic to securely authenticate and log into connected applications via the Clever portal. Um So users log in to Clever just with one set of credentials, then they click on various app icons to automatically log into platforms via single sign on So you and your students can sign on the clever one, sign on and then you'll be able to go to all these different programs. So, if you have your students in their core curriculum there, they can click on their co curriculum and be able to find it. If you have supplemental curriculums, you can find those in there. Normally too, you can add other things that you need in there that your, um, students might be working on or they might need. So it's just really nice because it's a one stop shop for all the things that they might need to log into. And it's just easy because I just have to remember, log in for one thing rather than a million because I know I forget my passwords all the time for all the different things that we have passwords for these days. All right. So a few clever highlights. So it offers teachers and students the simple secure login experience. So it's secure. Um, you log in with your Google stuff. So it makes it real easy. Um It's the one stop shop that houses digital learning curriculum supplements and resources. There's so many things in there and then it saves time by allowing the users the ability to log in to one platform to seamlessly visit the various applications necessary. So it's just one spot that they can add into. All right, and then the students can find everything in one place. So this is what it looks like from the from their view. And its districts specify the right resources for each class based on the data from the cyst. So that's our student information system. So um Epic will have certain ones that will come on and I mean certain applications that will load automatically into clever. So those will be there. Um You can add even more classroom resources. So there's ones that will automatically be loaded. But if you wanna add some different ones, you can do that. Um There's a search bar and you can search for different programs and things that you might wanna add and then students are able to quickly immerse themselves in digital learning. So like in the past, with Epic, we would give our students a whole login sheet of stuff like there's this curriculum and how to log in, here's this curriculum and how to log in. Now, they can just log in a clever and like 99% of their curriculum will be in this one spot rather than them having to remember a million sign in. So they can easily get into their school work for the day without having a second guess. How do I get in there? Where is my curriculum? How do I log in? But all right. So how do you access Clever. So this is the link on the right side of this screen. So teachers and students access Clever with that link. Um It'll look like this picture on the left. So you just log in with your Google. Um And it's real easy, kind of like we do with most of our things at Epic. It's just a Google sign in it makes it real simple. Um And so that's the link right there. And I'm gonna show you on the next few slides how to um some other ways to find that link. So you don't have to have that saved right there. So where is the link? No worries. So if you go to your Epic One page again, like I said at the beginning, Epic One has a million different resources and things that are real handy for us. So if you go to the launcher on the top right page or top right of your page on Epic One, it's that little rocket ship. If you click that, then you can go down and you will find the clever login. So you see right there under the bamboo is the clever login. Um And you can notice also that the fresh service can be accessed there as well. So that's our ticketing where you can ask questions um whenever you're having issues with anything, um you can see fresh services there also. So that's one spot you can find the uh link for Clever. Another way is via the Bookmark Bar. So hopefully, everybody by this point has that staff links um on the Bookmark Bar. I know a bunch of us had that issue at the beginning, but it should be fixed hopefully. Now, um, so you can click that and go down to that curriculum logins and then Clever will be right there as well. That's the way I normally access it just because it's the easiest and it's always right there for me. So I go down to curriculum logins and then Clever and that's the same way your students will find it as well. They'll go to curriculum and then they'll go to Clever. And then if you want, you can also create a bookmark and put it on your own bookmark. If you would like to do that, if you don't wanna have to click those three ways. All right. So log in and portal. So upon logging in, each user will see their own portal. So when homeroom is selected, the following things will be displayed. So teacher pages, favorites, district core curricula, supplemental apps, Google apps and staff resources. Um So you can use your landing page to best suit your individual needs. You can kind of edit it and you can favorite some. And so you can see on that little picture right there, there's a favorites one. So you can start the ones that you use most often and they'll go right to that spot. Um And you can have quick access to the app. So you'll have all the apps listed here that any of your students are using um, your students won't have as many as you because they'll just have the ones they're in. But you have all of them there, which is really nice. So if you have a bunch of students in one, you can favorite it. Put it at that spot, make it real easy to find and, um, access. All right. Ok. So, feature information. These are all really handy links. We're not gonna click through them, but they are really handy. And um if you're having issues with any of these things, I just want to find out more about any of these. Um So the clever portal, if you have questions about teacher pages, how to add applications, um sending messages or announcements and then analytics. So if you need to learn more about um figuring out the analytics of, did my student log in? How long did they log in for all those information? So these are just resources that are real handy and you can um pull up if you need to find out more information about those. All right, login issues. So again, if you're having login issues, we're gonna go to that fresh service ticket to the SSS department. So you can go to that launcher and go to fresh service. Um And that's one of one way you can find that you can also do it again. And the staff links on the left, there's lots of options. You can kind of figure out a pattern that most of our important, um, links and things are in those two spots. So they're kind of easy to find. Um So you'll click fresh service and then once you're there, you're gonna do a ticket to system support and they'll help you be able to log in. Um, hopefully you don't have login issues. But if you do, that's the way to the way to handle it. And then clever support. I have found this clever support to be actually one of the more helpful um like support pages on any website that I've seen. So if you click that question mark at the top and you can go to help center, it will pop up like a little, it's almost like a chat box, but it's not really chatting with a real person. But if you type your issue, it normally will pull up your issue immediately like a website or how to steps or whatever. And it's super helpful on um whatever issue you might be having. Um So that's one way if you're having a, have a question or wanna figure something out quick, you can use that help center. Um And let's see. And then there's the clever support website that has all sorts of stuff that you need. And then quick guides on Clever Academy is there as well. And then teachers can find these links also by clicking on the icon on the blue navigation bar, um Help center and Clever Academy So that's that question mark. I was just talking about this will be there. All right, I'm gonna pass it over to Miss Betty B for some benchmarking. OK. We get to talk about benchmarking. I know that this is probably something that you guys have talked about in your principal groups or you've heard that teachers talking about? Um I know some of my teachers have asked, can we go ahead and start scheduling benchmark testing? So I think that kind of depends more on your principal and your team and what you're wanting if you're going to those I LP S, if they're wanting you to go ahead and schedule those benchmarks, um even though you don't really know anything because we're just now hitting the training on it, um You can still schedule them because we have a benchmark window that we'll talk about in these slides. Ok. So first things first, who is required to take this, our pre K through first graders over here? Um Pre K does not have to take it during this first window. So this first fall window, pre K does not have to take it at all. Um When their window opens in the winter, they will take start early literacy. That being said, you're more than welcome to give them the start early literacy. If you're wanting to give them something to have like a starting base of where they're at, you're more than welcome. It's just not mandatory and then kindergarten are going are going to take the early star literacy and then first grades taking star, early literacy and math. Then our second through eighth graders are taking star math, not early literacy, but star math and reading. And then our high school students are not required to take benchmarks. We are wanting to focus on um their ac T prep. So just because they're not required to take benchmarks doesn't mean that you can't use a tool to assess where they're at. And there are tools and options available in your school home room that you can see where your high school students are and then how to access this. This is again in your clever. So what Susie touched on before that handy dandy, everything you need to sign into all these fun programs are in your clever account. So you'll go to your Clever and log in and then there's an app and it's gonna be under the big R Renaissance app. And then you can see after you click that on step three that there's the star early literacy, the star, reading the star Math, and then proctoring those benchmarks. We want to make sure that we are with our students. When they are taking this benchmark. We don't want to just say, hey, here's your benchmark. They wanna take it and we wanna be there. We wanna Proctor, we wanna make sure that they are doing their best their first time. This is a, a way for us to see where our students are. Currently. A lot of these students you guys are getting or all of them really? You guys are new teachers that you don't know anything about these kids. You don't know where they're at, where, where they're may be struggling. And so when you start talking about supplements and things like that, you don't really know what to get that student yet until we take this benchmark. So it's highly encouraged to make sure that they do their best. That way, we have a really good picture of where they're at and discuss that with the families. Let them know what this benchmark is for and why it's important that they do their best, um and make sure that the student is in their own account, not. And sometimes if you're using your own computer, you might have a student log in from it or something like that. So just double check and make sure that it's the student that's in there taking the correct test, we cannot delete assessment. So after an assessment is done, that is in there forever, we can't go back and delete that. Um, if you're with the ears and you're doing it in a group, it is a verbal test. So we wanna make sure that they have headsets. Um If you're doing a one on one that's fine, make sure it's in a quiet room where they can hear that verbal um information being presented in that test and then assessments are password protected. You will generate this yourself as a teacher and we have a document of how to do that. And we're gonna talk about that here in a minute too. But, um, the star passwords are created by you and then all star benchmarks must be Proctor in person, as I said, um, students are gonna log in and you guys will instruct them. It's the same thing. They're gonna go through the clever, it's really easy. Um But just make sure that you schedule a time with them that you can meet in person, you can do a group or you can do one on one. And then the setting is really the key to having a successful testing environment. Um You wanna consider these options, you want to consider the setting of where you are going to be at. Is it going to be at a coffee shop library or the student's home? Is the library your local library loud? I know mine is. So that wasn't always the best option for me, especially if maybe the family brought siblings, it tended to get really, really loud. Um So just kind of be mindful of that. You want the student to be able to work in an environment where they can focus and there's no distractions and then determine is it group or individual? If you're testing in a group of students, how are you going to have the students log in. Are you going to stagger? Are you going to have them all do it at the same time as you walk them through it and kind of some things to think about and talk to your T DS about those kinds of helpful hints. And then do you need to do individual testing? I know again, like I said, you don't know your students yet that you might decide to do group this time and then you might have a couple that you're like, oh, I'm gonna do one on one next time because that did not go over very well. So some do well in groups and some maybe we need to do one on one and then definitely don't wait until the last minute to schedule benchmarks. I know that we have a window just because we have that window doesn't mean waiting till the end of the window to schedule. You wanna do it as early in the window that you can. Um really that window is for the towards the end is to be able to do your reschedules. If you have kiddos who couldn't make the first scheduled meeting, then we have time to reschedule or um maybe we get students who are enrolled later on, then we wanna benchmark them in that window, but we can have them at the end. Don't save all your kiddos for the end and there will be rescheduled. I will say that so prepare for that. Ok. So we're gonna dive in a little bit and look at this benchmark schedule. This will be linked here in the presentation as well. Um But this is the yearly, the overall year benchmark schedule for you guys. So you can see that first column, August 14th through September 1st is our first benchmark window. And over there to the left pre K is not required and then you'll see kindergarten, kindergarten through third startler literacy and then it says, please see CBM, the guidance tab for additional information. So you can see down at the bottom, there's AC BM requirement tab. So make sure you look at that tab and, and review that, that way, you know what that is talking about. There's also an OAP tab so that if you have OAP students, what their requirements are and then kind of get ahead and look, look at what the next window is. Our next window is November 27th through December 15th. So as we get closer to that window and you guys are doing meetups, it might be good to start scheduling that ahead of time. Um Things change, their schedules will change and that's fine. But if you can have something on your calendar and on your book and then make those adjustments as needed, it just helps you guys get ahead of the game. So definitely refer back to this beco be aware of the upcoming benchmark windows, ok? So high school benchmarks, like we said, they are not required this year. Um High school benchmark tests will still be available for teachers and families who are wanting to take them and those can be accessed in your school homeroom and the high school students will all have their own home room that they can access those. Um instead of benchmarks, we're having students complete their AC T prep courses, they will be working out of either Alex, no red ink or Magus depending on what grade level that they're in. Exemptions for any AC T prep course will only be given to those students who have national AC T test of 22 or above in English reading and Math and they must also have an MD I approval and then there's also a diagnostic test available in the red ink. The initial placement test will be of value in Alex and teachers should assign practice AC T test in the goose to prepare students for the AC T test. April some other assessments to be mindful of for our high school kiddos. We do us citizen and ology homeroom. The US citizenship test will be open in October and students must have the study guide for at least 30 days before taking that test and then practice AC T benchmarks are again and homework. So let's talk through some comment, benchmark, frequently asked questions. Can I give a benchmark at an I LP meeting? No, that's the short answer. Um, long answer is it takes at least 48 hours for that student's information to roll over into the system. Therefore, they're not gonna be set up, um, to log in and take their benchmark. We encourage teachers to schedule a separate meeting. You can schedule those benchmark meetings while you're at the I LP meeting. So while you're there, you have the family there, you can say, hey, our benchmark window is at this time. What would be a good day for you to come and meet up for benchmarks and you might give them just a couple day options or maybe that first week option maybe don't tell them the whole window so that they don't schedule themselves for the last week as well. Um Can students take their test on a mobile device? No, these assessments must be taken on a laptop or a chromebook phones and ipads will not work for it and students can take assessments on a PC or Apple computers, but again, no tablets or mobile devices and then my student's computer died slash reset. Had the connection interrupted during the test. What do I do? Star actually saves the students work in progress. So the students should be able to log right back in and start where they left off. The question itself may be different but the progress is saved. Then what do I do? If a student enrolls during a benchmark window, they will have to participate in that benchmark window, whatever window it is that they're enrolled in. So if you do have a student who enrolls and it is like you're at the very end of that benchmark window, it's really important that maybe you set up that I LP meeting, but also the benchmark meeting as you're doing that too. And how do I, what do I do? Sorry, what do I do if a student enrolls between benchmark windows? So between benchmark windows, new students should be benchmarked within 10 days of the I LP completion. So maybe we've already ended this first benchmark and you get a new student, we don't want to just not give them one because it's not required. We still, the whole purpose of the benchmarks is to see where our student is. So we have no way of knowing where our student is unless we give them that benchmark. So even though it's out of the benchmark within the 1st 10 days, we want to give them a benchmark. So we can figure out what the learning plan for that student would be. Are there any exceptions for taking benchmark tests? No, all students in pre K through eight must be benchmark. Um This is also stated on the I LP whenever you meet with the family. So maybe this is something that you really hit on in your expectations is, hey, we, we require these benchmarks, they're gonna happen these time frames. You guys have that schedule um and also let them know the state testing for your state test kiddos. But these help us um we have practice AC T bench marks available as well and it just helps uh parents prepare for those national and state tests. So let's do a quick review because that's a lot. Um So high school students again are not required to benchmark. We are offering them a CD benchmarks if they want to for practice. And then pre K is not required for the first window, one K through eight. But you can still give your pre K just, you don't have to um testing takes place in the Star app found under the Renaissance app in Clever and Windows are only three weeks long. So plan accordingly, don't wait until the last week. An optional fourth window for showing growth for students is available and then optional progress monitoring the entire year. So you don't have to just give this one test and be done. You can go back and give them this test over and over again if you wanna monitor their growth throughout the school year, but you just have to give it at least in the benchmark window. All right hand this over to Kaitlyn. Thank you, Betty. And so uh Betty just covered our benchmark and what we give. So now we're gonna dig a little bit deeper into Star and actually how to give that assessment and how it's built and created because I know some of you, if you don't have an early childhood background, you've probably never seen the star or given the star before. And so that was me coming into epic with a high school background. And so we want to make sure that you guys understand what the star assessment is actually doing with your students, but also how to prepare yourself for giving that in a proper manner as well. So what is Star and the Star assessment are short tests that provide teachers with learning data and they are adaptive to students and they adjust um to each answer your student provides and this helps teachers get data that is best to help students in the shortest amount of time and that is very reliable in their results. So um just so you guys know in your planning and each step, our test is roughly about 20 to 30 minutes depending on your student and their ability and they are um short and condensed and like I mentioned, they are adaptive. So as your student continues to answers, answer questions correctly, they are going to adapt up in level. Um And as they or if they reverse of that, they are answering them incorrectly, it will adapt to lower standards. So keep that in mind and that's why we always say it's best practice to proctor these in person and really monitor these students. So you can understand where their deficits are and where their achievements are as well. So no matter what test you take in star, it's adaptive like I mentioned previously and it will alter the progression of questions based on how the student answers. So it is extremely important that because this test is adaptive that we do not help students at all. And this needs to be communicated to parents as well. We all know that we want our, our parents want their Children to succeed. So it's super easy for a mom to sit next to them and say, oh, remember we've talked about this or oh, look at all of your answers. We appreciate parents and their willingness to help their students succeed. But we want to see truly what the student knows and how we are going to plan accordingly to teach them individually for the rest of that school year. And so because that star is adaptive again, we want to communicate to all parties that are in the room taking that test at that time that they have to do it on their own in their own um capabilities. And we don't want to provide false information and to the algorithm that star uses. And we don't want that to change the difficulty of the test. Remember, we talked about how it is adaptive and progressive. So if a student is getting help and they're getting answers correct, it's just gonna continue to get harder and harder and more frustrating for that student when they are actually doing work on their own. So keep that in mind. Um, again, be best practice and something that I always used as a teacher with my students is mom and dad. I'm just gonna keep them for 30 minutes. You can take brother or sister over to the playground next door or whatever that looks like. And in the facility that you're giving this test in that way you can properly monitor your students without any distractions at all. But again, here, we're looking at our students knowledge sting. Um And so we just want to evaluate them and see exactly where they are in order to continue on with their education journey after this assessment is given. So you will be giving based on your roster several different types of tests. So we want you to make sure we want to make sure, excuse me that you understand, kind of what they look like that way you're prepared for when you give these tests to your students the first time. So your star early lit is for pre K starting in the winter window all the way through first grade. So your kindergarten through first grade students will be taking it in this first window and there's approximately 27 questions and based on your students ability, it could be 15 to 20 minutes. And so keep that in mind every student is different. So it's always important to schedule a good 30 minute windows for these kiddos. To get them in, get them logged in, get them prepared and set up for the test and then appropriate amount of time to complete the test. And so there is a time limit of 90 seconds per question on that star early lit. And so what that looks like is there is 90 seconds per question. And if your student is getting close to that 92nd mark, there will be a timer and that counts down for that student. And if they do not answer the question in that appropriate amount of time, then it will just move on. Um And it will, it will, what's the word I'm looking for? Um It will assume that that student got it incorrect because there was no given answer and then it will adapt based on that. So sometimes this can be a trigger for students. It could be nerve wracking, but just remind your students to do their absolute best. And um you know, if they don't know something, we don't just want them clicking to guess. We want them to try and then go from there. Um With our early lit this does read questions to the students and it is audible like Betty said, we wanna make sure that they have headphones um and that they are prepared for that in the type of setting you're giving it. And so there is an option to repeat those questions. Um And it will do that automatically after. So many seconds have gone. So just be prepared. This is only on that early lit test and that it will provide that student with the audio and questions. So then we move on to the star reading test for our second through eighth grade students. And this test is a little bit longer. Our kids have a little bit more of an attention span. So there's roughly 34 adaptive questions and this one will last 25 to 30 minutes. And again, this varies on students. Um If they are a high performing student and they are answering questions a lot faster, then they're gonna get through this assessment faster or vice versa. It may take them that entire 30 minute time to complete this assessment. And so the time limit varies from 45 seconds to two minutes depending on the grade level and the question in each section in that star reading test. And so practice questions will start at the very beginning and this will be something that you as the teacher are able to guide them through with those practice questions to ensure that they know how to complete the test appropriately. Um These practice questions do not count towards their overall data that we are taking from the test. Um But it is important that the student knows exactly how to navigate how to answer the questions appropriately. And keep in mind some of these students, if it's their first time with Epic, they may be using a chromebook for the first time and they may need a mouse to work with because they've never used the little pad um on a chromebook and every student is a little bit different. So keep these things in mind before you're going into these assessments as well because that might be something that you work with the student on before we do these practice questions. And that way when they get to the practice question, they can start answering them with more confidence. And we're not stressed out about not knowing how to use that pad on the chromebook or the mouse depending on which you have provided for them or they have. So keep that in mind. And if a student cannot independently complete the practice questions, we still want to move them through them to give that star early literacy test. We do have students that may not be able to answer some of those practice questions. And we want you as the facilitator to help them get through the practice questions um if they are needing help, but as soon as that actual assessment starts, they need to independently complete the rest of the start early literacy test. So keep in mind, this is mainly for your um lower functioning kiddos, your of kids, things like that and those kids that are unable to fully function and understand how to get through those practice questions. That's when you as the teacher can help um outside of that, again, just use your best judgment when getting them through the practice questions. And if they have been with us at Epic before, they've taken this assessment before multiple times. So it's familiar to them. And ideally if they aren't from Epic in their um in early childhood, they have taken it as well at another school. So um just keep that in mind. But again, if they need assistance, you can only help them during those practice questions. So keep that in mind. And then also for our first through eighth graders, they take the star math. Um So again, keep in mind your first through eighth graders, they're gonna be taking both reading and math or early lit and math. So keep in mind um when you're scheduling these, it's not just one or the other, it's gonna be both and how you schedule that with your families is up to you and some students, their attention span is that 30 minutes and they're done for the day. And so kind of keep that in mind and take that judgment into consider consideration whenever you are at that IOP meeting, meeting the family for the first time. And, and you can always change your mind, you can take one assessment and if that student is ready and they still have some motivation to continue on to the next go for it. If they don't, then maybe we wanna reschedule and do it again. The next day or go take a, a brain break, let them play outside for a little bit and then come back and complete the other assessment. So just any of those scenarios can happen and they will happen. So just keep thinking about those as you are getting to know these families and what can your student handle in an appropriate setting? Um But in that math and again, this is for first through eighth graders, there's 34 adaptive questions. So again, um if a student's taking both tests, they're gonna be doing 68 questions total. So just keep that in mind when planning and this one just like the reading is approximately 25 to 30 minutes in length and their time limit is three minutes per question. And so again, that timer will be going and count down for them when they get close to that three minute mark and students will log in through their clever and use the Renaissance app like Betty discussed earlier and then the password um is admin and you again, as the teacher will have the right to set that and make it whatever you want. And our ELC training um actually walks you through that, that you're gonna be watching this week. So, um when you're going through that ELC training, that will take you through the specific steps to get you to that um password guide. And so on our next slide, we actually have that link um we're not gonna go into um a ton of detail on this, but I do want you guys to see kind of what it looks like. But again, this is how you as the teacher are going to set that star password for your students and this will be set and all of your students will use it. Um So just keep in mind something that's simple. Um But following the guidelines as well, um so this will be given to you in the ELC. But again, um you will have control over this um and your own, you'll get to monitor this password so you can change it each window and keep it the same throughout. It is up to you, you get to monitor that. Um But this will all be done within that Renaissance app um before you go give the star test, so best practice would be that you have all of this set before you go give that first star assessment to your first student that you're benchmarking. Um So this is something that you will do prior to meeting your students for their benchmark and um navigating through that Renaissance Bar at the top and under your name, there's a drop down a little carrot that will take you and to where you need to go and edit preferences. And so in that drop down, you'll select edit preferences and then from your preferences, you are going to go to your classrooms. And so the class preference and then monitor password star test is what we're looking for there. And again, you guys will have access to these slides and these links. Um If you don't get all of these steps today, it's also in the ELC that is gonna be um delivered to you guys tomorrow in that platform. So just keep in mind you will set that password for whatever you want it to be. And then that is what you're going to use to log in for your students to take their assessment. All right. So some common questions um and answers over our star and so can I read a star math allowed to my students? And your answer is if you have a struggling reader and that pivots from the star reading to take star early literacy, the early literacy test, the student must take the star math if they're in grades one and up. Um in these cases, it's allowed to utilize the read, allow feature in star. And so all students taking the star early literacy can have math read allowed if deemed necessary. Um And so what this is referring to is um Betty discussed the benchmark sheet. It's kind of a cheat sheet for you guys. Um And then it went into the CBM guidelines. And so what that looks like is if and, and we'll go into further detail uh and a further training on this, but based on their score um in the star reading, they may have to go again and take that star early literacy test. Um And if they take that star early literacy test, then they will have that read aloud feature um if it's deemed necessary. So keep that in mind, um we will give further training on that at a later date when it's closer to time. Another question is, can a student use a personal ipad to do the star bench mark? Yes, they can. And the student will need to ensure that they have downloaded and installed the Clever app and then sign in with their school account. And so it may be their personal ipad, but it has to be logged in through all of our epic information. And this is the only way that they'll have access to everything that they need in order to be successful to take their star. And again, Betty mentioned earlier chromebooks, laptops are the easiest way and you providing that for your students. Um But if they happen to have a, a school ipad or their own that they use on a daily basis, especially your, your kindergarteners and possibly some first graders if they've been with us and they have ipads, they do have access to those and use and can use those. And we just prefer for the older grades to use those chromebooks. So keep that in mind. Um What do I do if my student cannot make it past the practice questions we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier. Um but the practice questions do not count in the student score. Therefore, you may have to help the student complete the practice questions in order to advance them to the actual test. If the student is struggling reading or a sped student with accommodations, be sure to have the conversation with your principal about whether giving the star early literacy test to the student would be most appropriate. And so in these cases, according to RS A guidelines, we have to give the student the required assessment first for their grade level. Um even if it is an O A student. So if we have a third grade o A student, we still need to give that third grade OAP student that star reading test first based on their ability. Remember those questions will adapt for that student and um you may help them get through that practice, but we wanna see their actual knowledge because this um this data is also reported to the state for RS A purposes. Um but again, if that student is, is truly struggling and they cannot make it through that um star reading and it finally kind of closes out because they're not answering questions and they are not capable of answering questions, then discuss with your principal of conversation of giving them that early literacy test followed. And that way we can truly get some data as to what they do know. Um but again, they have to take the grade level required assessment first and then we can move down to something lower if needed or appropriate for the student. And so again, we can't forget about that dyslexia House Bill 28 04. We talked about this last week. And so this is referred to as the star CBM. And it, it does not provide a diagnosis for dyslexia. This is only a tool to help provide appropriate instruction for students. And this is required by law and it will be reported with RS A data during the year. And so again, this is one of those things that if um your student school below a specific percentile on their star reading or early literacy, you will then be required to give them this CBM screener and all of it is housed within the same Renaissance App. Um And as you uh let me see if I can go back to that slide where it shows um it does have all of it listed in your Renaissance. I'm sorry, I can't find it right now. But um when you open that up, it is there for you and um then you can see the star reading star math early lit and then there's an option for the star CV M. So keep that in mind um on our next slide, it does tell us um those kindergartners, we're not gonna look at that CBM until the winter window. Um but if they score below 40th percentile on their early literacy test, then they will be required to take the CBM and they will be taking the rapid color naming portion of that CBM. And if you have a first grader, the scores below the 40th percentile, and that's kind of the key percentile to think about. If the student scores below that 40th percentile on that first grade level assessment, then we're gonna drop it down to a lower assessment. And since star early literacy is the low one, we have our first graders will go straight to that Star CBM as well as those kindergartners um and take the appropriate CBM screener. And so for first grade, it's gonna be expressive nonsense words and rapid name coloring. And but then second grade, remember they start at the star reading and so if they score below grade level, which is below the 40th percentile, then we would give them the star early literacy test. If they continue to score below the 40th percentile on that star early literacy, then we go to the Star CBM Screener where they will take expressive nonsense words in rapid name, uh color naming and same thing with third grade. And that star reading, that's where they start at below 40th percentile. They go to early literacy below 40th percentile on that. Then they go to the Star CBM and this is something that is just for the reading portion of our star and it will not be done on math because again, that's completely different subject. So keep that in mind and there is a possibility that you are gonna have to assess a student on all three of those and different star assessments. So keep that in mind. Ok, a few things to consider with your star CBM. Um first through third grade students, um the star CBM must be given within 30 days of completion of the benchmark, but no later than November 1st in order to comply with RS A law. And so again, if you see in those results and that data given to you from the star that they are in that below 40 percentile, we need a automatically schedule a time to give them that Star CBM within 30 days and sooner the better is, is kind of best practice. So um students that come to us after November 1st and they will still be required to take both the star tests and, and if they qualify, they will take that Star CBM to pro to progress, monitor them. And so again, that's just just like a late enrolling. If they come to us after November 1st, that deadline, we want to still follow those same processes, one to see where they are as a learner. And so you can individualize their education. But also, and we just wanna make sure that we are monitoring them and able to teach the best we can to their specific needs. And so those are those guidelines you'll follow for kindergarten, kindergarten students and they must be given that star CBM within 30 days as well of the winter benchmark. Um So keep in mind our kindergarteners, you're just giving that star early lit. And um that's what they're gonna take in this window. We don't have to look at that percentile until after we have taught them a little bit to see where they are at. So in that winter window, that is when we will look at their percentile. If they are below 40 percentile, we will give them that CBM. Um It is best practice to give the star CBM immediately after star bench marking, if the student scored in the 39th percentile or below. And in that event, your student, your your star scores are not immediately available. Star CBM must be given within those 30 days. So you will also be taught how to pull reports. So you can look at this data and and see how to read what percentile they are in, I promise you. Ok. So we are going to move away from star and for a moment and we are going to go into performance matters. And so what is performance matters? Um Performance matters is an eae a epic data warehouse. And so this is a platform that you guys will get to through Clever as well or no, sorry, excuse me, through your power school. Um And this is going to be a, just a good place for you to look at data on your student. And so you will log in to performance matters through Power School. And in power school, you have a little waffle, um or checkerboard, whatever you call it in that top right corner of your screen. And from there that drop down, you will select the performance matters option. Um A dashboard is what you will see once you log in. And so you will have a dashboard of all of your students. And so these icons over here that are blurred out, those are your students and their names and their grades that they are in. And from there, you can select a specific student and you can go into specific courses or um I'm sorry, subjects in order to see data based on the assessment that they've taken and any detailed information that they have um completed with you. And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna look at test results. And so this is to view formative and so the formative will be housed in your Epic Ed platform and for your students that are in grades pre K through T and and then that the formative are basically their standard based assessments. And so the data that you wanna look at is after they've completed those formative, then you'll go to performance matters to look at those um all in one place. So to view formative or common. Um, you're gonna go to uh state test scores and benchmarks. Um This will give you additional scores for the student again based on the assessments they have taken with you um inside Epic Ed and outside. Um So within performance matters, you have access to a baseball card report and this report is going to be helpful for you and it is a navigation tool um on the menu in the left, you'll choose reports and then baseball card report. And so this is going to be something that um if you are grouping students or even just looking at a student individually for their needs, and this will give you that data. So this next picture that we're gonna show and gives you a little glimpse of what that baseball card looks like, but you have your students and their student ID and grade level, um and then you will have specific standards listed out on this baseball card and you can customize this baseball card by grade level. And so you're looking at one grade level across the board or all of your students on the roster at once. You can choose that on your own. And most of this data will be coming from principals and principals will most likely share these baseball card reports with you. And as they're tracking data throughout the. And so again, these are results from those students formative as you can see, they will highlight by color based on how that student does on those assessments. Um Obviously, if there's no color, they haven't completed that one yet. So this is just a good way and to help keep you accountable with tracking those formative the students are doing and as they go throughout the school year, and again, this will be discussed more on a principle by principle basis. And every principal kind of gives a different directive on these and how to go about these. So if you have questions, reach out to your TV S or your principal on those topics, OK. So the formative that are found within performance matters are the high school formative that are in theology home room and they will go into performance matters. So if you are wanting to assess those high schoolers and as they are getting prepared to, to learn a little bit more about them, that data will be shown and as well as third through eighth grades will take graders will take their first formative through Epic Ed. And if that standard is not mastered, then the teacher could reteach and then give formative b in the school home room. And so you have several options for students to complete these formative. And again, these formative are covering specific standards throughout the year. Um So you'll teach, they'll practice and then as you assess, you're gonna assess them using these formative. Um the first formative again, like I mentioned will be given through epi um but if we didn't show mastery on that, we need to go back and reteach, they can have a second option. Um We can't reset them with an EIC. So they have housed a formative B option inside your home room and you can give it a second, second time um with different questions um on the same standard that they needed retaught and then assessed again. So that is there for you. And um, we are going to be going into some of this school training and um in Power School on Thursday. So you will be getting training over those platforms as well. And um you will be able to grade open-ended response questions and evidence captures for high school formative and performance matters. And a lot of our high schoolers will be doing writing prompts um or like mentioned evidence captures where they have to attach and upload things that they have completed and this is where you are gonna go and you can grade those inside performance matters and just a few resources that we wanted to share with you guys. Um based off of today's um our Epic One assessments page, all things benchmarks, assessments will be on that page and these links will get you directly to that. Um The Epic One Star testing an informational page benchmark, frequently asked questions and the star testing checklist. And so again, we want to provide you guys with resources that will make it easier for you to remember all of this information that we are throwing at you. And so this is a great place to start when you're seeking some resources. And that is what we have for today. Um Again, our topics that we covered in today's training are clever sign on benchmarking star and performance matters. And in the chat box, you will find that Q and A document and please make sure that you're looking at the week four tab whenever you are putting questions on that Q and A sheet. Um Because that are, those are the questions referring back to today's training. So, um thank you guys for being here with us today and don't forget your small group Q and A s with your individual T DS teams that are on um tomorrow or Friday. And um if you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach, hey, and I'm also gonna add before you guys go because there's quite a few questions in the chat already or in the uh sheet. So if you guys got on there while we were presenting and tried to log in to your Renaissance, you probably found that you don't have the Renaissance app. That's ok. Don't panic, do not submit a ticket and they're still loading. So there is, and I linked it in the Q and A sheet. There is an actual system support page that you guys can see the loading status of different curriculums of different programs. Um And star is one of those that they are still loading students. So have no fear it will be loaded before you guys start taking benchmarks. But also don't panic if you don't see it yet, just keep checking back here and there and when it's green, it's all good to go and you guys can get in the name of your Renaissance app. Thank you Ben. All right guys. That's all we have for you today. So thank you again for joining us and we will see you next time.\"), (2175, 660, 4054, \"Hello, one tooth. I think you might be missing one. Yeah, I think we're waiting on clo. Ok. Ok. There we go. Ok, good afternoon. Epic. Hello. Hi. Uh very, very proud of you all. Um You guys jumped on those uh claiming your contact owners. Um I'm sure Dan and Willomena have told you about that. I'm gonna show you um a little bit of of why that's so important here in just a second. Um Let me show you the agenda. Uh Let me share my screen. So I went into your make sure you can see the screen now. So I went into your projects which you can always find underneath here in the upper right, right projects and let's make sure I can see all of you. Ok? Um I archived a whole bunch of projects. That's, this is just for Dan and will, I mean, is uh at some point we may have to come back to them with it and things like that, but they don't go away, they just get archived. Um I need to come back with Rob to work on this marketing one. I made a, a new one. which we could just do for meetings, uh called next, next set of priorities. We're gonna review our last training session, take a few minutes uh to make sure buddy, um is uh got their habits and that kind of thing. Um I'm gonna show you how you can start using templates. If you haven't already both in Gmail and in hubspot, it's the same uh thing. Uh And then everyone has some custom contact views. I'm going to show you how to um ba you have to install them because they're unique to your user. Um And then I want to look at tasks. Um And then there's a couple of things on the, the E signatures um that I need to go over as well. And then the, the stuff here at the bottom is for uh for Dan and Wilhelmina and I um but not necessarily you all, let's review what we did last week. Um Did everybody you have your inbox connected? I, I don't know how I can cause it's at the user level. Did anyone still need some help with that? It's ok. If you do, it's just important that we help you and get it done. Is any everybody good? Ok. All right. Um I think I might have missed telling you all this. Uh This could be on me is that there's a chrome extension. Um Does anyone remember installing the chrome extension if you did give me? Ok. Does anybody like I miss the chrome extension by good. Ok, then I need to show you just so that you can see, please ignore my email. Ok? I'm trusting you to not look at my email. Um Yeah, if if you, when you open a new email, the the way you can verify this is working is if you have this stuff because this stuff is from hubspot and where it's coming from is this chrome extension right up here. So if you are missing that, if you go to create an email and you're missing those things, the chrome extension isn't uh installed, can everyone check their email and also make sure you have log and track uh check. Thank you, Ashley for the thumbs up. Anybody. Everybody's got those checked. OK? All right, y'all are very disciplined in your meeting etiquette like everybody's on mute. Um Y'all must go through this a lot. Um uh And then that automatically connected your calendar which um might be important for your workflow might not. Um And then I see uh Dan a video this morning about two things that I needed you guys to do to keep moving on your signatures. Um Did every or did anyone not get to either view that or configure it because we can do it real fast. OK. Then thumbs up that you uh inputted those two signature. OK. Now, here's the real test. Thumbs up if you had problems getting your extension added to your main number. Ok. You are listening good. Um Yes, I don't know how to solve that yet. Uh I have to get with hubspot. It's a limitation of that field. They only allow 10 digits, which makes no sense. Um because that's your main line and lots of people have extensions. So I I there is a small work around, it's better than nothing but it will get there. Um And then I'm also contacting them to see if there's a work around that they know of. Um because it's certainly not on the configuration screen. Um And then everybody, it looks like you're claiming and assigning your contacts. Um You're updating your lead statuses now because you've done that I can create tasks that automate some things for you. Um Now that those are like in the right buckets, uh you like learned how to create a note and it looks like um I didn't spot check everybody, but it looks like everybody is creating notes. Um And then I might have not covered this one as strong, but this one is strong is important too, is that when you, when you log a call. Um And if you have those check box, sorry, that's from email. If you log when you make a call, you need to go into hubspot and, and click log call. Um And then you need to um do the outcomes um because we're using those as well and I'm gonna show you uh possibly. Um Dan, what did you decide on us demoing that? I definitely want you to demo the management KPIS because they will have access to that just so that they know and then we can talk about why some, some people have better results than others because II I hesitated. Iii I told Dan showing people this in the state that it's in is not completely accurate because not all of you have marked things the same and that kind of thing. So I don't want to put anybody on blast. That's not the, um, that's not the goal here. But what I wanna show you is once you do those outcomes, what's gonna happen is it's gonna populate some, some charts like this. And um, what we can do is Dan can reset these every week so that, um, you know, everybody's on the same, on the same playing field as far as if you need to get better, you'll have a chance to get better every seven days, um, uh on these things. So this is using all time, like if you've been in hubspot forever, um see date ranges all time. But uh so call outcomes, you can see we'll just go from this, this top one, it looks like uh connected and so you can kind of get a sense of, of what your calls are like. Um And then, you know how many there are that you've logged. Um, because this only reports on that call outcome when you log a call, uh, it doesn't know it doesn't have any other magic. So if you populate that you're gonna help, um, you're, you're gonna help. Uh, oh, looks like, ok, she got back up in there. Good job. Well, there's no value for it stands for. Um, that means that the call outcome wasn't, I, I it's blank by default because it wouldn't have a, it would not have any of these by default. So that just means you have some that are, you need to assign um no value 39 of these. Um And I can show you if, if you're, I'll make a video to show you how you can quickly identify those. So you don't have to go through every call um and find those. But yeah, that's what that means. It means nothing was assigned. Yep. Um So that can be really important. Um It can, it can, what's interesting is to see like for, for Dan and will mean they're looking at this. They, it would be interesting to see if most of you are having the same experience. Like most of the time you can get connected or most of the time you're having to leave voicemail, it's just gonna help them kind of understand what your day to day uh is, is like. Um and then uh task completed if you, once you log a call or do a note and there's a little check box there at the bottom that says um create task. That's probably what these are. Um I didn't dig in to see if they were manually created or, or created with that check box. But if you've been doing that when you log your calls and you, um and then you complete that task, it, that's gonna show up here. So it's also gonna give you um you know, some sense of, of what, how many more tasks you still have to go. Now, here's the danger. So bear with me. These are all the tasks that you uh with your check box said I wanna create that task. Now, when I create some workflows that do some task automation for you automatically, your number of not started is gonna jump up. So don't freak out like, oh gosh, I'm so far behind. Um It's just, that's, that's how it, that's how it works. It might create an like one more task for every contact that you have. So you may have, you know, 25 to 30. Um So I just don't want you to freak out next time you come on here and it's like I have 100 tests. I haven't started. That doesn't mean you're bad. Um It means the system's creating tasks for you. Um So there is that and then OK, what happened here? OK. Um Lead response time as is this isn't very accurate uh because we loaded in contacts and then we have some days before they were assigned. And so what we'll do after this call is over, we'll reset this and just kind of probably look at it as like this week moving on, that kind of thing so that everyone is on a level playing field. So that when you get a new task, this will show how fast, I mean, sorry, a new contact assigned to you or that you assign yourself to, this will show you, um, how fast do you do something? Whether or not it's logging a note making a call, um, anything. Um, but this is important. Um, sometimes, you know, when we look and we got, well, this says 11 days. Well, something's off. Um, but you, you all, are, you all are going pretty fast. Um, uh, I, I think Ashley's skewed because she had contacts assigned to her, like at the very, very beginning again, this will all get reset or, but it will be on the same playing field. Um, and then let me ask this from Dan and Willomena, this is what's called a sale, a service level agreement. What do you want your team's, uh, response time to be here? What do you think is appropriate so that they'll know what the expectation is. So once they're assigned to lead, um, you're asking me what the, what I would like, uh, you know, once it's assigned to, to be, uh, contacted within 24 hours. Ok. Ok. Well, then um, and if that's the case, then it's, uh it's gonna look, everybody's like if that's the expectation that's at least the goal. And so, uh hopefully next week everybody's is less than 24 hours. Um, and, and again, we'll reset all this, so this won't ding against you. Um, but this is another good tool for you to go. How fast am I getting this stuff? Um And, and that kind of thing. OK. Activities. Um These, this is an uh this is something that hubspot does factors in um automatically for me and um it's just a mix. Um So if you're logging calls and you're creating notes and you're creating tasks, it's got some stuff to work with here. Um It's uh and so again, this doesn't ding anyone today. Um But uh they need you to be logging calls and making your notes. Um And then I'm gonna talk you into using your task today um about how powerful that can be. Um So you'll get that. So that's just some tools for you all. Um that as you're using them and like doing the call outcomes. Um moving people from lead SQL QL to customer. Um I'm also gonna show you on the call outcome. I wanna review that again. Um because we added another outcome um that it will show up up here and it will be enrolled. So actually, let me do that right now. We added an outcome to call outcomes called enrolled in order for you to kind of get credit as far as the call outcome for you enrolled. Um, I'm gonna show you how to find your enrolled really fast and then just go back in there and adjust the call outcome uh to enrolled. Um, because then we can use two numbers to figure out how many have we enrolled? We've got the call call outcome and we got the number of people that are becoming customer. Um And so we want those to kind of, we want that data to, to um map. Ok, we scroll down here. Um, hold on first of all, let me, is it ok to give them all access. Now, Dan D do you want me to give him access or wait? Ok, let me do that right now. Uh, and still bar or wait till the data is a little cleaner. Uh Dan, could you hear me? Sorry. My internet said it was unstable. It doesn't, it doesn't really matter. He, he doesn't really uh checks this anyways, but uh we'll, we'll just wait. Uh ok. Now all of you have that which is up here and so you have Epic and you have management. Now let me show you. So this is really cool. This is, um, if you have marked the life cycle, uh, as uh from whatever kind of lead it was to customer enrolled, it's gonna show up here and I broke this down by your phone list. Um, so that we'll just know too. Where's the new enrollees coming from? Um, well, it looks like your un your unsure lists are really powerful. Um, and so, uh, learning that I'm gonna, as soon as I get those from Dan, I will get those up and in so that you can, you know, reaping the benefits of those. It looks, is David, your internet is really talking, getting some, uh, hm. um What can I do? I can, I'm not sure what to do. It's fine now and just every now and then it's choppy. I don't know what's going on. Ok. Now you're good. I'm wondering if it's uh if I make um people non video or me on video. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Uh Yeah, just when that happens. Give me one of these. Um So you can kinda see. So when we were talking about call outcomes being um uh needing to be updated to enrolled, this is where, so Lindsay go in here. Um And with my slow internet click Brook click Heather calls, logged call connected. Um It looks like she enrolled so you could go to enrolled, see how that works. Ok. Then that will populate that chart. Oh, so after you go call David left voice, it's really choppy right now. See when I see that, I wonder did they re enroll? Yeah. So I have a question about that. How about I restart the meeting? Can you hear me. Mhm. I had a question about, uh, how you figured out that, uh, uh, that person was, uh, uh, enrolled by, by seeing connected. I'm, I'm maybe, I'm sure I don't figure it out. The reps move this from marketing qualified lead or sales qualified lead to customer. So, however that happened, um, let's see here. I can check and see and maybe, um, who's the record owner of this? Lindsay? Um, yes. Ok. So Lindsay they confirmed to you that they enrolled. Yeah, they did. She has enrolled one student and then she's in the process of enrolling the other, but she said they're enrolled, but then she said that they're missing a document. So then we were going back and forth and I was trying to help her get the document nailed down. Um So one of them is enrolled and one of them is pending. Ok. But we are working to get this automated in hubspot where, you know, once it shows up in power school that they're in our system in the enrollment process then that, you know, we're working on getting that automated. So you got, so we will have to manually check it in power school. Yeah. Um Yes. So there are, there are those, so um you just need to the reps, you need to go in and click on um any of these numbers and then just update those call outcomes to enroll. Um Looks like Lindsay got 10 Tom you got 15 to do Ashley, you got 11. Um, and then as you go on, if somebody enrolls, update the life cycle stage and the call outcome, um, and I'll add that to your instructions, um, in your playbook as well. Uh, let's see, the other thing that I sent you, um, Dan, I don't know if you did, you, um, forward this on. If not, I can, um, send it to everybody. Uh, It would have been in an email a couple days ago maybe. Yeah, I have not forwarded that to. Ok. So we're gonna get this to you. This is how your hubspot portal is uh configured unique to Epic. Um And so it uses these three tools, marketing hub, sales hub and service hub. You guys don't have service hub but you might in the future. So it's there, the life cycle stages, you can see how, what we're doing is adapting hubspot's words to yours. So you're gonna see like your warm leads and your hot leads and then customer, your lead statuses um are are there um deal stages in the future? You're not using these right now and the way you all are working, you may not even need these. Um some sales teams use these. But I think this process that you guys are doing works well for you instead of um needing to, to, I'll demo what that could look like to Dan and Willomena. But I think it's I don't know if it's needed that this system that you've got going is um it's like the simpler, the better um kind of thing and then additional properties that we can use, uh you know, to look at things is which program they're in preferred method of communication, time language and then enrollment status. Um So I sent that, let me go back to projects and review where we were all outcomes. We had it enrolled. Ok, let me review the call script and the data hygiene. Just so everybody remembers where this is. Um if you go to any contact, it doesn't matter who it is in the right hand side here. Um There's this playbook which has your script, it has what to do after the call, log the call and know that I don't have this screenshot doesn't have enrolled. Um I can replace that if we really, if we need that, um send the confirmation email which you've been doing uh update lead status. Um And then if they become a customer um or enroll uh move whatever lead life cycle they're in to enroll. Um Let's see what else was in there. I think that was it. All right. Can I ask you something? Uh Where is the knowledge base at? Dan? You need to share you with that with Willomena. There is a knowledge base. Um It's in the playbooks, Willomena. That's where it's currently located. Yeah, you can use um you can use I mean, the, the, when we had Fa Qs, that's of your knowledge base. That's what this is. Ok. So we can make, uh, multiple playbooks in here. Ok. So we can, uh, we can, so how many is there a limit to that, or? No, I don't know. How many would you, I mean, I'm just, I'm just thinking if we can make playbooks of, uh, curriculum or curricula, uh, and, uh, different programs, you know, so that they can just click on it whenever they need it and it's easy and they have an easy overview to go to. Yes. Exactly. Right. If you've got information about additional programs, um, yeah, that would be a great, that'd be a good playbook and, and, and it's easy to, uh, to create those, uh, playbooks. Is that something that, uh, yeah, it's so easy. All right. Yeah, that, that's, we can figure that out. Ok. Yeah, it's cut and paste. It's so easy. It probably makes me look super smart but it's not, I think that will be the best way to do it. Uh, guys, if, if any of you have a better idea or suggestion, feel free to throw that out, uh, you know, later on. But I think that there will be a good way to work. Do you guys get, do you get lots of questions about the individual about programs and things like that? Are you, when you get questions, are you sharing those with Dan and Wilhelmina. So they could document them and make sure you guys have answers. Do you have a time to do that? I've got a spreadsheet that's a frequently asked questions that I've asked them to copy and paste the questions and the answers that they're getting asked. Um So that the whole team, yes, uh share that link with me and, um, well, the playbook we're just going to use for general uh um sources, you know, that uh we have, we have several programs and, and models that, that have, you know, that has a lot of information that we can just put in there so that they can go back there in case they need to refresh their minds, you know, where else would you, would they find that? Now? Well, uh we created um uh how do you call it um a doc, a Google doc for that. Uh And uh we have uh a binder with some information, but it needs to be updated. So it would be great if we have just one source that we can go to. Uh And that's why I was thinking about uh creating those. And uh we'll figure out a way that uh it will be uh clear what's in what and uh it's easy and easy accessible. Yeah. OK. So now at this point, um we are going to uh cover um using templates and custom contact views and tasks. Um We'll do that first. So uh let, let's start with contacts. I need a guinea pig because this is all going to be unique to you. So who, who would like that doesn't? Um Ashley, yours are already set up because I think I used, I ghosted as you. Um What a matter of fact, Ashley take yourself off me for a second when you saw that. Did that instantly make sense? Ok. Sorry y'all my multiple screens, I always lose my cursor. I'm still learning how to use that. That's why I make mine big and yellow. It's smart. Um yeah when it, when I first saw it, I I well I first noticed it uh I was looking through my s sent folder in my gmail to try and look for another for an email and I saw where it said I I emailed I guess I was emailing you and it had like blank spots in it and I go oh my gosh. Did I send out an email to like but yeah, but then I went through and looked and that was yeah it was really cool. So um yeah that was me testing. Ok, so I need a uh a a guinea pig someone to share their screen. Tom share your screen please and be on contacts and take yourself off meat share screen. Oh, I can't share it until you stop sharing. Ok. Can you see that? Yes. Right. Um You go to mine. Yeah. Ok, so go up in the black bar up at the top, at the very top, go to contacts and then click contacts. Ok, let's go. You're pretty close. Um, let's uh cursor over warm past students um, until you see an X. There you go, we're gonna take that away. Um, you really don't need a assign unassigned contacts. That's more for, for Dan to be looking at. Um, but you need my and my. Ok, so then we're gonna go to the right where it says a view, click on that. Ok? Standard on the left. You've already got my contacts. Now you need my recently. Now scroll down. Uh now add my uncontacted. OK? And then go back to the ad view and scroll down, needs email. Follow up. Hey A ne needs next action. So I will go backwards here a little bit, um needs next action if you, if you kinda scroll over this table. And so we can kinda, we can see like what the uh the table of the con contact. So we can see uh the last column. There you go. So next activity date is auto populated um by hubspot. If there's nothing in that, it's a sign to us that there, it might be missing some information, logging a call. Um, something because um, if you have a task, especially if you have a task to follow up and it's a phone that your next activity date is going to um populate there. Uh that just means you've got something there. OK. Tom, let's uh go back up to kind of that middle N A area where you see we're looking for my contacts. It's a tab, there you go. Um And let's, let's I would recommend this, this is up to you because all of this is movable. I would take the tab that says all contacts and I would move it all the way to the right. You don't need to see all. I mean, there's gonna be 5000 of them in here. Some of them you won't be dealing with. So you can either get rid of that as a sales rep, um or development rep, um or just kind of move it out of the way. Now, let's go to my contacts. These are the contacts, these are all that you have, um, claimed ownership of. So you have 100 and two. Um And then it'll tell you basically, it's gonna tell you the same things as these other views, but this is just the master view of it. All right, recently assigned. Let's click on that. I don't know how it defines recent, but um, these are, uh, as you can see, it looks like it's been assigned in the last week. So if you wanna look at what your recently assigned ones are, here's the most important tab, my uncontacted. So if you have a lead status of new, all of those are gonna end up here. And that's your, I mean, that's super important. That means they haven't been contacted at all. So this is a really easy way for you to work your uh list a little bit more um uh smarter in the sense. Uh Kidding. All right. Need some email. Follow up. So you have 23 that it's, it's, and I don't know how the system determines this. It may be the time period between the last email, but it's just trying to prompt you. So what you would do, let's just, um, uh, wait a minute. How did Kelly? Um oh, I have to, um, assign that. Ok. That's not a um, a my, all right, not a I can do that. It looks like that's everybody's in there. Um, but that's ok too because we'll just coach everybody to do that. So needs email. Follow up the next line down, go to contact owner and choose yourself Tom. Uh, no, not there. Uh, in the middle area. Go up about two inches, not there, uh, another inch up. It's the same like, yeah, and I go over like four things over to the left. Keep going. There you go. Contact owner now, ch just choose me. This is me. So. Oh yeah, yeah, it knows who you are. Ok. It looks like you only have seven that um, the system is saying, you know what you might wanna poke, you might want to send an email. Now, even the probably they're not interested. Uh Obviously, you know, could skip that but attempted to contact these need, they need something next. All right. Click over to go ahead if I've already sent an email to all these folks, but I did it through gmail. I just need to enter it. Um You could check to see that. Well, if your box were checked, log and track then the system knows that you sent it through Gmail. Let's just find out. I can't click but let's look at Lucia. Is she one that you thought that you know you? Ok, click on her name, not her email. There you go. Ok. All right. Yep. There it is. Yay. Ok. Well then you can skip that. Um again the system is just trying to help you like uh sometimes it's, I mean it's using a I who knows what, what's real here. All right. Go back to your contacts. Ok. Um so and owner there warm past you could probably go ahead and uh give it in. Yeah, I can't hear you. I know you want me to cook on this one. Yes. Ok. No, I mean um yes. Yes that yeah tell me when I'm back, you're back. Ok man. You know, I OK, I won't sweat it. Um ok, so for everyone else, let me coach you how to go do this and at least do these two, you'll go to your contacts. So everybody kinda do this as we're doing it um appear the blue contacts make sure you're in contacts. Uh Actually, you know what? Let me go ahead and do this Dan or uh Tom, go ahead and stop sharing and I'm gonna share. Yeah, screen share. There we go. OK? So as you can see, I don't have those chosen. So everybody go to contacts here, contacts and then contacts and then we're gonna go to a view and over here on standard, I would choose the three that says my for sure. And if you wanna do the others just know that you'll need to, um, choose you as the contact owner to see the view. But these three that say my are default, you just click those and that's your views. Anybody not seeing how to do that, there also will be a recording. Ok. Thumbs up if you've added any view. Ok. Great Carly. Yeah. All right. OK. Let me show you one more trick in any of these views. This can be, can become a good tool for you. You the ability to, um, with edit columns and I move my columns around all the time depending on, uh, what I need to see because some, you know, some of the columns, it goes pretty far. Um But if you like, for example, uh, you've got new contacts and they come up from the form, well, then it's gonna have preferred method. Um If you wanna see what all that stuff is before you get into the contact, go to edit columns, all of the columns that you're seeing are all here. So I'm just gonna pick one if I wanna know if they're epic or heritage right away. At first glance, I'm just gonna move that. So remember I moved program from down here to up here. So the expected behavior is now epic or heritage, this is gonna be in my second column. So then I apply that, see that. So now if that's important, so you just figure out what's important to you and then reorder them. Um Lead status may be the most important thing that you always want to see. Well, if that's the case, then lead status is right here. Um I, if that's what you wanna see first and just move it, you can also move them. No, you can't, you could do that. So you have to reorder them. Can anyone see how that might be helpful for any of your stuff? Um Anybody wanna come off mute and tell me how, how would you use that? I used it to um move because I had lead status on there, but it was also helpful to see who was enrolled. And so I added the life cycle stage to show up right there next to lead status. So I could see at a glance who's enrolled. Yes, like that. OK. Yeah, that's real smart. Yeah, that's real smart. That's good. And the, and, and the system lets each person make that decision. There's not really a global um like lockdown. You can decide how you wanna do that. All right, Ashley, we're gonna stick with you because I think you were doing tasks, you were working some of your tasks. All right. So if you will share your screen, ok. I think my neighbor kid. Yep. My neighbor is knocking on my door. So now my dogs are barking. I'm sorry, terrible timing. I, he, he's fine. He, he comes to my house and knocks on my door every day. Just say hi. He thinks my kids are home because they used to be. But now they're not, they're at the babysitter. They haven't figured it out yet. Uh, let me, is it ok if I just stick my dogs outside really quick, I'm sorry, not a problem. I will, uh, uh, since I'm still sharing, I will, I will get us there. All right. So tasks are in under sales. So everybody will go up here and go to sales and task and click on that and then give me a thumbs up if you see tasks on the, the left hand side. So I know you're in the right spot. Sorry, y'all, they had perfect timing. Ok. Ok. Uh Tom, did you get there? Ok. All right, Ashley, we went to sales and we went to tasks and then, then I want you to go ahead and share your screen because you have tasks and I don't. Um because you um it says like, oh yeah. Ok, quick check in. Are you learning things? Ok. I feel like a teacher during the pandemic. Um OK. So you share your screen. Um Can you see I shared the wrong screen? I guess your laptops? Ok. Y'all, I'm sorry. Let's see. Here we go. There we go. Can you see it now? Ok. Yeah, I just need to move it over here. All right. So bec and tell me this, these were created most likely because when you were doing a call outcome or a note, you check the box. Mhm. Yeah, I, I wasn't doing that initially. I've kind of started doing that with almost every phone call or mail that I make, I'm now like checking that box. But so some of these, I just went back later and said, hey, I wanna make sure I follow up with this person, you know, in three days. So, so in that sense, you went to their contact record and it created a task task. We, we'll do that next. Um So uh let's see here. Um Did you discover, see about half three quarter, one quarter of the way down on the screen? There's a blue button that says start six tasks, click that it won't hurt anything. But what this does is it puts you into a work mode of like serious concentration of just these are the people that you have tasks on. Um And so uh you can either reschedule this task up there, you can skip it and go to the next one or you can mark it complete. And that's how you mean you can whip through uh your, your to do list if you'll use, if you'll get task created. Um And if you'll create some, then you go into task and go. Uh let's let's start working these tasks. It will then make sure that you only see the contacts that you have marked um of having task super efficient. Um It will make sure if you will follow this, you'll get a, you'll get even more done. Um OK, let's uh pretend that with Joseph here, uh you logged a call, um You click the check box or, or you didn't. And so you wanna go back because for a lot of people, they might want to create a new task uh to, to follow up with one. So go to tasks and show us what you did to create that task just to create task. Oh gosh, my computer screens in the way I would just type in like call to verify enrollment and then just choose, you know how long and I've been setting a time because it pops up on my calendar for like, you know, whatever. And then sometimes I put the note but not always. And then if it needs to be a call or an email, you can, yeah, call or email. Um, and then, um, you can also set a reminder, um, the, these reminders if you set those, it's just going to, uh, it'll give you a little screen in your upper right hand corner of the, of the software. Um, and then if you need for, to do any notes. Um, so one of the things that, that, uh, we coach people on doing when you're creating your tasks, um, is don't like the task that's automatically created will say something like follow up with Joseph Hunt. Um I would always ways put email Joseph Hunt or call Joseph Hunt. Um, because, uh, the next step of this is I'm gonna not today, I'm gonna show you how to segment your emails from your calls. So then you can really rip things out. It's like, ok, I have 10 calls I need to make. Here's just people that I've said are gonna get calls. Um If that's how you want to operate, um, you can do that too. Um, ok, let's X out of that. Don't save it and stop sharing your screen. Get my. There it goes. Ok. So if I send you all the video on how to create a task like uh Ashley just did. Um II I, the homework will be is create some tasks. Um And let's see how, see how that goes. Let me go back to projects here. It's 347. Um We had it enrolled. Ok. Oh, templates. All right, let's let's do that. Ok? You know what I need Ashley, share your screen again and go to Gmail. This is one I can't demo for you because I don't have a sale seat and Dan can't either. Um So uh you want X out of your task view? The X is on the right hand side. Yeah. Now go to your Gmail within, within here or like my actual gmail. I'm gonna show you two ways. Um And I won't look at your emails. That's fine. Uh OK. Go to compose because that's all I need to see. Um All right. So let's send an email to David at bridge rev uh subject line test to. OK. Now hover over uh uh templates. There you go. And you've got three templates. Those are the recently used. Um One of those has a phone number in it. Can you scroll down the sample and we should be able to see this one. Does template two. All right, let's choose that one. So here's your work around. Hey, at least I'm not asking you to type all this. OK? So it pulled in her phone number, right? But you're just gonna have to cursor there and put ext 0.484 but I at least saved you 10 minutes on the email. Yeah. Um So that's better than nothing. Um I do want us to make sure that this link is going where you intended it to it's, it's really the login screen. Is that, so can you click on the link and Dan verify? Is that really, is that where you wanted people to go to? That's what was in the, in your um, I assume it is because I would guess that you all, when you're talking to people, you're gonna tell them, hey, we're gonna send you to our enrollment portal. If you don't have an account you're gonna need to account. Ok, then we're good. Ok. All right. Um Ashley, go back to your Gmail and everybody. I mean, this is pretty simple as far as these templates. Um You can also uh at least in Gmail if there's some wording. I mean, I don't know how much leeway this is really uh Dan and Wilhelmina's um purview and call, but you can save what you've um created in gmail as a, as a template in gmail too. Um You just have to access it differently. Um Yes sir. Question. Are these in Spanish as well? What are they in Spanish? Do you have them translated into Spanish as well? Ok. I was gonna ask that I can, I can translate in and send them to you or Tomkin. So if we could have that, it will be 1000% easier on us, translate it, get it to Dan, he'll send it to me and I will uh get it in here. It'll say template um uh heritage. I'll just use the same numbers like follow up uh those kinds of things. But I mean, yeah, it could be the same thing just in Spanish. Yeah, we can do that also. I've never done this but Ashley, I want you to click tasks in that little menu bar in the blue. Look out. So if you just wanted to stay in Gmail, you can stay in Gmail. Um Yeah, you can do that. All right. Now go back to actually go back to your hub spot and I want you to search for the Well, oh you're kinda cutting out. Can you say that one more time? The search is in the top? Sorry. Uh huh Yeah. Search for David Welch. David Welch. Search for David Welch. There you go. Um That's not you. That's not me. Uh search for. There you go. That'll work contacts David, do I? OK? No, not David. Dum, bro. That's not me. Go back uh Here. Do it again, David. There you go. Oh That, that right there. Yeah. OK. OK. Sorry, that's me. All right. Now I want you to go to emails in the middle, create an email templates um owner. All of you will have to adjust this. Um It's uh it's an just go to any click there. Now let's do template two. Follow up. Same one we looked at you'll just need to click in and add your extension. Um Yeah. Mm and II I see a problem with this one. Can I ask that you guys stay in Gmail until I tell bart differently? Um You guys probably aren't spotting what I'm seeing. It's ok. Uh But let me um uh I uh it's not pulling in the contact's first name at the top um And it's in the template, so I'm gonna have to get support to um figure that out. It makes no sense. Um Go ahead and send that, go ahead and send that to me. Um uh hit send, OK? In the signature, I didn't see uh Ashley's uh position either, is that something that uh was taken out or? Uh no, it's because it's down here in our next project item to uh uh to populate. And I think I'm gonna have to give you a video on that um to populate your supervisor information and, and that kind of stuff. So um yes, stay in gmail another day. Um I'm going to make you a video on how to populate the rest of your signature um because we had to create some custom stuff for you guys um to do that. And I will also check that template. You can start using tasks um create tasks, update your call outcomes if you haven't. Um Let me see here. Uh Ashley, can you stop sharing? Mhm And taste and how to, how to upload uh templates? That's something that we need to do separately. I take it uh like how to create a template how to upload the templates ourselves, the, the stuff that you're doing right now. Um Let me, we'll have to do everything independently. So how, how will we do that? Are you at? Are we at that point where you uh I mean, not at that point yet, but we, we for sure need to understand, you know what you do. Yeah, you all do. I was telling Dan at some point I won't be here so teach how to create templates. Ok? Some time before June 1st. Um ok, start using templates in gmail only not hubspot just yet. Um And let me sport missing first um contact first name. I need to fix that. Ok? I'm gonna send you a video on how to do this because we're running out of time. Um but it's ok because you're not gonna send out emails via hubspot in the next 24 hours. So um we'll make sure and get that uh done in the next 24 hours and then um uh something with just Bart and Wilhelmina is we're going to send out an email to 5000 people. Um It might get you some, some inquiries. It may not. We'll see. Um You mean Dan, right Dan. And I did. Yeah, but the email the email is from Bart is how I uh it's Bart's email. Yes, I will talk to Dan and will mean about that. Yeah. All right. What's your primary takeaway today? Start using tasks. Yeah. Yes, that's for sure. All the options. I hope you missed something. But on the templates, are those already on there or like from my email when I go to templates? Um, is that something that Ashley made up and already had set up on there or is there, is it automatic Lindsay, share your screen? She's like crap. I asked a question. No. Yeah. Sure. Screen. Right. All right. I didn't judge your email so don't judge mine. Ok. Ok. Hm. Ok. So we come down here in the email and then click templates one second. Is anyone else seeing her screen? There we go. Um ok. Yeah, you're at Gmail. Yes. Uh click templates. Um No. Ok. What you see when you click templates so I can go and create that but I don't know you shouldn't have to. Can you do me a favor and click off that box again and go real slow and click templates and let me see your cursor hitting the ok, Duke. All right. Um That means that I must have not made the templates available to. I need to check to make sure because I was testing as Ashley. I wonder if that's what happened. But does anyone else can every anyone else um check their Gmail and um click templates and see if anything I have access to all of them. Yeah, I do too. This is Yeah, Tom, you uh Carla. How about you guys? I don't Uh, Dan, you would not, you would not Tom, do you, you do? Ok. Um, ok, Lindsay. Lindsay, I need to sleuth while you're not. So, um, I, I can do that. Let me put that in my project. Carla doesn't have a seat yet so we have to still, uh, get that established for her. Carla. What, Carla doesn't have a seat yet? Oh, ok. Yeah. So that will be established in the next few weeks. Ok. Well, Carla, we need to get you a seat. Um, were, were you guys still working with, uh, hubspot on? Um, actually, I can look and see. I don't want to pull that up in front of you guys. That's your account information. And, ok, it looks like you were still working through, then you're adding a seat. Dan. Yeah, we're, we're in contract negotiations for the next fiscal year. So that's ok, Carla, they'll let you know. Ok, I have a question. Um, ok, so, uh, my contact Miss Jones last week, she did sign up her four students but she accidentally signed them up for this year. So today we met at lunch time and I just put this in my task that we had to withdraw her students and then we're reenroll in them. My question is because this contact was not generated through our lead system. Uh, where would I, who would you recommend that? I put the names of those students? Ok. The names of the students um, well, let's first find, let's first get you a contact first. Is it any, what's, what's Miss jones' first name? Sherry Jones? Ok. Right here. Sherry Jones. Ok. So she's in hubspot? Ok. Ok. So, did you then, um, add her manually? I did. Congratulations. That's added manually. Ok. That's good. So, your question is, is where would you put the names of the students? I just went ahead and go ahead. I'm sorry. II I have never, I, I don't, I, we're gonna have staff, Dan and Willena or the rest of the group. Are you even collecting names of students? And if in a question and if so where are you putting them? Are you all listing the names of students as you're enrolling them? I've just been trying to put it in the notes because I didn't know if there was a specific spot under the contact section, but that's the only the, you know, the caregivers are, are listed. Uh But as this is already a student um and it's not on the, on the warm or hotly uh list, maybe we need to create a separate list for uh um re involvement that goes to us because I'm sure that will happen more frequent in the, in the near future. Well, you do have, so we did, I apparently we did plan for this Carla um see about this contact if you come down here, student, first name, student, last name. Now, if there's multiple students, there's multiple students, uh probably just in a note. OK? Because the thing is, is you only want to put these in properties. If we're trying to query against a property or find something, um, in, in, in your database, your student names don't necessarily matter. Um, in this database speaking correctly. Dan, that the student names really don't, you're not gonna do anything with those because we're contacting the caregiver. That's right. So the caregiver would be the trigger that would activate the list or whatever, how we're keeping it with data and information because the caregiver has the names all underneath. OK? I got it. OK? So I'll just put it in the notes because it really kinda from what I'm guessing won't really matter until the enrollment process. Um I'm guessing that's, and then it looks like uh Carl, I have a question. I like how, so you're using, um you're using like everything uh open deal and progress. That's good. Um What does open deal mean to you? I absolutely love this. Let me tell you. Um It just means I'm still working on it for me. That's what that means. Uh I love the timeline. You can click on that timeline, you can see everything you've done. I mean, this is just amazing. I really like it. I like it good. All right. Our time is up. I've got my homework, you've got your homework. I have a video to make you um I'm going to, I need to get with support on the that template. So you can be using in, in hubspot the video, I'm gonna make, you will help you finish out your E cigs. Um And then with that template fixed and then also with uh Lindsay, I'm gonna figure out why you don't have access to templates. Um uh We'll see because I don't know anything else. I think this is just for the future when, uh, um, power school is connected to a hubspot. Um, would it be easy then to, to, um, create reports, uh, that we have percentages, uh, of enrollments per, um, per list or is that something that's hard? Um, it can be done. I think what you're asking is, are you asking how many students got enrolled from a particular list? Exactly. Yes. Yeah. Uh, we can actually, um, but that's for, for the future when everything is working correctly, obviously. But that would be great. You can start. Yeah. And you can kind of start doing that now even just manually as far as, um, uh, yeah, but the, the, the number of enrollments are not, um, 100% right at this point, we still have to check certain things. So we just have to wait till everything is, everything is accurate. But that would be really great. Yeah. So we can run weekly reports to see what the percentage is conversion rate they call it. Huh? There it is. Um ok, I think I know what you're, you're trying to get to is we want a percentage and not just a number. Um, in a way it's uh kind of built off of the same logic as this. Um uh Yeah, so we just need a starting number and math. So the, the numbers that are listed here are all correct. They are correct in as much as the system has been. If people, if they're marked customer dash enrolled, that's what this is reflecting. Now, whether or not that record is customer dash enrolled. There's the human element. So I can't, I can't vouch that it, that it's correct. Um That part of it on, you know, is dependent on you guys. Awesome, Kelly, by the way, Kelly's on a roll, Kelly's on a roll. I spoke to Dan earlier. I think a few of those I did go back and change because I have been having a little bit of trouble with the power school. So that why? So after we do the next um training, I think what I'd like to do is a, um, what we call office hours. Um And you basically just bring your questions. Um And then that way you will also show me like maybe what we haven't covered. Well, we might see some patterns but um, so be thinking of, of that. That'll be, it'll what is today Wednesday? Um Let's shoot for that on uh I'll Well, Friday, um uh for office hours and we'll just do it for 30 minutes and, and not an hour. But then that way, um I won't have an agenda. Uh And you guys can just shoot questions or troubleshooting or, or that kind of thing. Um And then we'll, uh and then I'll train on the next batch of what gets configured. David. I just also wanted to say that according to these KP I management dashboard, um it's very important to emphasize that the data is, is entered into hubspot because that is what's generating these reports. And if you don't put the data in, then it's not gonna reflect very well on you. So we need you, we need you to put, do those tasks. We, we needed you to, to uh put in all the data that, you know, you're getting from this training and the previous training because if that data is not input, then it's not gonna reflect uh whether or not, you know, the, whether or not you're, you're, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. So um this is the only way we can, you know, monitor. So we, we need, it's, it's so important that you um input that data uh because if you don't, then it's gonna show that you didn't and then it's not gonna reflect very well. So I just want to reemphasize that and it's just clear for everybody how to do that right at this point. Yeah, this is all call outcomes. Well, I, sorry, I can't answer that. The team has to answer that. Sorry. No, I'm, I'm, I'm referring to that other list where, where there were no tasks. Yeah. The tasks, um, shallow and, uh, and tom, the test completed. Oh, it just means he, um, Tom, an easy way to do that is when you're logging anything, check the check box. I wasn't creating as many tests but, I mean, I did create a few. Um which is why it probably shows such a little number. But yeah, I've been, I've been creating some. Ok. So you know how to. Ok, perfect. Yeah, because I think right now we're not, no one's getting judged on these numbers. Yeah, we wanna make sure that you know how to use it. So then when we reset this to um, it'll be like this week, then again everybody start from scratch. Um And then you will know how you're doing. Ok. All right. I will send the link uh to this recording uh to Mr Dan here in a few minutes once it renders and is ready. Ok. Well, thank you for your time and for the explanation. Um I, I take it that um, I always, I always like to look really far away so, um far ahead, I guess, but um when things are being transferred, you're going to give us all those um those awesome videos about how to do what? Right. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. That's all I had. Ok. The great thing is technically you all have me until July 7th, right? Yeah, that's a good thing. This was enough for you, but for us, it is. I was sharing with Dan that uh I, I kind of welcomed this. This has gone a lot faster than because we usually take the full 90 days and it's because we are juggling about 70 clients. But I wanted to see is it possible to go faster? It, it always is, always is. And so you all helped me as well have an experiment to where um instead of us trying to cover every single thing in the world, which is what we do most of the time is just go, how do you need to use it? Let's set that up and then, you know, train on it um and use it, get feedback from users. Um and then move on. Yeah, we're blessed with a very smart team. So it goes fast. Yeah, that, that's awesome. Thank you so much. See you. Bye bye bye Dan. We'll talk again in the morning. OK. OK. Thank you.\"), (2176, 660, 4054, \"Hello, one tooth. I think you might be missing one. Yeah, I think we're waiting on clo. Ok. Ok. There we go. Ok, good afternoon. Epic. Hello. Hi. Uh very, very proud of you all. Um You guys jumped on those uh claiming your contact owners. Um I'm sure Dan and Willomena have told you about that. I'm gonna show you um a little bit of of why that's so important here in just a second. Um Let me show you the agenda. Uh Let me share my screen. So I went into your make sure you can see the screen now. So I went into your projects which you can always find underneath here in the upper right, right projects and let's make sure I can see all of you. Ok? Um I archived a whole bunch of projects. That's, this is just for Dan and will, I mean, is uh at some point we may have to come back to them with it and things like that, but they don't go away, they just get archived. Um I need to come back with Rob to work on this marketing one. I made a, a new one. which we could just do for meetings, uh called next, next set of priorities. We're gonna review our last training session, take a few minutes uh to make sure buddy, um is uh got their habits and that kind of thing. Um I'm gonna show you how you can start using templates. If you haven't already both in Gmail and in hubspot, it's the same uh thing. Uh And then everyone has some custom contact views. I'm going to show you how to um ba you have to install them because they're unique to your user. Um And then I want to look at tasks. Um And then there's a couple of things on the, the E signatures um that I need to go over as well. And then the, the stuff here at the bottom is for uh for Dan and Wilhelmina and I um but not necessarily you all, let's review what we did last week. Um Did everybody you have your inbox connected? I, I don't know how I can cause it's at the user level. Did anyone still need some help with that? It's ok. If you do, it's just important that we help you and get it done. Is any everybody good? Ok. All right. Um I think I might have missed telling you all this. Uh This could be on me is that there's a chrome extension. Um Does anyone remember installing the chrome extension if you did give me? Ok. Does anybody like I miss the chrome extension by good. Ok, then I need to show you just so that you can see, please ignore my email. Ok? I'm trusting you to not look at my email. Um Yeah, if if you, when you open a new email, the the way you can verify this is working is if you have this stuff because this stuff is from hubspot and where it's coming from is this chrome extension right up here. So if you are missing that, if you go to create an email and you're missing those things, the chrome extension isn't uh installed, can everyone check their email and also make sure you have log and track uh check. Thank you, Ashley for the thumbs up. Anybody. Everybody's got those checked. OK? All right, y'all are very disciplined in your meeting etiquette like everybody's on mute. Um Y'all must go through this a lot. Um uh And then that automatically connected your calendar which um might be important for your workflow might not. Um And then I see uh Dan a video this morning about two things that I needed you guys to do to keep moving on your signatures. Um Did every or did anyone not get to either view that or configure it because we can do it real fast. OK. Then thumbs up that you uh inputted those two signature. OK. Now, here's the real test. Thumbs up if you had problems getting your extension added to your main number. Ok. You are listening good. Um Yes, I don't know how to solve that yet. Uh I have to get with hubspot. It's a limitation of that field. They only allow 10 digits, which makes no sense. Um because that's your main line and lots of people have extensions. So I I there is a small work around, it's better than nothing but it will get there. Um And then I'm also contacting them to see if there's a work around that they know of. Um because it's certainly not on the configuration screen. Um And then everybody, it looks like you're claiming and assigning your contacts. Um You're updating your lead statuses now because you've done that I can create tasks that automate some things for you. Um Now that those are like in the right buckets, uh you like learned how to create a note and it looks like um I didn't spot check everybody, but it looks like everybody is creating notes. Um And then I might have not covered this one as strong, but this one is strong is important too, is that when you, when you log a call. Um And if you have those check box, sorry, that's from email. If you log when you make a call, you need to go into hubspot and, and click log call. Um And then you need to um do the outcomes um because we're using those as well and I'm gonna show you uh possibly. Um Dan, what did you decide on us demoing that? I definitely want you to demo the management KPIS because they will have access to that just so that they know and then we can talk about why some, some people have better results than others because II I hesitated. Iii I told Dan showing people this in the state that it's in is not completely accurate because not all of you have marked things the same and that kind of thing. So I don't want to put anybody on blast. That's not the, um, that's not the goal here. But what I wanna show you is once you do those outcomes, what's gonna happen is it's gonna populate some, some charts like this. And um, what we can do is Dan can reset these every week so that, um, you know, everybody's on the same, on the same playing field as far as if you need to get better, you'll have a chance to get better every seven days, um, uh on these things. So this is using all time, like if you've been in hubspot forever, um see date ranges all time. But uh so call outcomes, you can see we'll just go from this, this top one, it looks like uh connected and so you can kind of get a sense of, of what your calls are like. Um And then, you know how many there are that you've logged. Um, because this only reports on that call outcome when you log a call, uh, it doesn't know it doesn't have any other magic. So if you populate that you're gonna help, um, you're, you're gonna help. Uh, oh, looks like, ok, she got back up in there. Good job. Well, there's no value for it stands for. Um, that means that the call outcome wasn't, I, I it's blank by default because it wouldn't have a, it would not have any of these by default. So that just means you have some that are, you need to assign um no value 39 of these. Um And I can show you if, if you're, I'll make a video to show you how you can quickly identify those. So you don't have to go through every call um and find those. But yeah, that's what that means. It means nothing was assigned. Yep. Um So that can be really important. Um It can, it can, what's interesting is to see like for, for Dan and will mean they're looking at this. They, it would be interesting to see if most of you are having the same experience. Like most of the time you can get connected or most of the time you're having to leave voicemail, it's just gonna help them kind of understand what your day to day uh is, is like. Um and then uh task completed if you, once you log a call or do a note and there's a little check box there at the bottom that says um create task. That's probably what these are. Um I didn't dig in to see if they were manually created or, or created with that check box. But if you've been doing that when you log your calls and you, um and then you complete that task, it, that's gonna show up here. So it's also gonna give you um you know, some sense of, of what, how many more tasks you still have to go. Now, here's the danger. So bear with me. These are all the tasks that you uh with your check box said I wanna create that task. Now, when I create some workflows that do some task automation for you automatically, your number of not started is gonna jump up. So don't freak out like, oh gosh, I'm so far behind. Um It's just, that's, that's how it, that's how it works. It might create an like one more task for every contact that you have. So you may have, you know, 25 to 30. Um So I just don't want you to freak out next time you come on here and it's like I have 100 tests. I haven't started. That doesn't mean you're bad. Um It means the system's creating tasks for you. Um So there is that and then OK, what happened here? OK. Um Lead response time as is this isn't very accurate uh because we loaded in contacts and then we have some days before they were assigned. And so what we'll do after this call is over, we'll reset this and just kind of probably look at it as like this week moving on, that kind of thing so that everyone is on a level playing field. So that when you get a new task, this will show how fast, I mean, sorry, a new contact assigned to you or that you assign yourself to, this will show you, um, how fast do you do something? Whether or not it's logging a note making a call, um, anything. Um, but this is important. Um, sometimes, you know, when we look and we got, well, this says 11 days. Well, something's off. Um, but you, you all, are, you all are going pretty fast. Um, uh, I, I think Ashley's skewed because she had contacts assigned to her, like at the very, very beginning again, this will all get reset or, but it will be on the same playing field. Um, and then let me ask this from Dan and Willomena, this is what's called a sale, a service level agreement. What do you want your team's, uh, response time to be here? What do you think is appropriate so that they'll know what the expectation is. So once they're assigned to lead, um, you're asking me what the, what I would like, uh, you know, once it's assigned to, to be, uh, contacted within 24 hours. Ok. Ok. Well, then um, and if that's the case, then it's, uh it's gonna look, everybody's like if that's the expectation that's at least the goal. And so, uh hopefully next week everybody's is less than 24 hours. Um, and, and again, we'll reset all this, so this won't ding against you. Um, but this is another good tool for you to go. How fast am I getting this stuff? Um And, and that kind of thing. OK. Activities. Um These, this is an uh this is something that hubspot does factors in um automatically for me and um it's just a mix. Um So if you're logging calls and you're creating notes and you're creating tasks, it's got some stuff to work with here. Um It's uh and so again, this doesn't ding anyone today. Um But uh they need you to be logging calls and making your notes. Um And then I'm gonna talk you into using your task today um about how powerful that can be. Um So you'll get that. So that's just some tools for you all. Um that as you're using them and like doing the call outcomes. Um moving people from lead SQL QL to customer. Um I'm also gonna show you on the call outcome. I wanna review that again. Um because we added another outcome um that it will show up up here and it will be enrolled. So actually, let me do that right now. We added an outcome to call outcomes called enrolled in order for you to kind of get credit as far as the call outcome for you enrolled. Um, I'm gonna show you how to find your enrolled really fast and then just go back in there and adjust the call outcome uh to enrolled. Um, because then we can use two numbers to figure out how many have we enrolled? We've got the call call outcome and we got the number of people that are becoming customer. Um And so we want those to kind of, we want that data to, to um map. Ok, we scroll down here. Um, hold on first of all, let me, is it ok to give them all access. Now, Dan D do you want me to give him access or wait? Ok, let me do that right now. Uh, and still bar or wait till the data is a little cleaner. Uh Dan, could you hear me? Sorry. My internet said it was unstable. It doesn't, it doesn't really matter. He, he doesn't really uh checks this anyways, but uh we'll, we'll just wait. Uh ok. Now all of you have that which is up here and so you have Epic and you have management. Now let me show you. So this is really cool. This is, um, if you have marked the life cycle, uh, as uh from whatever kind of lead it was to customer enrolled, it's gonna show up here and I broke this down by your phone list. Um, so that we'll just know too. Where's the new enrollees coming from? Um, well, it looks like your un your unsure lists are really powerful. Um, and so, uh, learning that I'm gonna, as soon as I get those from Dan, I will get those up and in so that you can, you know, reaping the benefits of those. It looks, is David, your internet is really talking, getting some, uh, hm. um What can I do? I can, I'm not sure what to do. It's fine now and just every now and then it's choppy. I don't know what's going on. Ok. Now you're good. I'm wondering if it's uh if I make um people non video or me on video. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Uh Yeah, just when that happens. Give me one of these. Um So you can kinda see. So when we were talking about call outcomes being um uh needing to be updated to enrolled, this is where, so Lindsay go in here. Um And with my slow internet click Brook click Heather calls, logged call connected. Um It looks like she enrolled so you could go to enrolled, see how that works. Ok. Then that will populate that chart. Oh, so after you go call David left voice, it's really choppy right now. See when I see that, I wonder did they re enroll? Yeah. So I have a question about that. How about I restart the meeting? Can you hear me. Mhm. I had a question about, uh, how you figured out that, uh, uh, that person was, uh, uh, enrolled by, by seeing connected. I'm, I'm maybe, I'm sure I don't figure it out. The reps move this from marketing qualified lead or sales qualified lead to customer. So, however that happened, um, let's see here. I can check and see and maybe, um, who's the record owner of this? Lindsay? Um, yes. Ok. So Lindsay they confirmed to you that they enrolled. Yeah, they did. She has enrolled one student and then she's in the process of enrolling the other, but she said they're enrolled, but then she said that they're missing a document. So then we were going back and forth and I was trying to help her get the document nailed down. Um So one of them is enrolled and one of them is pending. Ok. But we are working to get this automated in hubspot where, you know, once it shows up in power school that they're in our system in the enrollment process then that, you know, we're working on getting that automated. So you got, so we will have to manually check it in power school. Yeah. Um Yes. So there are, there are those, so um you just need to the reps, you need to go in and click on um any of these numbers and then just update those call outcomes to enroll. Um Looks like Lindsay got 10 Tom you got 15 to do Ashley, you got 11. Um, and then as you go on, if somebody enrolls, update the life cycle stage and the call outcome, um, and I'll add that to your instructions, um, in your playbook as well. Uh, let's see, the other thing that I sent you, um, Dan, I don't know if you did, you, um, forward this on. If not, I can, um, send it to everybody. Uh, It would have been in an email a couple days ago maybe. Yeah, I have not forwarded that to. Ok. So we're gonna get this to you. This is how your hubspot portal is uh configured unique to Epic. Um And so it uses these three tools, marketing hub, sales hub and service hub. You guys don't have service hub but you might in the future. So it's there, the life cycle stages, you can see how, what we're doing is adapting hubspot's words to yours. So you're gonna see like your warm leads and your hot leads and then customer, your lead statuses um are are there um deal stages in the future? You're not using these right now and the way you all are working, you may not even need these. Um some sales teams use these. But I think this process that you guys are doing works well for you instead of um needing to, to, I'll demo what that could look like to Dan and Willomena. But I think it's I don't know if it's needed that this system that you've got going is um it's like the simpler, the better um kind of thing and then additional properties that we can use, uh you know, to look at things is which program they're in preferred method of communication, time language and then enrollment status. Um So I sent that, let me go back to projects and review where we were all outcomes. We had it enrolled. Ok, let me review the call script and the data hygiene. Just so everybody remembers where this is. Um if you go to any contact, it doesn't matter who it is in the right hand side here. Um There's this playbook which has your script, it has what to do after the call, log the call and know that I don't have this screenshot doesn't have enrolled. Um I can replace that if we really, if we need that, um send the confirmation email which you've been doing uh update lead status. Um And then if they become a customer um or enroll uh move whatever lead life cycle they're in to enroll. Um Let's see what else was in there. I think that was it. All right. Can I ask you something? Uh Where is the knowledge base at? Dan? You need to share you with that with Willomena. There is a knowledge base. Um It's in the playbooks, Willomena. That's where it's currently located. Yeah, you can use um you can use I mean, the, the, when we had Fa Qs, that's of your knowledge base. That's what this is. Ok. So we can make, uh, multiple playbooks in here. Ok. So we can, uh, we can, so how many is there a limit to that, or? No, I don't know. How many would you, I mean, I'm just, I'm just thinking if we can make playbooks of, uh, curriculum or curricula, uh, and, uh, different programs, you know, so that they can just click on it whenever they need it and it's easy and they have an easy overview to go to. Yes. Exactly. Right. If you've got information about additional programs, um, yeah, that would be a great, that'd be a good playbook and, and, and it's easy to, uh, to create those, uh, playbooks. Is that something that, uh, yeah, it's so easy. All right. Yeah, that, that's, we can figure that out. Ok. Yeah, it's cut and paste. It's so easy. It probably makes me look super smart but it's not, I think that will be the best way to do it. Uh, guys, if, if any of you have a better idea or suggestion, feel free to throw that out, uh, you know, later on. But I think that there will be a good way to work. Do you guys get, do you get lots of questions about the individual about programs and things like that? Are you, when you get questions, are you sharing those with Dan and Wilhelmina. So they could document them and make sure you guys have answers. Do you have a time to do that? I've got a spreadsheet that's a frequently asked questions that I've asked them to copy and paste the questions and the answers that they're getting asked. Um So that the whole team, yes, uh share that link with me and, um, well, the playbook we're just going to use for general uh um sources, you know, that uh we have, we have several programs and, and models that, that have, you know, that has a lot of information that we can just put in there so that they can go back there in case they need to refresh their minds, you know, where else would you, would they find that? Now? Well, uh we created um uh how do you call it um a doc, a Google doc for that. Uh And uh we have uh a binder with some information, but it needs to be updated. So it would be great if we have just one source that we can go to. Uh And that's why I was thinking about uh creating those. And uh we'll figure out a way that uh it will be uh clear what's in what and uh it's easy and easy accessible. Yeah. OK. So now at this point, um we are going to uh cover um using templates and custom contact views and tasks. Um We'll do that first. So uh let, let's start with contacts. I need a guinea pig because this is all going to be unique to you. So who, who would like that doesn't? Um Ashley, yours are already set up because I think I used, I ghosted as you. Um What a matter of fact, Ashley take yourself off me for a second when you saw that. Did that instantly make sense? Ok. Sorry y'all my multiple screens, I always lose my cursor. I'm still learning how to use that. That's why I make mine big and yellow. It's smart. Um yeah when it, when I first saw it, I I well I first noticed it uh I was looking through my s sent folder in my gmail to try and look for another for an email and I saw where it said I I emailed I guess I was emailing you and it had like blank spots in it and I go oh my gosh. Did I send out an email to like but yeah, but then I went through and looked and that was yeah it was really cool. So um yeah that was me testing. Ok, so I need a uh a a guinea pig someone to share their screen. Tom share your screen please and be on contacts and take yourself off meat share screen. Oh, I can't share it until you stop sharing. Ok. Can you see that? Yes. Right. Um You go to mine. Yeah. Ok, so go up in the black bar up at the top, at the very top, go to contacts and then click contacts. Ok, let's go. You're pretty close. Um, let's uh cursor over warm past students um, until you see an X. There you go, we're gonna take that away. Um, you really don't need a assign unassigned contacts. That's more for, for Dan to be looking at. Um, but you need my and my. Ok, so then we're gonna go to the right where it says a view, click on that. Ok? Standard on the left. You've already got my contacts. Now you need my recently. Now scroll down. Uh now add my uncontacted. OK? And then go back to the ad view and scroll down, needs email. Follow up. Hey A ne needs next action. So I will go backwards here a little bit, um needs next action if you, if you kinda scroll over this table. And so we can kinda, we can see like what the uh the table of the con contact. So we can see uh the last column. There you go. So next activity date is auto populated um by hubspot. If there's nothing in that, it's a sign to us that there, it might be missing some information, logging a call. Um, something because um, if you have a task, especially if you have a task to follow up and it's a phone that your next activity date is going to um populate there. Uh that just means you've got something there. OK. Tom, let's uh go back up to kind of that middle N A area where you see we're looking for my contacts. It's a tab, there you go. Um And let's, let's I would recommend this, this is up to you because all of this is movable. I would take the tab that says all contacts and I would move it all the way to the right. You don't need to see all. I mean, there's gonna be 5000 of them in here. Some of them you won't be dealing with. So you can either get rid of that as a sales rep, um or development rep, um or just kind of move it out of the way. Now, let's go to my contacts. These are the contacts, these are all that you have, um, claimed ownership of. So you have 100 and two. Um And then it'll tell you basically, it's gonna tell you the same things as these other views, but this is just the master view of it. All right, recently assigned. Let's click on that. I don't know how it defines recent, but um, these are, uh, as you can see, it looks like it's been assigned in the last week. So if you wanna look at what your recently assigned ones are, here's the most important tab, my uncontacted. So if you have a lead status of new, all of those are gonna end up here. And that's your, I mean, that's super important. That means they haven't been contacted at all. So this is a really easy way for you to work your uh list a little bit more um uh smarter in the sense. Uh Kidding. All right. Need some email. Follow up. So you have 23 that it's, it's, and I don't know how the system determines this. It may be the time period between the last email, but it's just trying to prompt you. So what you would do, let's just, um, uh, wait a minute. How did Kelly? Um oh, I have to, um, assign that. Ok. That's not a um, a my, all right, not a I can do that. It looks like that's everybody's in there. Um, but that's ok too because we'll just coach everybody to do that. So needs email. Follow up the next line down, go to contact owner and choose yourself Tom. Uh, no, not there. Uh, in the middle area. Go up about two inches, not there, uh, another inch up. It's the same like, yeah, and I go over like four things over to the left. Keep going. There you go. Contact owner now, ch just choose me. This is me. So. Oh yeah, yeah, it knows who you are. Ok. It looks like you only have seven that um, the system is saying, you know what you might wanna poke, you might want to send an email. Now, even the probably they're not interested. Uh Obviously, you know, could skip that but attempted to contact these need, they need something next. All right. Click over to go ahead if I've already sent an email to all these folks, but I did it through gmail. I just need to enter it. Um You could check to see that. Well, if your box were checked, log and track then the system knows that you sent it through Gmail. Let's just find out. I can't click but let's look at Lucia. Is she one that you thought that you know you? Ok, click on her name, not her email. There you go. Ok. All right. Yep. There it is. Yay. Ok. Well then you can skip that. Um again the system is just trying to help you like uh sometimes it's, I mean it's using a I who knows what, what's real here. All right. Go back to your contacts. Ok. Um so and owner there warm past you could probably go ahead and uh give it in. Yeah, I can't hear you. I know you want me to cook on this one. Yes. Ok. No, I mean um yes. Yes that yeah tell me when I'm back, you're back. Ok man. You know, I OK, I won't sweat it. Um ok, so for everyone else, let me coach you how to go do this and at least do these two, you'll go to your contacts. So everybody kinda do this as we're doing it um appear the blue contacts make sure you're in contacts. Uh Actually, you know what? Let me go ahead and do this Dan or uh Tom, go ahead and stop sharing and I'm gonna share. Yeah, screen share. There we go. OK? So as you can see, I don't have those chosen. So everybody go to contacts here, contacts and then contacts and then we're gonna go to a view and over here on standard, I would choose the three that says my for sure. And if you wanna do the others just know that you'll need to, um, choose you as the contact owner to see the view. But these three that say my are default, you just click those and that's your views. Anybody not seeing how to do that, there also will be a recording. Ok. Thumbs up if you've added any view. Ok. Great Carly. Yeah. All right. OK. Let me show you one more trick in any of these views. This can be, can become a good tool for you. You the ability to, um, with edit columns and I move my columns around all the time depending on, uh, what I need to see because some, you know, some of the columns, it goes pretty far. Um But if you like, for example, uh, you've got new contacts and they come up from the form, well, then it's gonna have preferred method. Um If you wanna see what all that stuff is before you get into the contact, go to edit columns, all of the columns that you're seeing are all here. So I'm just gonna pick one if I wanna know if they're epic or heritage right away. At first glance, I'm just gonna move that. So remember I moved program from down here to up here. So the expected behavior is now epic or heritage, this is gonna be in my second column. So then I apply that, see that. So now if that's important, so you just figure out what's important to you and then reorder them. Um Lead status may be the most important thing that you always want to see. Well, if that's the case, then lead status is right here. Um I, if that's what you wanna see first and just move it, you can also move them. No, you can't, you could do that. So you have to reorder them. Can anyone see how that might be helpful for any of your stuff? Um Anybody wanna come off mute and tell me how, how would you use that? I used it to um move because I had lead status on there, but it was also helpful to see who was enrolled. And so I added the life cycle stage to show up right there next to lead status. So I could see at a glance who's enrolled. Yes, like that. OK. Yeah, that's real smart. Yeah, that's real smart. That's good. And the, and, and the system lets each person make that decision. There's not really a global um like lockdown. You can decide how you wanna do that. All right, Ashley, we're gonna stick with you because I think you were doing tasks, you were working some of your tasks. All right. So if you will share your screen, ok. I think my neighbor kid. Yep. My neighbor is knocking on my door. So now my dogs are barking. I'm sorry, terrible timing. I, he, he's fine. He, he comes to my house and knocks on my door every day. Just say hi. He thinks my kids are home because they used to be. But now they're not, they're at the babysitter. They haven't figured it out yet. Uh, let me, is it ok if I just stick my dogs outside really quick, I'm sorry, not a problem. I will, uh, uh, since I'm still sharing, I will, I will get us there. All right. So tasks are in under sales. So everybody will go up here and go to sales and task and click on that and then give me a thumbs up if you see tasks on the, the left hand side. So I know you're in the right spot. Sorry, y'all, they had perfect timing. Ok. Ok. Uh Tom, did you get there? Ok. All right, Ashley, we went to sales and we went to tasks and then, then I want you to go ahead and share your screen because you have tasks and I don't. Um because you um it says like, oh yeah. Ok, quick check in. Are you learning things? Ok. I feel like a teacher during the pandemic. Um OK. So you share your screen. Um Can you see I shared the wrong screen? I guess your laptops? Ok. Y'all, I'm sorry. Let's see. Here we go. There we go. Can you see it now? Ok. Yeah, I just need to move it over here. All right. So bec and tell me this, these were created most likely because when you were doing a call outcome or a note, you check the box. Mhm. Yeah, I, I wasn't doing that initially. I've kind of started doing that with almost every phone call or mail that I make, I'm now like checking that box. But so some of these, I just went back later and said, hey, I wanna make sure I follow up with this person, you know, in three days. So, so in that sense, you went to their contact record and it created a task task. We, we'll do that next. Um So uh let's see here. Um Did you discover, see about half three quarter, one quarter of the way down on the screen? There's a blue button that says start six tasks, click that it won't hurt anything. But what this does is it puts you into a work mode of like serious concentration of just these are the people that you have tasks on. Um And so uh you can either reschedule this task up there, you can skip it and go to the next one or you can mark it complete. And that's how you mean you can whip through uh your, your to do list if you'll use, if you'll get task created. Um And if you'll create some, then you go into task and go. Uh let's let's start working these tasks. It will then make sure that you only see the contacts that you have marked um of having task super efficient. Um It will make sure if you will follow this, you'll get a, you'll get even more done. Um OK, let's uh pretend that with Joseph here, uh you logged a call, um You click the check box or, or you didn't. And so you wanna go back because for a lot of people, they might want to create a new task uh to, to follow up with one. So go to tasks and show us what you did to create that task just to create task. Oh gosh, my computer screens in the way I would just type in like call to verify enrollment and then just choose, you know how long and I've been setting a time because it pops up on my calendar for like, you know, whatever. And then sometimes I put the note but not always. And then if it needs to be a call or an email, you can, yeah, call or email. Um, and then, um, you can also set a reminder, um, the, these reminders if you set those, it's just going to, uh, it'll give you a little screen in your upper right hand corner of the, of the software. Um, and then if you need for, to do any notes. Um, so one of the things that, that, uh, we coach people on doing when you're creating your tasks, um, is don't like the task that's automatically created will say something like follow up with Joseph Hunt. Um I would always ways put email Joseph Hunt or call Joseph Hunt. Um, because, uh, the next step of this is I'm gonna not today, I'm gonna show you how to segment your emails from your calls. So then you can really rip things out. It's like, ok, I have 10 calls I need to make. Here's just people that I've said are gonna get calls. Um If that's how you want to operate, um, you can do that too. Um, ok, let's X out of that. Don't save it and stop sharing your screen. Get my. There it goes. Ok. So if I send you all the video on how to create a task like uh Ashley just did. Um II I, the homework will be is create some tasks. Um And let's see how, see how that goes. Let me go back to projects here. It's 347. Um We had it enrolled. Ok. Oh, templates. All right, let's let's do that. Ok? You know what I need Ashley, share your screen again and go to Gmail. This is one I can't demo for you because I don't have a sale seat and Dan can't either. Um So uh you want X out of your task view? The X is on the right hand side. Yeah. Now go to your Gmail within, within here or like my actual gmail. I'm gonna show you two ways. Um And I won't look at your emails. That's fine. Uh OK. Go to compose because that's all I need to see. Um All right. So let's send an email to David at bridge rev uh subject line test to. OK. Now hover over uh uh templates. There you go. And you've got three templates. Those are the recently used. Um One of those has a phone number in it. Can you scroll down the sample and we should be able to see this one. Does template two. All right, let's choose that one. So here's your work around. Hey, at least I'm not asking you to type all this. OK? So it pulled in her phone number, right? But you're just gonna have to cursor there and put ext 0.484 but I at least saved you 10 minutes on the email. Yeah. Um So that's better than nothing. Um I do want us to make sure that this link is going where you intended it to it's, it's really the login screen. Is that, so can you click on the link and Dan verify? Is that really, is that where you wanted people to go to? That's what was in the, in your um, I assume it is because I would guess that you all, when you're talking to people, you're gonna tell them, hey, we're gonna send you to our enrollment portal. If you don't have an account you're gonna need to account. Ok, then we're good. Ok. All right. Um Ashley, go back to your Gmail and everybody. I mean, this is pretty simple as far as these templates. Um You can also uh at least in Gmail if there's some wording. I mean, I don't know how much leeway this is really uh Dan and Wilhelmina's um purview and call, but you can save what you've um created in gmail as a, as a template in gmail too. Um You just have to access it differently. Um Yes sir. Question. Are these in Spanish as well? What are they in Spanish? Do you have them translated into Spanish as well? Ok. I was gonna ask that I can, I can translate in and send them to you or Tomkin. So if we could have that, it will be 1000% easier on us, translate it, get it to Dan, he'll send it to me and I will uh get it in here. It'll say template um uh heritage. I'll just use the same numbers like follow up uh those kinds of things. But I mean, yeah, it could be the same thing just in Spanish. Yeah, we can do that also. I've never done this but Ashley, I want you to click tasks in that little menu bar in the blue. Look out. So if you just wanted to stay in Gmail, you can stay in Gmail. Um Yeah, you can do that. All right. Now go back to actually go back to your hub spot and I want you to search for the Well, oh you're kinda cutting out. Can you say that one more time? The search is in the top? Sorry. Uh huh Yeah. Search for David Welch. David Welch. Search for David Welch. There you go. Um That's not you. That's not me. Uh search for. There you go. That'll work contacts David, do I? OK? No, not David. Dum, bro. That's not me. Go back uh Here. Do it again, David. There you go. Oh That, that right there. Yeah. OK. OK. Sorry, that's me. All right. Now I want you to go to emails in the middle, create an email templates um owner. All of you will have to adjust this. Um It's uh it's an just go to any click there. Now let's do template two. Follow up. Same one we looked at you'll just need to click in and add your extension. Um Yeah. Mm and II I see a problem with this one. Can I ask that you guys stay in Gmail until I tell bart differently? Um You guys probably aren't spotting what I'm seeing. It's ok. Uh But let me um uh I uh it's not pulling in the contact's first name at the top um And it's in the template, so I'm gonna have to get support to um figure that out. It makes no sense. Um Go ahead and send that, go ahead and send that to me. Um uh hit send, OK? In the signature, I didn't see uh Ashley's uh position either, is that something that uh was taken out or? Uh no, it's because it's down here in our next project item to uh uh to populate. And I think I'm gonna have to give you a video on that um to populate your supervisor information and, and that kind of stuff. So um yes, stay in gmail another day. Um I'm going to make you a video on how to populate the rest of your signature um because we had to create some custom stuff for you guys um to do that. And I will also check that template. You can start using tasks um create tasks, update your call outcomes if you haven't. Um Let me see here. Uh Ashley, can you stop sharing? Mhm And taste and how to, how to upload uh templates? That's something that we need to do separately. I take it uh like how to create a template how to upload the templates ourselves, the, the stuff that you're doing right now. Um Let me, we'll have to do everything independently. So how, how will we do that? Are you at? Are we at that point where you uh I mean, not at that point yet, but we, we for sure need to understand, you know what you do. Yeah, you all do. I was telling Dan at some point I won't be here so teach how to create templates. Ok? Some time before June 1st. Um ok, start using templates in gmail only not hubspot just yet. Um And let me sport missing first um contact first name. I need to fix that. Ok? I'm gonna send you a video on how to do this because we're running out of time. Um but it's ok because you're not gonna send out emails via hubspot in the next 24 hours. So um we'll make sure and get that uh done in the next 24 hours and then um uh something with just Bart and Wilhelmina is we're going to send out an email to 5000 people. Um It might get you some, some inquiries. It may not. We'll see. Um You mean Dan, right Dan. And I did. Yeah, but the email the email is from Bart is how I uh it's Bart's email. Yes, I will talk to Dan and will mean about that. Yeah. All right. What's your primary takeaway today? Start using tasks. Yeah. Yes, that's for sure. All the options. I hope you missed something. But on the templates, are those already on there or like from my email when I go to templates? Um, is that something that Ashley made up and already had set up on there or is there, is it automatic Lindsay, share your screen? She's like crap. I asked a question. No. Yeah. Sure. Screen. Right. All right. I didn't judge your email so don't judge mine. Ok. Ok. Hm. Ok. So we come down here in the email and then click templates one second. Is anyone else seeing her screen? There we go. Um ok. Yeah, you're at Gmail. Yes. Uh click templates. Um No. Ok. What you see when you click templates so I can go and create that but I don't know you shouldn't have to. Can you do me a favor and click off that box again and go real slow and click templates and let me see your cursor hitting the ok, Duke. All right. Um That means that I must have not made the templates available to. I need to check to make sure because I was testing as Ashley. I wonder if that's what happened. But does anyone else can every anyone else um check their Gmail and um click templates and see if anything I have access to all of them. Yeah, I do too. This is Yeah, Tom, you uh Carla. How about you guys? I don't Uh, Dan, you would not, you would not Tom, do you, you do? Ok. Um, ok, Lindsay. Lindsay, I need to sleuth while you're not. So, um, I, I can do that. Let me put that in my project. Carla doesn't have a seat yet so we have to still, uh, get that established for her. Carla. What, Carla doesn't have a seat yet? Oh, ok. Yeah. So that will be established in the next few weeks. Ok. Well, Carla, we need to get you a seat. Um, were, were you guys still working with, uh, hubspot on? Um, actually, I can look and see. I don't want to pull that up in front of you guys. That's your account information. And, ok, it looks like you were still working through, then you're adding a seat. Dan. Yeah, we're, we're in contract negotiations for the next fiscal year. So that's ok, Carla, they'll let you know. Ok, I have a question. Um, ok, so, uh, my contact Miss Jones last week, she did sign up her four students but she accidentally signed them up for this year. So today we met at lunch time and I just put this in my task that we had to withdraw her students and then we're reenroll in them. My question is because this contact was not generated through our lead system. Uh, where would I, who would you recommend that? I put the names of those students? Ok. The names of the students um, well, let's first find, let's first get you a contact first. Is it any, what's, what's Miss jones' first name? Sherry Jones? Ok. Right here. Sherry Jones. Ok. So she's in hubspot? Ok. Ok. So, did you then, um, add her manually? I did. Congratulations. That's added manually. Ok. That's good. So, your question is, is where would you put the names of the students? I just went ahead and go ahead. I'm sorry. II I have never, I, I don't, I, we're gonna have staff, Dan and Willena or the rest of the group. Are you even collecting names of students? And if in a question and if so where are you putting them? Are you all listing the names of students as you're enrolling them? I've just been trying to put it in the notes because I didn't know if there was a specific spot under the contact section, but that's the only the, you know, the caregivers are, are listed. Uh But as this is already a student um and it's not on the, on the warm or hotly uh list, maybe we need to create a separate list for uh um re involvement that goes to us because I'm sure that will happen more frequent in the, in the near future. Well, you do have, so we did, I apparently we did plan for this Carla um see about this contact if you come down here, student, first name, student, last name. Now, if there's multiple students, there's multiple students, uh probably just in a note. OK? Because the thing is, is you only want to put these in properties. If we're trying to query against a property or find something, um, in, in, in your database, your student names don't necessarily matter. Um, in this database speaking correctly. Dan, that the student names really don't, you're not gonna do anything with those because we're contacting the caregiver. That's right. So the caregiver would be the trigger that would activate the list or whatever, how we're keeping it with data and information because the caregiver has the names all underneath. OK? I got it. OK? So I'll just put it in the notes because it really kinda from what I'm guessing won't really matter until the enrollment process. Um I'm guessing that's, and then it looks like uh Carl, I have a question. I like how, so you're using, um you're using like everything uh open deal and progress. That's good. Um What does open deal mean to you? I absolutely love this. Let me tell you. Um It just means I'm still working on it for me. That's what that means. Uh I love the timeline. You can click on that timeline, you can see everything you've done. I mean, this is just amazing. I really like it. I like it good. All right. Our time is up. I've got my homework, you've got your homework. I have a video to make you um I'm going to, I need to get with support on the that template. So you can be using in, in hubspot the video, I'm gonna make, you will help you finish out your E cigs. Um And then with that template fixed and then also with uh Lindsay, I'm gonna figure out why you don't have access to templates. Um uh We'll see because I don't know anything else. I think this is just for the future when, uh, um, power school is connected to a hubspot. Um, would it be easy then to, to, um, create reports, uh, that we have percentages, uh, of enrollments per, um, per list or is that something that's hard? Um, it can be done. I think what you're asking is, are you asking how many students got enrolled from a particular list? Exactly. Yes. Yeah. Uh, we can actually, um, but that's for, for the future when everything is working correctly, obviously. But that would be great. You can start. Yeah. And you can kind of start doing that now even just manually as far as, um, uh, yeah, but the, the, the number of enrollments are not, um, 100% right at this point, we still have to check certain things. So we just have to wait till everything is, everything is accurate. But that would be really great. Yeah. So we can run weekly reports to see what the percentage is conversion rate they call it. Huh? There it is. Um ok, I think I know what you're, you're trying to get to is we want a percentage and not just a number. Um, in a way it's uh kind of built off of the same logic as this. Um uh Yeah, so we just need a starting number and math. So the, the numbers that are listed here are all correct. They are correct in as much as the system has been. If people, if they're marked customer dash enrolled, that's what this is reflecting. Now, whether or not that record is customer dash enrolled. There's the human element. So I can't, I can't vouch that it, that it's correct. Um That part of it on, you know, is dependent on you guys. Awesome, Kelly, by the way, Kelly's on a roll, Kelly's on a roll. I spoke to Dan earlier. I think a few of those I did go back and change because I have been having a little bit of trouble with the power school. So that why? So after we do the next um training, I think what I'd like to do is a, um, what we call office hours. Um And you basically just bring your questions. Um And then that way you will also show me like maybe what we haven't covered. Well, we might see some patterns but um, so be thinking of, of that. That'll be, it'll what is today Wednesday? Um Let's shoot for that on uh I'll Well, Friday, um uh for office hours and we'll just do it for 30 minutes and, and not an hour. But then that way, um I won't have an agenda. Uh And you guys can just shoot questions or troubleshooting or, or that kind of thing. Um And then we'll, uh and then I'll train on the next batch of what gets configured. David. I just also wanted to say that according to these KP I management dashboard, um it's very important to emphasize that the data is, is entered into hubspot because that is what's generating these reports. And if you don't put the data in, then it's not gonna reflect very well on you. So we need you, we need you to put, do those tasks. We, we needed you to, to uh put in all the data that, you know, you're getting from this training and the previous training because if that data is not input, then it's not gonna reflect uh whether or not, you know, the, whether or not you're, you're, you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. So um this is the only way we can, you know, monitor. So we, we need, it's, it's so important that you um input that data uh because if you don't, then it's gonna show that you didn't and then it's not gonna reflect very well. So I just want to reemphasize that and it's just clear for everybody how to do that right at this point. Yeah, this is all call outcomes. Well, I, sorry, I can't answer that. The team has to answer that. Sorry. No, I'm, I'm, I'm referring to that other list where, where there were no tasks. Yeah. The tasks, um, shallow and, uh, and tom, the test completed. Oh, it just means he, um, Tom, an easy way to do that is when you're logging anything, check the check box. I wasn't creating as many tests but, I mean, I did create a few. Um which is why it probably shows such a little number. But yeah, I've been, I've been creating some. Ok. So you know how to. Ok, perfect. Yeah, because I think right now we're not, no one's getting judged on these numbers. Yeah, we wanna make sure that you know how to use it. So then when we reset this to um, it'll be like this week, then again everybody start from scratch. Um And then you will know how you're doing. Ok. All right. I will send the link uh to this recording uh to Mr Dan here in a few minutes once it renders and is ready. Ok. Well, thank you for your time and for the explanation. Um I, I take it that um, I always, I always like to look really far away so, um far ahead, I guess, but um when things are being transferred, you're going to give us all those um those awesome videos about how to do what? Right. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. That's all I had. Ok. The great thing is technically you all have me until July 7th, right? Yeah, that's a good thing. This was enough for you, but for us, it is. I was sharing with Dan that uh I, I kind of welcomed this. This has gone a lot faster than because we usually take the full 90 days and it's because we are juggling about 70 clients. But I wanted to see is it possible to go faster? It, it always is, always is. And so you all helped me as well have an experiment to where um instead of us trying to cover every single thing in the world, which is what we do most of the time is just go, how do you need to use it? Let's set that up and then, you know, train on it um and use it, get feedback from users. Um and then move on. Yeah, we're blessed with a very smart team. So it goes fast. Yeah, that, that's awesome. Thank you so much. See you. Bye bye bye Dan. We'll talk again in the morning. OK. OK.

All right, so good morning. Um, we are in our final kind of one of these in this format because we are switching around and um I appreciate those of you who have come to these. I know that it is um another just aspect of your time that you have to work in to come to me. So I appreciate that. And um I know that um we've tried to make them, you know, as relevant to what's going on like during this particular moment of the season of epic. So, but today's Power School and school training, we're gonna go over power school grade, book review, finalizing high school grades, elementary and middle school progress reports, elective portfolios, custom reports and power teacher pro custom report links and power schools and some resources. All right. So we're first gonna talk about just a, a grade book review, a few things about grade book. One thing that we want that just, you know, is good to keep in mind as we wrap up this semester. And the end of quarter two is that you wanna make sure grade books are an accurate reflection of their work and performance. Ok. Checking for accuracy. A couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, core curriculum, grades check to make sure the students score grades are passing back and be sure that you're looking at the Y one view, empower teacher pro to see all of the grades together, that's gonna show your grade pass back and that's gonna show your, your grade 200 too. Um, I'm actually, I'm gonna go back to the screen for just a second. I, I had someone ask me this this week so I wanna make sure that everybody sees this and to the left of all of all the grades, there's like a little, you know, tag or label and, um, that is one way to kind of quickly glance through and see if you're seeing grades pass that because they're gonna be labeled a little differently. These particular ones are play do, so you see they have the play doh label there. All right. Some other things to ask yourself when checking your grades. Um, do they match, first of all, should they match if you've added manual assignments into your grade book, then the final grade is not gonna match what the curriculum grade shows because those are gonna be, you know, average together. So those are gonna be a little different. Um, if you need to change the final, um, calculated grade in Power Teacher Pro because you, you know, you have other grades that need to be um added in something to keep in mind. Um Is that Plato is still pulling the pre-test grades into the grade calculation and power teacher pro. So to fix this, you can adjust the in the grade book. Power Teacher pro for each class or student to match what is inflated, this kind of walks you through how to do that. So once you're in the class, you wanna make sure once again that you're in the y one view and that's in the upper right corner of the power teacher pro grade book looks like this. Go to the score sheet for each class and click on the final grade, change it to the correct percentage grade and the correct letter grade and click state notice the comment filled with left blank, ok? Um It will save overnight and it so it doesn't immediately um change across the board. It does take, you know, it's an overnight, it's an overnight delay uh of that. So keep that in mind. So whenever you're pulling up on reports, things like that, it's not gonna change immediately. Ok? This side gets your attention because it is um really, really important that you know that if you manually change a calculated grade in the power teacher pro grade book, it will stop calculating going forward. There is a video which I'm not gonna play it right now. Uh Cassie, I don't feel the need to play it to you I think this is like an if, if you have this going on because you're gonna have access to this resource. So go ahead and watch it. If you need, you know, if you have this going on, it's gonna show you how to correct your grade book. If you've changed a calculated grade in the grade book, it's gonna, it's not gonna calculate after that. So you're gonna want to watch this video. Now that is um that is not if you put in a grade, that kind of thing. This is if you change a grade that's already been calculated within the grade book. So like an example would be um is, is this for overall grade two Cassie, I looked through this is the only um it really, you guys are really only gonna want to do it for Plato probably just because it's so drastically different. Um And we did ask about in this training like is this a you can do this? Is this the best practice? Is this a, this is a four year play, do classes they want you to change that calculated grade because any reports only do it for your high schoolers right now is what I would say. Um any reports are going to show really incorrectly. So any reports that they send to another school, anything like that are gonna show completely off because of the way it's pulling Plato pretests. And so for your Plato students, you're gonna wanna go in and just change that calculated grade in the power teacher pro even though you do still get to have the autonomy when you verify and finalize a grade. So they just want them change. So, but don't change it until they're like done because then it's not gonna calculate anything else. That's a good point. Yeah. So you want to calculate as much as, you know, it can to do that work for you. So wait till the very, very last, you know, when they're done, when they're, you know, they're not gonna have any other assignments that need to be passed back. Mm. All right. Supplement grades. So, think about what supplements the students are using and make sure you're giving them credit for that. Um, have all supplement grades been manually graded and added to the student's grade book? So you'll see here, like I was talking about these labels. Um, you're looking here, you've got these daily grades, summative grades. So just, just keep in mind if you've got, if you've got supplements, make sure your students are getting credit for the work they're doing in that and you do have to enter supplement grades manually. So, yeah. All right. For students who are not in Epic Ed, have you entered their formative grades? Be sure that you do not enter a date for those assignments to avoid triggering attendance twice because when they did the formative assessment triggered the attendance in that manner. So you don't wanna give them double attendance for that one assignment that they did? Ok. Other things to consider. Do you have documentation of all your offline work? And have you followed all of your principal guidelines and expectations for entering weekly work into your power teacher pro grade book? So just kind of think back through review, what your principal asked of you for your grade book. If there's specific directives, just just this is the time to go through and check to make sure that um those have been taken care of. I don't know what slide number I'm on. So I don't know if I've gone over my allotted moments of of good. Ok. Um So elective portfolios, have you added their elective portfolio to and have you manually added their assignments and grades into their power teacher pro class? Um So this is something that has to be done manually. This is not passing back. Ok? Verify the portfolios put together correctly once the student is finished and you as a teacher are going to provide the principal with the information, the principal reviews the portfolio and then the grade is finalized. So the principal does have to be involved in this process for finalizing portfolio grades. Ok. All right. Before you finalize a high school semester, one grade, make sure that you are diligent in ensuring that the grade you award corresponds with the mastery level, the student has demonstrated all semester one high school classes must be finalized and verified with the grade earned like ABC D or F or incomplete by January 13th. And there won't be any exceptions to that because, uh, we have to have all of our, all of our course information up to date and, um, to be able to be reported, you know, as a, as a course credit the last day, the students can work in a semester. One class is January 6th and that's the high school. I mean, we're, we're specifically, you know, we're talking about high school here because you're not gonna be finalizing um middle school, elementary school grades, but the January 6th is the last day they can work and any work completed after January 6th will be counted towards semester two. Ok. Be on the lookout for an addendum to finalizing high school uh semester one, high school grades ELC for additional clarification. And there is another resource here that kind of walks you through it. I'm gonna click on this, see if it pops up correctly on my screen for sharing. Let me know if it does not everybody see that. Ok, so I'm not gonna walk through this and talk through this with you guys because there is a lot of information, but it's a very good resource with really good screenshots showing you exactly how to do all of this. So make sure that whenever you get this resource that are on this slide, um make sure that you, you use this resource down here the bottom. It's a really good one. I know some of you already have it. Ok. And another one more thing, teachers should not finalize or verify an incomplete or a failing grade until after January 6th. So if you have a student that is going to be receiving an I or an F, you cannot finalize those until January after January 6th because that's the end of the semester. They have to have the full semester to be able to attempt to, you know, get that grade up or, or get that course done. All right, I'm gonna turn it over to Cassie and you got it muted you again. Then the tricky this morning, I love it. I love it. Sorry. Um All right, moving into elementary and middle school. So for high school, you are finalizing all high school courses, whether they finish them or not, you will finalize them with something. If it's an F or an I, those cannot be finalized until after the six because we wanna make sure we give our students every opportunity until what, like 12 am January 7th, right? So 1159 January 6th, they have until that point to do any sort of work for you in those classes. So if you have students that are done whatever and you want to finalize those before we had to break it. Like after this week, do it, go ahead if they are not complete or you are doing um or you are considering giving them an f um then you need to wait until you come back and after the sixth to do that. Um As far as I's and F's conversations, those are all principal conversations. Um they will have directives for you and conversations with you about, you know, your wise for each of those decisions. Um But for elementary and middle school, we're not finalizing, they are full year courses, we will not finalize them until the end of the year. Um So we will only do um progress reports if you have by chance finalized a um elementary or middle school grade. Um Let us know or actually let your principal know because they're gonna have to go in and, and take it out. Um All right, go ahead Prill. So this next slide Plato as you can see has been a little bit tricky for our power school s system. Um It's a great curriculum. Students love it. I had somebody ask about the pretests. Um Do not take those out. Those are great motivation for students. They're great for you guys to see what they know. Um It just when it pulls from Plato into our sy system, it doesn't see it and read it as though it's just some assignment that's not calculating into their overall percentage because in Plato, it doesn't calculate into it at all. But the Plato waiting doesn't transfer to Power School, which is why you have an overall grade assignment in Power School. Um but it is messing with the overall calculated grade, which is what parents see. It's what will show up on reports. So the stuff we're about to talk about doesn't really apply to plato um students because that progress report will be incorrect and we don't want to go in um like crystal showed with changing that calculated grade. You don't wanna do that for your elementary and middle students because it's just gonna mess it up for the rest of the semester. So anything that was talked about, about changing grades and all of that was really strictly semester, one high school. Um, so what we're gonna talk about is anything that's not play do right now, um for progress reports. So again, this does not apply to play do. Um, but we have two types of progress reports that we can run that you can show your students and or send to your families. Um, one of them is the progress report card with course teachers. Um, this is the one that you will want to use for um, this point in the school year because it doesn't give like a final grade because we don't have a final grade for them. Um, it shows their current percent complete and their letter grade for all courses. So like where they are, um and their letter grade. So it gives a pretty good amount of information, you can use it for your ninth through 12th graders, but you're finalizing a lot of those courses anyways, finalizing any s one courses. Um, and then there's a final report. So progress report card with a final grade column. So this one has a final column for stored grades. Um, this one you only use with high school students after you have been like after you finalize their grades. So if they want some sort of report, um, from you, like, maybe they're going back to brick and mortar and they said, hey, can I, can I have this, have a report or something? Um, just to have as I go in, I know the school is gonna send stuff whatever you can do this final report after you finalize their grades. Um, but progress reports for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna do the progress report card with course teachers. Um, and for your pre K through eighth, you'll wanna send those to your families. You can send them when we get back. You could, if your kids are kind of done and at that point, you can send them this week. It really is just kind of whatever, whatever feels right to you. Just as long as you're giving those families that information. Yes. So this is how you're going to run those progress and final grade reports. So you're gonna run these from the cyst, they're not done in Power teacher pro um, they're done in the cyst side. So to run these progress and final grade reports, um, if you guys wanna do it alongside us, that's great. You can, um, you go into the, um, log into your sis, um, you're gonna select reports on the left side of your home screen. So the place where you go to get, um, you know, any of the custom reports or any of that, um, in this cyst, you're going to click on reports, then you're going to choose, it'll pull up a box that looks like the second box. And in that first drop down, you're gonna choose progress report card with teachers. So this is actually gonna pull it up for your whole roster, ok? So this is gonna be a roster driven report, not student. Um I'll show you in a second how to do it with um students. So you're gonna choose the progress report card. Of course, the teachers hit submit and then view um and then it'll, it'll pull up the reports for all of your students. So if you wanna do it based on individual students, you'll just get to the student in the si so you'll go to whatever student you want. Um And then you guys have a I understand. Apparently Siri doesn't understand you today and then you will um click, click that drop down that allows you to select your screen. So you guys have lots of different screens. You can look at when you're looking at a student. Um there is a screen um drop down that says print a report, you'll do that, still select progress report card with course teachers submit and then view and that will give you just an individual student so you can do it both ways. Um Just whatever way is gonna make more sense to you. Um and be the best use of your time in order to run these reports. All right. So that was just your progress reports. We're gonna move into talking about custom reports and power teacher pro um I think this was something we talked about way early on in the summer. So this will be a little bit of a review. There's some videos um I don't know that we need to show them. Um What do you think? Crystal? We can but um so those of you who are are here right now just I'm, I'm trying to look at everybody if you feel like we need to watch this video together and we might, you know, need, need extra support in this area. If it's an overwhelming. Yes, we'll go through it. If not, I'm happy to get with you on a 1 to 1 basis if you have something. So do you guys feel the need to go through this together right now? OK. And this, this is available to you. So that, that's the whole idea that this is a usable resource. So for Sure. So we, we keep all of these in our a team training and resources um school class. So that's where all of these are housed. Um This one is just a quick tutorial walkthrough of how to just run like a roster report. Like what's going on with your students can, there's lots of different choices that you can choose when you're running a report in Power teacher pro so this one gives you a basic report. Um This next one, sorry for some reason, it will not advance. I've been trying to get it to advance for, but I think it wants me to. Can you like, hm, there we go. Now, sorry about that. So this tells you like once you've run the report, this is gonna talk to you about how to like export it so you can pull it out and put it into like a Google spreadsheet. Um If that's information that you need or if you want to have it all in one place, um This will show you how to do that as well. It's just moving very slowly this morning. There we go. Ok. So now once you run reports in Power Teacher Pro and you're like, ok, I've run like three reports and now I can't find any of them. Um you go to the little, your little bell icon um and there's a report queue. Um once you click on that, then there's an option for report queue and everything is held in there. Um, once your reports ready, you'll get a little notification on that bill as well. Um So, you know, hey, I have this report that's ready to view. So if you run any sort of report in Power Teacher Pro, it's gonna show up in that little Bell area. So, you know, where you can go look at it. All right. So that's Power Teacher Pro. We have custom reports in the s as well. A lot of these, you guys are very familiar with. We're just gonna do a brief rundown to make sure you um you know that they're there and you're using them. Um I will say as um you know, it's been, I'm two years out of the game now from teaching and I'm low key jealous that you guys have access to some of these reports because um there were reports that we had to wait for, we had to, our principal had to pull from five other places to get them to us. And so the fact that you guys have these at your fingertips all the time um is phenomenal and just the ability for you to have something in one place and be able to keep track of it um really easily that the school is running these reports at your level too. Um is just really, really great. So there's lots of different reports. There's actually one more um in your custom report links that is not in this picture that I'll also talk about. Um So you guys should be very familiar with your I A attendance summary report that is gonna be, um, that's the one that shows you how your students are doing as far as attendance and truancy and all of that goes. Um, if you're not familiar with that report, uh, get with us because you need to be and we will, um, we'll be sure to make sure that, um, it is stop showing any of your students out this week. All right, go ahead and put a ticket for that in Katie and we'll, we'll look at that because it shouldn't do that. Um, so that will, um, the I A attendance report just shows those instructional activities. Um, the quarterly IAS gives you an overview by quarter. So, you know, where they're sitting as far as hitting, you know, whatever their required activities are, um, incomplete. I LP S, um, if you've had new students come on or whatever, that's gonna give you a quick glance of any I LP S on your roster that aren't completed, um, grade book grades. Um, this page is where you're gonna finalize grades. So if you were looking to finalize grades for high school, you're gonna go to that grade, book grades page if you were here last year. Um, that grade book grades page was like where you looked for all sorts of things, you had to look for check marks and you didn't want any weird um error images on, on the left side, those that is not really um applicable this year. So that's something that I know. Um several teachers were like, well, there's not green check marks. Why is it red? Why is it yellow? Like we, because last year we had, we stressed that, but last year you guys are responsible for putting in every single grade with the way pass back is working. You're really not gonna see green check marks a lot of the time unless you're looking at like year one or semester two. for a lot of those grades, especially with high school since it passes back into semester two, technically for that pass back. So really, I've, I've talked to Carolyn and um, she said we're not paying attention to the icons this year. Just we wanna make sure the grades are in there in power teacher pro you can see them in IAS and then you can finalize um the I cap one. So tutoring fidelity is great. We actually asked for that one for you guys because the admin side had something like that. Do they do they have that one? Because this one, this is our admin view. Do you know Crystal? He mentioned that they should be able to do it. I was gonna say, I know we fought for you guys to have that because we had a, we had a picture of that So, um the tutoring fidelity gives you a good picture of where your students are as far as et I requirements. It will really only um it will show you all students, I think, but it will really pinpoint those kiddos that were like required to do, et I as far as the school's metrics. Um So that keep that in mind when it's tracking some of that if you have a student that wasn't required by the school metrics, but you're requiring it for any reason, then just know that it may not pull their as accurately. Maybe. Um a of course, that's gonna show you um your submissions whether it's approved. So that's a place where you can go to quick glance like what students do I have left, what students do I need to do. Do I need to um redo any? I'm not 100% sure if that one shows you if they like kicked it back. Um I think that's something that you'll, you might have to get from your principal. I feel like that's part of a spreadsheet that the A team has running, but I do know that this will show you if it's been submitted and approved. Um I don't believe, I guess if it says no on approval, then you can always go back and check with your principal and say, hey, do you know what's going on with this or do I just need to wait? Um You guys also have one more um, custom report that is in your custom report links right now and it is your benchmark completion. I was so thrilled for you guys to have that at your fingertips. Um The benchmark completion one shows you all of your students, whether they're complete with their benchmarks, it'll show you what benchmarks they have completed. Um You can also do a comparison over like if you do it from today, you can compare it to last week. Um Just lots of really great information at your fingertips there to, to check for accuracy to see if anything's wrong with reporting. Um and also just to show yourself, hey, I, I need, you know, maybe I missed this kid or maybe something didn't submit, right? Or, or whatever. Um Just be very cognizant that all of these reports. I know you guys are used to like the I A attendance summary and how it updates, right? It runs about 24 to 36 ish hours behind, right? Um So all of these reports run in the same way. So if you're looking at benchmark today, if you pull up the benchmark completion report today, it's really gonna be accurate for what's today, today's Thursday. It's gonna be accurate for a full day through Tuesday. So it's not gonna show anything from yesterday. So anything that was updated yesterday was updated for Tuesday. So after it runs tonight and you look at it tomorrow, it's gonna show anything you did from Wednesday before. So, keep that in mind, um, before you're like, ah, it's not right. This report's not right. If you did something yesterday it's not gonna show on there. Um, just like your I, a attendance summary does. Um, so just be really cognizant of that. It has to say all of these have times of when things are run, when reports are run, all of that. So you can kind of know where it's at for accuracy, but please make use of this. You guys, this really puts a lot of power in your hands to know um where you are and to be able to, to be able to just really get students engaged um to really be able to um just take ownership of all the things and, and you can look at it and you're not waiting on anybody for information. Um You can have all of it and, and be proactive at, you know, getting students engaged, getting things done clearing your plates, all of that. So I'm excited that you guys have this information. If you have problems with any of those, feel free to reach out to Crystal and I, and we'll, we'll be sure to help um resources. Um So there's all sorts of resources here that talk about attendance grades pass back home room. Our Epic Ed Fa Qs. A lot of these things are things that we've kind of compiled as we've gone. Um through answering tickets or gone through just, just different things with you guys as we've, uh, we've troubleshooted and as we've seen a need for something to have kind of at your fingertips, um, they're all right here. So if, if you're looking for them, they'll be here in this, in this, um, powerpoint for you and you can click and look at them to your heart's content. Um, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. We really wanted to um hit on finalizing grades and progress supports as we know that that's coming. Um, a lot of you are probably doing a lot of that today and tomorrow as we get into break. Um, and it will definitely be um, home stretch for that when we come back. Um, just know that that deadline for grades, absolute deadline for grades is the 13th. I think that um, not speaking for anybody, but I know that every, everyone on our team is a clear your plate, get it done type of person. All of our principles are. And so, um, don't wait man, get that off your plates and let's move on and, and keep going. So if you have questions about any of that, if you need help with any of that, about the processes, I will know, I will tell you with grades, um, processes and how Tos Crystal. And I are happy to help. If it's a can I, can I give this grade. Can I do that grade. That is 100% um a question you need to bring to your principal because that is not, that is not in our wheelhouse. So um just kind of know that we wanna make sure that we aren't telling you anything wrong. Um because we are not, we are not your bosses, we're your helpers. So um oh, I was gonna mention it was mentioned to me in the chat. Um This is not something I'm overly familiar with, but I will mention this and if you have something like this going on, um I, I can, I can definitely dig into this further for you. But um I if you have gone in, I I guess some teachers have changed their waiting in bright thinker, not, not within power school or whatever, but within the bright thinker platform you've gone in and if you've gone in and changed your waiting in that those changes are not being reflected in power school. So if that is the case and you're having problems with, you know, the grades looking different if it's coming from bright thinker and you change the waiting, that's likely why. So that that would end up being something you would probably need to adjust whenever it comes down to like the final grade. Um like I'm not familiar with any other process with that, but that was mentioned and so I was gonna bring that up in case anybody else is having that issue Um And you know, Katie, you said your I report stopped showing any of your students. Um I don't know if you saw Jill's comment in that in there that uh you have to click the submit to view and then they will load. So I guess it's just maybe something weird that's going on in that. Thank you for that. It's always nice when you guys can troubleshoot together. Oh, and Katie said that fixed it good. All right. Um That, that is all of this training for today. Uh Audra, if you have a moment to stay on, I can look at that with you. The problem we talked about yesterday. I think I may know one thing that might be going on kind of a weird little deal there. But um if you don't have time right now, that's fine too. I'm good. I don't have class till 930 so we're good. Ok. Ok. It'll be quick. Um And that's, that's really it. You guys thank you again for being here today. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas break. I hope that um you come back feeling refreshed and please reach out if you need anything. We're happy to support you. Yes. Merry Christmas. Everybody holler if you need us. Hey, I've got a question. It's not really work related. I mean it is, but it's not. Um So I got a new cell phone number.

So Lita started the recording. I'm just gonna reexplain for those that are not here today. And my name is Megan. I'm a part of bright thinkers, professional development team. We're gonna be walking through the student's application as far as what they can submit, what they're able to see on their side, all of the different features within Epic. And then we'll also look at a teacher's end and everything that you have a accessible through Epic, you all have a specific role. And so especially if you are a returning teacher and you notice something or you have a question about something, please don't hesitate to take your microphone off or throw something in the chat and just let us know specific Epic things. Um And then of course, if you have any questions that are regarding Epic specific leader will be throughout the chat as well. Um So Lena mentioned that y'all have a spreadsheet that was shared with us, which is questions for bright thinker. Um And it looks like yes, I'm still sharing my screen so you're able to see it. And these are just a few of the questions that came in. So we're actually gonna walk through the demo first because it's just basics of what it looks like and then we'll come back to the questions. So if you have any, please throw those in the chat or for Sophia or Lita and then you can also add to that spreadsheet and I should get updates. Um, but if not, if you don't see your question updated, just let me know at the end. All righty. So this is what it looks like for anyone in bright thinker when they click log in. Um As a teacher, you might see a couple different permission sets, you should as an epic teacher have the option as an administrator or a teacher. Mine says student because I'm enrolled as a student. Um So we're gonna start on that side when you're in the course. I'm actually gonna change my color really quick. I like it at blue. It's less distracting for me. Um But I know y'all's color is orange. So when we start as a student logging into the platform in the top left hand corner, it will highlight that the student is on their courses tab, they also have the option to click over to the to do list and this will show them anything past due at the beginning and then the next seven calendar days due from there. And I just wanted to remind as well as we're walking through here. Please do not hesitate to take off your microphone or talk in the chat and ask any questions as we're moving along in the platform. So these are all quick links for those students. They can click right into here and actually access that lesson. You'll notice that it's not showing the lesson for the student just because there's an activity due before this one and this one is just the getting started video. So we'll talk a little bit more into that in depth, but I'm gonna stay on the to do list for now. So these are all quick links. The student can work right from here. It will tell them the due date and most of the courses in epic are continuous courses, which means that the course will automatically pace out for the students giving them targeted due dates. So they're not hard set dates. These are just going to pace out depending when the student needs to end the course. By the last thing on the top, on these tabs that the student can click on is their activity stream. This is going to be a notification center for the students. So this is where they can come to see any feedback left by a teacher. If they have a new score updated, anything the student would need to be notified of as well. You can see click click links here. So any time you see a blue hyperlink as a student, you can click right in there and it'll either give you the feedback for the new score you earned. And then if I were to click on one of these titles that would bring me right into that lesson or quiz, I'm gonna click back over to my courses tab on the left hand side in order to navigate back to my courses. So this is exactly what it looks like, right? When they logged in, they'll always see the updated day and then the announcements to the right. So anytime a administrator at the top level, meaning lita or someone with an epic at a higher level has posted an announcement for everybody to see teachers and students. Or if you have as a teacher have posted an announcement, the student will be notified here and they'll be able to click and be able to see that announcement. It will notify them of who this came from. So my name in the site is Bright Thinker, but this would say the teacher's name who it was given to. So this is the course and then the date it was created and when it expires, you'll notice it automatically brought the student to the communication tab. This is something they can find in their hamburger menu in the top left hand corner. I'm gonna click back. We'll notice that it brought us right down to communication. I'm gonna click back into the home icon and how I got there was that announcements right from the home page. So speaking of that hamburger menu. We're actually gonna walk through there first. So I'm gonna click back up there in the top left hand corner and the first option down from the home icon is the grades for the student. So this is gonna be their overall grades. If they're enrolled in four courses, all four will populate here. They have that quick link to their course. They also have a heart icon. This allows the students to click and drag their understanding interest and effort levels to update their teacher on how they're feeling. And of course, there's four options within each bar and they can come in here and update this as much as they'd like. It will also list any teachers enrolled in the course and then they have two different progress bars when hovered over, it'll tell them the total number in each progress. This one has 43 on the right and this one has 37. The first one is just gradable activities. So anything included in the students final score, the other one is going to include any non gradable activities as well such as coloring pages, objectives, like getting started video, something that the student wouldn't require a grade for, but it's still an active activity they must mark as complete in order to finish the course. They can also view on the top left hand corner where it's highlighted as courses, any of their past courses. So I've been enrolled in quite a bit of past courses, but this is where I can come and see any scores. I previously earned my current status in that course. And then the progress and the time that I spent there, I click back over to the courses tab where the student would be and anytime they see this print icon, they have the ability to print this out. So it'll just give them that summary of the page that they're on. I'm gonna go back in the main menu and underneath here is the notes tab. So this is where students will hold such as a digital notebook. And any time they're in the lesson, they have an ability to take a permanent note where they can take notes on any of the content. They're learning to remind themselves of anything such as if they had a physical notebook in a in person class, just gives them the ability to come back here and have access to anything. They took notes while learning a lesson back in that main menu underneath the notes tab is the communication that's where we were brought earlier from the announcements notification. They can click through and see any announcements that has been posted by a teacher and or admin back in that main menu underneath the communication is gonna be the calendar again with those continuous courses, it will pace out for the student so they can come here and click anywhere they see the color coordinate dot with each course, anything due for that course, any blackout dates will also populate for the student and it will notify them that nothing is due on those days. So that's gonna be any holidays assessed by your administrators and already input into the main domain for you. But when the student is enrolled in multiple courses, they'll have different courses listed beneath with all of the different color dots for them. And these are also quick links. So if the student wanted to work right from their calendar, they could click right in here and begin working for the day. I'm gonna click back in the top left hand corner and down to student resources. This is the last option that a student has in their main menu. It's all of the frequently asked questions by students in the platform, especially if they're brand new to bright thinker all via video. But then at the very bottom, we also have a PDF option depending on the student's preference. Teachers and administrators also have this tab in their main menu. Should you need it? Um Just so you can help direct the students if they get a little lost in the platform. Lastly, underneath all of the main options, we then have a dark gray bar and all of the courses that the students enrolled in so that they can click right from here and begin working in their course. Should they want to from the main menu? I'm gonna use that home icon. And then that way we can look at what a course card is. So we call this rectangle of course card. It includes an image to coordinate with the course that the students enrolled in as well as the course title. And then these dates right here are gonna show unique to the student. The first and last day they can submit work in the course. Once they actually begin working, they'll have a current score populate here. And then the progress bar will actually also darken as they move along in the course. And then at the very bottom, we have a play button that will bring them right into the activities or the bar graph icon will bring them to their grades specific to this course. So we're gonna click on that play button and then the student will automatically see a few things here. So all of those same course details from the main page, but then to the right, they will be able to see their score right here once it populates, I haven't begun working. So I don't have one yet. The great icon again here. And then the eyeball feature allows the student to click and hide their score. So if they had a score previously right here, it'll just disappear as there's nothing there. It's not gonna change their grade in any way. It's actually just going to hide it from them if they're discouraged in any way or they just don't want to see their sport at this time. And then underneath they, they have a more in depth progress. So they're able to see by percentage and one hovered over the exact amount out of total that they have completed as far as activities in this course underneath, there is going to be the welcome page or the landing page. This is specific to each teacher. So once we switch over to the teacher, we'll show you how you can customize this. It's utilized in many different ways across the board. You can use this as a static announcement. You can include a Zoom link, any youtube videos, any text and images that you'd like to make unique to your course, just what you whatever you'd like the students to see as soon as they log into their course and then scrolling down, the student will then see the full entire course, all one through 10 units. If it's a core course under that activities page to the right. They have another quick snapshot of their to do list just for this course. And then they also have course links. These are all unique to this course as well. They can be included by the teacher as extra resources or anything you should want to show the student. When clicked on, it's just going to populate a new tab. We used our bright thinker site as an example. But again, you can use this for extra resources for math, reading anything you'd like, I'm gonna click back over to the activities and then the student can either start at the up next activity at the very top or they can open a unit folder and begin working at the first activity there. The getting started video is going to be in all of the courses for the student. It's just a quick walk through of the platform in case the student has never been a bright thinker before, they would click mark this activity as complete in the bottom left hand corner and then they would be able to move to the next activity by scrolling to the right hand side. Once here, this is actually going to show the next unit uh just a quick preview of what's coming up because we haven't yet begun working in this unit folder. So I'll click on that first activity. And in here, we've actually up included an upload example for fourth grade science. So this is a science journal activity requesting that the student create a cover page for their science journal and then a table of contents and all of the safety rules encompassing here. So as a student after I have finished my work, I have a couple different ways that I can upload in the platform. You can either click right into this text box and it will populate a ton of different options for the students. One being this picture icon that allows you to insert an image right from your device. So you can either click and drag an image right here. You can upload by URL or using this um camera icon. You can capture right from your device. If you have a webcam applicable, then the student also has the option to insert a video or audio. They can text right within the box, oops or they can use the plus button in the big blue circle in the bottom right hand corner allowing them to attach a file right from their device. So there's many different ways that the students can upload work. I'm gonna use your course list as an example and then I'll upload there. Once the student has uploaded, they can confirm before submitting their work that this is what they intended to upload. If they are not trying to submit this for their work, they clicked on the wrong activity, they can simply remove before they submit and select the correct image instead. But I like what I have. So I'm going to submit my work and then a few things will change for the student here. It's going to notify them. They have successfully submitted the assignment and the button now changes to resubmit my work into instead of submit. So is there a limit for the size of the file that they can upload? Um We, I would have to actually look into that. Lita let me take a note of that. We haven't run into any issues where students have tried to upload it too big of a file. Um I'm sure there is a limit but it's probably greater than anything a student would try to be submitting. That's a great question though. I'm gonna follow up on that just in case. All right. So that's how a student would submit work. And then if you scroll back just a little bit to the top, you can now see that the status has changed to completed slash submitted. And they'll see this little paper icon. Anytime a student sees this paper icon also in the top right hand corner in the platform, that means that there's either a portion of the activity or the entire activity requires something to be graded by the teacher. So they do not have the full grade yet. It's not an automatic submission by the platform. So they're waiting on a grade in here in order to move to the next activity, they can either use the toggle arrows in the top left hand corner or scroll to the bottom and use the next activity button in the bottom right hand corner from here. This is an example from first grade social studies. So it's gonna look a little bit different than those older grade levels for K through two, if we have any K through two teachers in here. Um This is just going to show you an overview how the difference the students have in that they'll learn just a little bit of the content and then answer those questions here instead of on the older grade levels, it's actually going to all encompass on one page and all of the content will be at the top and then they'll scroll to the bottom and review section in the bottom. So this was intended hopefully to hold that focus of the students as they're learning and cause less distractions instead of having it all on one page. And you will notice this is a good thing to take note of. Um these videos are not required to be watched. So if I was a student and I got to this last page and I decided I don't want to watch the video, I can click next um that they are able to watch that video if they would like none of the videos in Bright Finger are going to exceed three minutes. That is because they're intended to assist with learning but not teach the lessons themselves. So I'm gonna click next. Once the student hits this review page, they will see a check mark in the bottom right hand corner of each question, ensuring they have answered all of the questions, I'll click submit in the bottom right hand corner and then it'll give the student one last chance. So just make sure they don't wanna go back and check any questions before submitting, but I'm ok. So I'm gonna submit and then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, I automatically have earned a grade for this. That is because there was nothing open ended or essay, nothing to upload. So the teachers are not required to provide a grade before the student sees their answers or I'm sorry before they see their score. So if the student either can click jump to submission up here in the top left hand corner or they can scroll to the bottom of the page, it'll just bring them down here. There is a section called view grade details and this is where the student is able to see a quick snapshot of everything entitled in their course. So their score, the status is now completed, the targeted due date versus the date they submitted as well as the active amount of time they worked on that lesson before clicking submit. They can also then click over to the questions tab and the lower grade level students will have to click through in order to see their questions per number. Um But this is where they can come and see what they answered and the question score and you'll notice that this is actually exactly what an epic student sees um because I have changed all the settings to match. And so the student will see their answer and the score after the first submission, I'm gonna go back. They also have a submission history. It's just a quick snapshot for the student to be able to see if they submit again, then they'll see the second version here with the unique details of that second submission. So I'm gonna go back really quick since it's a first grade and resubmit my work so that you can see what happens after the second attempt. Um The students will always have this retake button available that to them for anything encompassing in the lessons category, which means lessons, activities, practice not included in the practice test, project skills and they have an unlimited number of attempts with epic. So they can click retake here in the bottom right hand corner and the activity will look as if this unit had never submitted. So they would go back through, provide a new answer or the same answer depending on their first round. And then oops, I missed a couple there. I think I skipped over number three. Yeah. All righty. And then once I click submit here, my new score will pop in the top right hand corner. So when I go down to my submission area and my view my grade details in the submission history, I can now see the 1st and 2nd version and the scores I earned the 1st and 2nd time. I'm gonna click back on the X air in the X in the top left hand corner. And then I'm gonna talk all to the next activity from here as the students are working in the platform. They also will have a couple different options to help assist as they're learning. So in the top right hand corner, you'll notice in the toolbar, we have a highlighter is the first option. Now, depending on which device you're on, it will allow you to either just drag over and that will highlight some devices require you to drag and click enter. Um So just be aware of that as students are working in the platform, the highlighter can be utilized in the content itself or in the review section. So this is a great example of how K through two is a little bit different than those older grade levels. This one came from an eighth grade course. So you'll notice how everything is on one page with the vocabulary at the top, the content itself and then the review section at the very bottom, they also have an eliminator to the right of the highlighter. This is going to give that visual process of elimination on multiple choice questions. So when hovering over, they'll see that little X and this will allow the student to visually cross out any answers, they are sure are wrong. The student accidentally clicks on one of the correct answers. No big deal at all. They can either just click that right back off or if they select that answer choice, it will take it off for them to the right of the answer eliminated. They will have the print feature. This is printing prior to submission. So they will be able to work on paper should they need to. Um but they would still be required to go back in and answer digitally on the platform to the right of the print feature. Then we have text to speech which will open up a full panel of options. So I'll go to the top so we can look at a couple of these options. You have the pointer finger which will allow the student to select where they would like the platform to begin reading. An assumption is a statement that is accepted. They also have the play button that will read from the very top of the um lesson itself and read up to 1000 words. They would then need to use the point your finger to continue. Should it exceed past those 1000 words past that we have the stop and pause button and then the translator. So this can do anything from a sentence to a word to a phrase to a paragraph. Um I'll just do one word here and then we can click the translator button up in the top right hand corner and this will translate the word for them. It looks like it's clicking on the wrong one. Let me try that again. So now let me check my settings really quick. Sorry about that. So mine's translating from English to Spanish. Let me try a fool. Freeze here. There we go. So it's gonna translate to the language specified in the settings which we'll get into in just a minute and it will read out for up to 18 of the most common languages. Some of them will only translate the text itself. I next to the translator is going to be a dictionary. So it will give a definition of a word or phrase highlighted. We then also have a picture icon to go along with all of the words in the platform. Next to that will be the screen mask, which is one of my personal favorites. This will allow the student to focus as they're reading through the platform. I used to do this with a bookmark on actual textbook. So it's nice to see this in a digital platform as well. And then last but not least we have the magnifier which coordinates with the pointer icon and will magnify the words as it reads to the students. Emotional appeals often use loaded language or last icon next to that is actually a highlighter. So very similar to the one that we have within the platform already. But this will actually give a couple different colors which is very useful in English or some of those higher level grade levels that need to annotate or use different colors. Um So you can just highlight over where you need to and click the color you'd like to use and then you'll notice the gear icon. This will allow you in the general settings to change the voice speed, the text highlighter color, the magnifier size as well as the speech mode. And then we have the translation button. This is where you can select which language it's translating from English to another language. And you'll notice this little um microphone or loud icon that just lets you know that it's actually going to speak that language to the student. Otherwise it will only translate the text to them. Then we also have screen tools. So if you'd like to change the reading light color, so this is just specifically for the reading mask, so I'll change it just so we can see what it looks like. And the student actually is able to open that screen mask and then change what it looks like. So they can decide actually that's not what I actually wanted there. Um And then they can do anything to their preference here and then should they not like anything, they can reset it back to the default. And we do have a PDF explaining everything that I just went through in detail. Should you need to share that with a student or go back and research your steps as you're walking through it on your own, any time you see the paper, airplane icon that's going to be communication form for the student. So as long as the teacher and the student both have an email within the platform, they will be able to send a message to this, the teacher keeping in mind this is going to go to every teacher enrolled in the platform. Um but they can ask a question right from here and it will send straight to the teacher's inbox of whatever email is specified in their profile last. But not least we have that notes icon, sticky note at the very top. Anytime you see it in the student tools that's gonna be a permanent note and it allows the student to take a note and it will save in that digital um notebook that we saw earlier in the notes tab of the main menu. So they can um either copy and paste into the platform of the notes or they can type right within here and then it'll time stamp it for them, tell them where it came from and then they can click right to their notes from here as well if they'd like to. But I'm gonna click through the questions at the bottom. Um Just so we can move on to the next activity and you can see what this looks like. If anybody has any questions, please feel free to take off your microphone or throw them in the chat. And Sophia will either answer them or let us know and we can talk through them as well. Can you delete um activities or lessons if you needed to? Absolutely. Sorry. Go ahead to modify for a student. Yes, absolutely. So we can go in a little bit in depth of it, specifically what Epic prefers as well. But once we get to the teacher's side, I'll show you the editor and you have freedom to hide activities. And so that will essentially excuse for all of the students that'll take it out of their preview. The only reason we recommend to not delete is just because especially if students had already begun working in the platform and it will delete all of the scores they previously earned. But that's a great question. All righty. So you all will notice um we had a few automatic grading options at the top of the activity. But then we also have some open end questions. We just wanted to put this in here so we can show you what it would look like for a student. So they will see that same icon indicating that something needs to be graded by a teacher and they will not be able to see a score until that is given by the teacher, but they can still see the review section. So everything they provided an answer for and then the text box at the very bottom um for the ones that had the and now last year lita I don't know if it's just on my side. I know you were asking a question but you were cutting out quite a bit. So I wasn't able to hear what it was. Yeah, there, there's some classes that have the guided notes, I can remember what they're called. Are they available this year or is that not till next year? Yes. So the accommodated courses are what you're referring to. I believe those are actually only going to have a reduced number of questions per ques quizzes practices and unit test. So they are available. Um Those are completely separate courses that would need to be added in. Um but they will be containing five questions across all quizzes and then 10 questions a across all practice and unit tests. Thank you, of course. All right. So at the sa the bottom, all those same options are gonna be here in order to view the grade details, see the targeted duty and when it was submitted and then they have that retake button available to them. I'm gonna click the next activity from here and this is actually going to be an example for once we get over to the teacher side. So I'm actually gonna skip this lesson and move on. I messed up. I forgot to allow myself to move on. So let me go ahead and submit this really quick and then I will be able to show you a quiz. All righty. So Epic does only allow two attempts per quiz for students. So it doesn't mean that the student can never take it past the two attempts. This is just prior to teacher intervention. So as a teacher, you'll always be able to go in and allow additional retries past those two attempts. But this is what the student will automatically receive. So when they click start, they will need to submit um require an answer per question and they will have to submit all at once. They don't have the ability to answer this question, leave and come back. Anytime a student leaves the assessment, they get kicked out via internet or issues or anything else that happens, the platform will. So let's say the student only answered this first question, the platform will submit for them, but it will never submit an answer for them. So it'll just all be marked blank. So they'll see the blank in the review section and then there'll be a um everything will be answered or marked as incorrect as far as the blank answers. So you'll be able to confirm, ok, there was probably an internet issue or they backed out of the quiz before they were done. The platform will never select an answer for the student. So I'll quickly go through and click so that you all can see the difference of what a student can see for the first admission versus the second. Um But as we'd asked earlier, there is something that we call an accommodated course offering this year. So it's brand new. Um And with those, all of the quizzes will only have five questions versus how you see here. This quiz has. I believe it's about 20 yeah, 20 questions So we're gonna click next. All of those are available. So I'm gonna click submit. So after I submit, there's no questions to display here. Um I got a 50% automatically and then I can view my grade details from here. I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. And then now everything that I have provided a submission for, I can see that green check mark indicating I've completed that activity, close that out and then this is just a full instructional unit so that you could see what it would look like outside of our examples. So this is third grade science unit two. It's gonna have about three lessons until it hits that first quiz. All of the activities, labs following pages will be sp sprinkled throughout the unit itself and then at the very bottom, they'll have a practice test and new unit test before they reach that next unit. Very similar. This is English one. Obviously, the grades are drastically different. Um But the flow of the course is about the same. So I'm gonna click back on my main menu in the top left hand corner. Now that I'm in a course, I have a different sub menu you'll notice. So I can click into my activities or grades from here because I'm already in this specific course. So the grades for each course, this is where a student can come see their overall score. There are different percentages for progress. And then if they scroll down to the bottom, they'll be able to see each line item submitted versus targeted due due date, the status and the score here. They also in the top left hand corner, have a dashboard, they can click on and then I'll just give a quick overview as well as the activity, which is a almost the far right, but about the middle and this will show the student exactly how long when they started working in each activity and then the total amount of time spent in this course, click back on that grades and then the main menu in the top left hand corner, they can either use these toggles, um icons in the top to navigate back to that regular menu or they can use that arrow to be able to see everything from here. So now that I took notes in that course, they populate here for me and I can actually click right back into the course I was working on. We use that main menu to go back to the student application. And then the last thing I'd like to show you on the student side is in the top right hand corner. The student's name will populate here again. Mine is just right thinker in the platform, they can click and get a couple of different options from here. Choose theme is gonna be the second one. This is where they can come and change their color theme. Now, of course, this can change at any time throughout the school year. If administrators at the top level of the domain decide they don't want students to do this, there's a couple of things they can turn on and off. Um But lady can correct me if I'm wrong. I believe the students currently have the ability to change the color and they also can choose their color scheme, meaning if they use the drop down option, they can change to a dark color scheme. So I'll do an obvious different color, like green and then the color will change everything such as their banners, their menu, anything that coordinates and then the dark color scheme have now changed everything that was once a light gray or a white color to a darker color. Um So this helps a lot with students that have headaches or issues with being on a computer for a long extended amount of time. Um But they definitely don't have to turn that on if they don't want to Megan walls just to show them how they share the calendar with their parents lito you're cutting out again for me how they view the calendar for their parents. Is that what you said? Well, I know that last year, the calendar Google calendar so their parents can see when things are due. Understood. Yes. So the students actually have the ability to go to their calendar. So I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner again down to the calendar icon and they will see these arrows in a circle and this allows them to sync and it will give them information on how to sync with their Google calendar. So it'll give all the due dates straight to their Google calendar. The only thing is they will not be able to click right from their Google calendar into the lesson. It doesn't um flow quite that well yet. Um But it will just show up the due dates in their Google calendar. So they're able to see it in both places. Um Teacher, I knew that this was really helpful. This would have been really helpful for my parents. I don't know what's due. I don't know when we was everybody able to hear lita on that one. No, I think you're sounds cutting out for everybody lita, but I was about to, I was able to piece it together. I think she was just intending that this is very useful for the students with Epic and the parents being able to see that calendar that the stu I guess, do the parents have access on their side to see their Google calendar maybe. And so it's a lot easier for them to be able to see that instead of having the students log in and showing them everywhere that everything's due. Yes. And you should be able to uh make that link of the calendar and the, that calendar in there. Um, as well. I lost little pieces, but I think I fully understand what you're saying. They're able to connect the calendars. So, yes, just that, those two arrows in a circle that allows them to see the options of how they'll sync those calendars. It's pretty easy. I've done it on my side. It gives you all the information right here and then they can connect those on their end. And then the last thing that I wanted to show you on the student application again where their name is in the top right hand corner, clicking down to see the first option is settings as a student. This will be all of the user details that were given to me once I was created as a user. But on the right hand side, I can put in any email or mobile number that I'd like with the coordinating carrier. So we see this a lot for parents and they can be notified of any of the following student notifications. So they would input their email and or mobile number, select their carrier and then come down here and they can choose either text or email depending on the notification. And then either daily or weekly of when the enrollment status changes, their grade drops below passing if they submitted an activity. Um someone replies to a discussion post. This is more in the high school level courses, not really in the younger grade. Levels. Um But if they're ever awarded a badge or they receive a score or feedback. So this is a great way to immediately connect with the parent's email and or number and just get notified of these few options here. And then the students also have the option to select from the avatar list. Should they want to pick an image for their profile and then they would just click save and refresh their browser to update anything that they had changed before we move on over to the teacher application? Did anybody have any questions of what we have covered or have not as far as the student application, you may have said this, but can they access um their activities from their calendar? Uh kind of like the to do list? Are they actually able to access from the calendar as well? Yes, absolutely. So if they select a day that actually has something to do with that color dot Anything they highlight over, they'll be able to click right in there and be able to work right from the calendar. And I will know um I don't have anything double due right now. But if they had multiple activities for one course, they would just have a little carrot button here and they would just click to expand and then they can click on each specific activity from there. OK. I have a, I have a question. Yes, ma'am. Um Is there like a standard or does it vary by grade level like this? Right. Thinker. Try to give students two activities a week per subject. Um, or does it just fluctuate depending on subject? And then, uh, the, the part where you showed where t where that you can sign up a parent's email address? J what's your, I'm sorry? Um, where you can set up the kid, the parents email address? Is that something that teachers can set up for them or would without having to log in through the parent portal? I mean, the student portal. Uh No, ma'am. So unfortunately, the notification settings will only be per user. So they would have to do that in their own settings per student. Um But they're very quick to access. So as soon as the student logs in, they can just click right from their name to the settings and then it's all right here for them. I was wondering if there was a way to lock that once you put in a email or a phone number. So the student couldn't go in and remove it. There's not. So it gives w freedom just for the ability. Should they put the wrong one in or they need to update it? It's there for them. Um But then back to your first question, Nadia, uh as far as pacing for the students, um can I ask which grade level you're teaching? Uh all, all grades? Sure. That's usually the answer for epic teachers. I just wanted to ask. Um Just because as of actually today, um the K through two courses have been given, let me go in here and find it so we can look at the same time. So if you're teaching K through two in the activities as a teacher, you'll see this course resource folder at the very top, you'll notice it's automatically hidden from the students. Should you want to show anything to the students you'll need to go in and allow students to see that. Um But within here, they have given an optional pacing guide. So this will help assist walking through the platform and knowing when things should be due. Um This is just kind of a basis should you need it? But if you're using a continuous course, it will pace out for the student. So with the continuous course, it's unique to each student. Of course, if one student starts in August and another student starts in September and they're still gonna take the entire course, they're gonna have a few more things due. Um But it really depends usually with the grades three through 12, it seems to be about one activity per day. But again, it's really dependent on the subject matter and what needs to be completed and things like that. Is it easy to modify those assignments for our fed kids? Like reduce questions or reduce answer choices? Yes, absolutely. So not on the teacher end and it might depend on what your uh um abilities within the administrator application are. So we'll look at those together once we switch over to the teacher side. Um but there's four accommodations that an administrator can set to each user. So with that, let me go over here. So when you have access to the users tab at the very bottom of the details, this is the four accommodations that can be set per user and this is across all of their courses. So never automatically assign zeros that's not going to be on anything by default. That's if a teacher goes into their course and decides they want to automatically assign zeros after past due activities, this student wouldn't be affected. You can also ignore any time limits on assessments. Should there be any also always allow speech stream that has been turned on across the board for epic? But should a teacher want to turn it off per course or per activity, then the student will still have access and then you can also limit the number of options on multiple choice questions. So if I put two here, then this student would only ever see two options across all multiple choice questions. But the another option that just became new available this year is those accommodated courses which will reduce those number of questions across all quizzes and practice tests and unit tests for students. Ok. This, that's fantastic. Um Can you just tell me one more time how you got here. And so this is just, you're just modifying this for Aaron Sullivan, right? So if I had 2/5 graders, one could have these accommodations and the other could go without them. Correct. Yes, ma'am. These are unique to each user. Um I didn't explain how I got here just because I wanted to make sure with lita that y'all had the ability to do this or is this something that you'll have to request by? Epic? Y'all do have specific teacher admin level permissions. Um But just because the school year ended, I wasn't ab actually able to see exactly what y'all have permissions on. Um And with, I'm not able to share my screen right now and show just because I would be showing student data if I were to go into y'all's actual site. So in your administrative settings, if you have the ability, you would just access. Um So right when you log in, you get the option of an admin or a teacher. If you accidentally click on teacher or you're already working in the teacher platform, you can use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner and that will allow you to switch over from admin to teacher if you're enrolled in as a student, that's how you'd switch to a student as well. So you'll want to be in the admin app and then you'll use that main menu and click down to the users tab and these are all fake students. I'm still in the training site. Um But you would click on the user id of your student and then scroll to the bottom and it's all right there for you. The only reason I say this is, I believe the last time that this was asked, y'all didn't have access to it so you can view it when it's here, but everything is grayed out. I don't know if that's been changed or not or if you all have access to it, but if you don't and it's all grayed out, you would just request that from Lida and, or another administrator. It's not lita um and they can come in here and add these accommodations per user for you. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I'm gonna switch back to the student app really quick. Did anyone else have any remaining questions before we switched over to the teacher's side? Megan? I wanted to mention, did you want to show the calendar how they can filter per day, week and month? Absolutely. That's a great one, Sophia. So I'm gonna go back to the calendar icon. Uh I'm sorry, calendar tab in the main menu. Um What Sophia was referring to is that if a student was on a specific day. So right now it's just gonna show the day that I'm clicking on. But if I come up here in the right hand corner where it labels the day, I can switch down to a week. So then if I'm just on this week, it'll still show me that Friday due date. If I click into this week, it'll show me everything due for this week or I can even show myself an entire month. That way the student doesn't have to be on the day and click into each day in order to see everything. Do. Thank you, Sophia. Of course, we have one more question from Andrea. Can we omit an activity for specific students and keep it for others? Yes, absolutely. So we'll just go ahead and switch over to the teacher side. A lot of the questions I think y'all are asking even prior to the training were in regards to the editor. So we'll go in there and look in that and then you all can see all of the different options of what you have for students. I'm gonna flick right back really quick. Is this where you were looking? Sophia was on the Yes and the chat. OK, perfect. I just wanted to make sure there was no questions in regards to the student application before I moved on student application looks good. All right. So again, in order to switch over to a different permission set from admin teacher student, you would use this waffle icon in the top right hand corner next to your name and then click over to switch. Um I forgot that I didn't enroll myself as a teacher So I'm actually going to log in as a teacher that I enrolled in the course. So one second, early credit. 223. Ok. All right. So this is very similar to what yours should look like. You should have admin or teacher. I'm gonna click into the teacher side and you'll notice everything looks very similar on the teacher's application that's intended so that if the students ever get lost or you need help with anything, nothing looks foreign to you. Everything is the same across the board, especially when you switch over to the administrative application as well. So I know that y'all had a lot of questions in the editor in order to get there. I'm gonna cover a couple of steps first. I just wanna make sure y'all didn't think I was forgetting about you. Um But right when you log in as a teacher, you'll still have that date here. And then um what's really great about this platform is that you'll have the needs grading right on your home page for you. So you'll have a notification of how many you have left to grade. You'll notice it's a three. Even if I click in here, I don't provide a grade for anything and I click right back out. That three is gonna remain there for me until I provide a grade for each of those three submissions. That way you don't ever have to get confused if you graded something or not it's always gonna remind you right here. You also have that announcements tab as a teacher that'll bring you to communication tab where you'll notice that there's any new announcements provided by an admin or you or another teacher created a new announcement. Um Only the teachers that are enrolled in the same courses of you that will is what you'll be notified of. So you won't be notified of other teachers that aren't in your courses. So I'm gonna click on that needs grading tab. And on the left hand side, you'll be able to see the three submissions here. And I wanted to show you the difference between these. So the first one is that first upload, I uploaded. If you remember where we showed the difference between the text or if you could use right from your device or use the upload and I chose the upload. So this is what you see as a teacher, you'll see the student's name, the course it came from, the activity is actually a hyperlink so that you'll be able to click right in there and see what the students saw as they were submitting. And then you'll also have the targeted versus submitted date scrolling down. You'll be able to see the student attachments and it keeps it all in one clean box for you. And then at the very bottom, anytime you see comments with a gray box, this is what the student also provided in the text box and then at the very bottom is a rubric provided for you. So you can actually typewrite within here grading per um section. And then you'll notice in the top right hand corner, it automatically calculates for me on the activity itself, you'll notice it's highlighted on content, clicking over to score and activity history is where I can see how many times the student submitted or I'm sorry, this is actually how many times the student visited the activity with a time stamp. But then the submission history is where you'll see that how many times they actually submitted the activity. And then all the way over to the right is class statistics. This is only applicable when more than one student has submitted and when it's in has a portion of automatic grading. So we'll look at one of those in a little bit. Um But all the way over to the right, this is where you can provide a score for the student. So I actually use the rubrics at the bottom and I'd like to keep my score. So I'm just gonna click submit score and then in the on the right hand side, you'll notice that that score populates for the student. So a seven out of eight was an 87.5%. Now, if I use this refresh in the top right hand corner, that'll refresh my list and anything that I've already graded will take out for me. So it can clear up some of that clutter. But let's say that it didn't have a rubric. So any, this is a great example of anything that's open ended, including with some of the automatic grading. So if I scroll throughout here, I can see what the student answered and what they got correct based on those automatic grading questions. But then anything that I need to grade will come to the top. So I can either use those points section where I can provide a grade and it will automatically calculate the rest of the score for me based on what the student answered or I can use this section in the top right hand corner. I can allow full credit which will give 100%. Keeping in mind it's not 100% just for these two questions. I need to grade. It's for the whole activity. So it's superseding anything they already provided as a grade. You can also allow no credit or clear out the score. You can revert to calculated, which is gonna give me that calculated score based on what they earned. You can also excuse which will take this out of the final scoring for the student's grade. They'll no longer be required to have this a part of their grade. It will excuse in the grade book and then they will no longer see it on their side. You can allow a retry again. This is only necessary should they exceed their amount that they had. So for lessons, quizzes, practices and unit test, there's a different amount that they have, but the lessons are unlimited. So you'll never need a quick allow retry for unlimited. But for the quizzes, they have two. So if they need that third additional retry, you can provide that here. You'll also then have the option to override complete. This will accept that failing score in the grade book. Should there be a reason that the student is not allowed to move forward with Epic? They should be able to move forward within the platform regardless. Um But should you ever run into that issue? You can always click override complete and then that will allow them to move on. And then at the very bottom in the right hand panel, you'll see that very familiar text box where you can insert an image video or audio as well as any emojis or text. And this will leave feedback to the t to the student and they'll see that in their notification center. So I'll click submit score and then again, I'll see that score provided and you'll also see that text box icon, the click down to my last submission. And so this is where you'll see an example. If the student just types a period or a dot exclamation point and clicks enter, you'll see that in the comments. So the comments is anything that the student has provided as an answer, you'll be able to click over to the score and activity history as well as the submission again. And then all the way over to the right underneath the feedback box, you also have the option to edit templates. So this is templates for feedback, if you click edit, that will allow you to create a template. So I'm gonna make this one for if the student did a great job in here and then you'll click done and now you have that template. So when I exit back out, instead of having to type into each students, the same feedback, I can just click right on that template and submit a score. So you'll notice you can't leave feedback unless you've also provided a score and that will populate once you provide a score at the top and then at the very bottom underneath templates, you also have returned attachments. So if you need to upload a file to attach with their feedback to the student, you can do that here as well as create a private note for yourself. So it'll remind you it is that it is hidden from the student. Should you need to remind yourself of anything here? And then you would just click submit score and again, that student would earn their score. Does anyone have any questions in regards to providing a grade for anything uploaded or um provided by the student? I had a really quick question. It was on the lesson just previous to this one that you um are showing, I think you um how to say it, but the questions weren't in order like the ones that you had to actually gray rather than multiple choice. Um You were able to pull those to the top. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. So let me go back and then can you share that again? Yes. So it's gonna look a little bit different since I already submitted the score. But anytime you see something in the needs grading tab and the students have a combination where something is automatically graded by the platform, let's say eight out of the 10 questions. But then those two questions required, a teacher answer those two will always come back to the top. Ok? So they'll always ok. All right. Very good. So anytime you're in that needs grading tab, these two questions will be at the top for you. So you don't have to go search through the questions to find out which ones they'll be. Ok. Thank you. I was thinking that that was the setting of some type but ok. Very good. No, it makes it easy for you. Thank you. Absolutely. All right. So back in the teacher app, we were in that needs grading tab. I graded everything so you can use that main menu and you'll notice that it brings you down to the Needs grading. It's just another way to get there, but I'm gonna click on the home icon to get back to the main page next to the needs. Grading to the right is the announcements tab. This is where you can come as a teacher, you'll notice it brings you straight to the communication again. It's just that quick link from your home page. So you don't have to go to the main menu. Should you not want to? Um But in the top right hand corner, you'll have this speech bubble. So it has three lines and when hovered over it says new announcement, I just zoomed in. So I'm gonna go back out a little bit so it looks normal. Um But you'll click on that new announcement and this is where you can choose. So I'm only enrolled as a teacher in one course. But if you're enrolled in more than one, which I'm sure you are, you'll have all of your courses listed here and then you can check on the check boxes for which courses you'd like this announcement to be. So you can do it for one course, for five, for 10, for all three. It just depends on what you'd like and then you'll have a start and end date or you can display it indefinitely. So you forever and then you can, it does require a subject and then that same text box. So you can include any images that you have a youtube video, any text or emoji emojis here and then you can even edit the text if you'd like, make it bigger, change the color and then you would click post in the top right hand corner and then you'll notice because I created this announcement, I can edit this announcement or delete it because these announcements were not my own. I don't have the ability to edit or delete them, but you can also always click through here and edit any ones that you've created at any time or delete them. And then you'll also notice in the top right hand corner you have that paper icon. I heard a little noise. I wanted to make sure that wasn't anybody asking a question. I don't know if it's just me hearing the noises or not, but I don't usually work with Zoom. So I'm not sure if that's like someone raising their hand or asking a question. But let me know on my side. So I think you think Sophia, I was just hearing like little bells. I don't know. OK. But anyways, so there's that little paper airplane that allows you to send mail to your students. Or if you scroll, you can select a specific student enrolled in that course. Again, the student and yourself would need to have an email in your details page of your profile, not the notification that's separate. And then um you would need to re it requires a subject and then you can send a copy to yourself as well if you'd like. And this will send straight to the students email inbox. And then I'm gonna use that main menu in the top left hand corner to go back to my home icon again. So those were all the quick links right from your page. And then as a teacher in the top right hand corner, you have managed courses which is a little double sheet of paper. And the first drop down option is to order your courses. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course, but the more courses you have, they'll populate here and you can click and drag and reorder the courses so that you can select which courses populate at the top for you. So if you have a, let's say English courses that you need to provide more grades in or some other courses that you need to be more active in, you can bring them all to the top because I know y'all are enrolled in quite a bit of courses sometimes and then scrolling through here could be time consuming. So you can order those forces from that first icon in the top right hand corner. You can also view past courses from here at the very bottom. Should you ever need to? So you still have all the same icons and you can click right into that course and view anything you need. And then lastly, you also have the ability to view slash delete courses. Um So again, we highly highly recommend never deleting anything in brighter because you never know if that's gonna delete all the scores, the grade book, anything that you need in there. Um But this is where you can just hide the course from your title. So let's say that you're still enrolled for another month, but that was little excessive for you. You didn't need it for another month and you just don't no longer want it on your page. You can just hide that from yourself. And then when you go to your home page, it's just no longer showing for you. So let's say you had 10 horses and you wanna hide five of them from yourself so that they're no longer cluttering your page. You can do that and you can always come back and unhide it from yourself as well. All the way over to the right where your name is as a teacher, you can click down and you'll have the same settings. So you also have a notification preferences very similar to the student email and or mobile number, but then you would scroll to your teacher notifications and you have the options to be notified of when a student submits something. So this is actually gonna be when a student submits anything. So it's not just any open ended or essay that require you to grade. We have put that as feedback to buzz, which is our learning management system we use um that holds the bright thinker content, but we've requested that, that be separated. So that's an option. But as of right now, this is just any time a student submits something. So now that um if a student submits an automatically graded assignment, you'll still be notified of that. Just keeping that in mind and then anytime a student's grade drops be passing or if a student's enrollment status changes. So with those three options, we highly recommend to either use email or if you specifically have T Mobile, then it's ok. But some of the other carriers, we've gotten feedback like cricket or I can't think of the other one. So via chime in if you can, but those actually notify you with separate text messages. So every single time that it's submitted, you'll get a new number, texting you. So your inbox will be full and it's just not the best sometimes. But with T Mobile, we've heard feedback and with emails, it'll all come as one text message. So uh for lack of better terms, it's one number that it comes from. So you get separate texts within one number, but you won't be bombarded with 500 different threads of texts. Um Outside of that, you also have the option to upload an image. So the students don't have this option in their avatar, you can click the plus button and choose a picture right from your profile, right from your device. So you can choose a personal picture of yourself or a picture of your dog, anything you wanna include, um, or you can choose an avatar just as the students do and then anytime you change anything in your settings, you'll wanna click save and refresh to allow those to take place. And then that'll bring you back to your main page in your main window. As a teacher in the top left hand corner, you'll have that needs grading tab, same exact from the one on the main page. You'll also have notes as a teacher very similar to the students. If you take notes in the lessons or anytime you see that notes icon, you can come back here for reference. Underneath. There is a communication that is where we were brought earlier with the announcements. It's the same page and then the calendar as a teacher also shows you anything that's due. Please keep in mind this will not be identical to the student unless your enrollment dates are identical in a continuous course. Meaning if a student isn't enrolled until August, but you have early access in July, your due dates will not line up with the students. It's gonna take your starting in date and line everything out then and again, that's only for a continuous course. So if you have a range course and you are set to set the due dates, then those will be identical to the students. Um But outside of that, everything is very similar, they are quick links, you can go to as a teacher and then you can switch between day, week and month back underneath the main page. You have a new tab that the students do not, which is the people tab. So this is going to show everyone enrolled in every single course that you have. So this will give a quick snapshot of everyone that you have access to as a student in the top right hand corner. The gear icon is where I recommend you go first. This will allow you to select what you view in the people tab. I like to turn everything on and then I click save and it's gonna give you quite a bit of options. So if you don't need everything in here, that's totally fine. You can click it off. Um But I just wanna show you all of the options that you have. So the first is the co I'm sorry. Could you, could you show me again how you got to that last screen? Yes. So I'll go back a couple of steps just in case anybody else is a little bit confused on how I got here in the main menu. In the top left hand corner, I navigated down to the people tab and then in the people tab all the way over to the right. The gear icon is how I selected what I wanted on in this page and then you click save and everything has been turned on here. So the first icon is the accommodations. Um So those ones we just spoke on earlier as far as um speech stream being turned on all the time limiting the number of questions per multiple choice um across the board for the students, all four of those are going to show the teacher right here. So I don't have any um accommodations as far as this user. So I'm actually gonna go in and turn an accommodation on really quick so we can see what that looks like. I'll turn them all on. Ok. So now that I have an accommodation set for this user as a teacher, I can click in the people tab and be able to see what those accommodations are. So accommodations for this student and then they have everything turned on and then they'll just give you notifications of those. Um And then Sophia did update me via lita since her microphone is not working, all epic courses are continuous. So I will continue the training with just speaking on continuous courses to not confuse you. So sorry about that before, but everything will be automatically paced out for the students. So based on their enrollment start and end date, everything will pay for them. So that is true. If you're given early access as a teacher and you don't have the exact enrollment dates as a student, it'll be a little bit different in the calendar just keeping that in mind. Um But next to the accommodations you can see the overall score the student has and let's say this right. Thinker student was enrolled in four different courses. They will actually populate four different times and the course that you're looking at will be listed right underneath their name. So for this specific course, this is their score and amount of time they spent there, I can see their understanding, interest and effort level. If they completed their heart, heart icon and the date it was changed and then scrolling over, I can see the progress and mastery. The online indicator is my personal favorite. This will show me any time a student is logged in at the exact same time as me. And then you also have the pace and performance indicated by a green yellow or red dot So this student's pace is on schedule, but their performance is currently failing in the courses. And then you can see any badges and anything that any badges they earned, anything today that they submitted any failed assignments or late as well and then the end date for this student. So this is the quickest way to come and see. The last date that the student has to submit is December 28th 2022 for this course and then back up in the left hand corner to the main menu underneath the people. Tab is our customer support link. So this is where you can come and click. This will bring you right to a new tab and this is where you can either provide feedback, report, an issue or a bug or submit a help ticket. Um So we actually also have access to your Epic quick start guide, which I'm gonna open really quickly, which has been beautifully updated by LITA. Um But everything in here is specific to Epic and bright thinker. So any questions that you may have, it can easily be found in here and you can click control, find and just type in anything that you need to find and it will update here for you. I'm not saying that we are not here to help you with any additional questions. It's just a quick guide to help you. Should you need it. And I'm sure Leah can provide that link if anybody doesn't have it. And then back in the main menu underneath the customer support tab, we're actually gonna skip over clipboard for today. It's a little bit more advanced. Um but I'm gonna click on the more reports option. So this will allow you to pull a PDF version of any of these reports. So we have a student daily activity of progress and a grade details. So I'll show you an example of what that looks like the student daily Activity report. It's gonna show you time stamps of everywhere. The student was logged into the platform and how long and then the grade details report will give you a quick overview of the course that the students in. So a course grade their progress and then all of the grades that they have earned thus far. And again, those can be found in your more reports. Tab lastly, you have access to that student resources identical to the students on their side. Should you need it? And then your any courses you're enrolled in will populate in the bottom left hand corner as well with a color co ordination. I'm gonna click back on the home icon and now we're gonna focus on the course card. So yours similar to the student, but you have extra access. So you'll still have a course card with the image coordinating to each course, the course title as well. And then you have the activities icon, your grade book, the reports for each course, which is different from the more reports tab. You also have the people tab from here, which is a more in depth look of the people tab. So the one from your main menu is gonna encompass all of the students. This one is just for this course and then you also have the editor. So I'm gonna click on the play button first is very similar to the student. This is where you come and you can use the pencil icon to edit the landing page. So you can put anything you want here, you can change this daily, weekly, monthly, leave it the entire year, whatever is best for you and then scrolling down, you'll be able to access the activities just as a student does. So for example, if you wanted to come in here and view this eighth grade language, arts activity, you can see it exactly as the students see it. But even further in the top right hand corner, you can see that you're viewing ads yourself if you click here and the first drop down is view ads. This allows you to select a specific student. So I know that my student has already completed it. I'm gonna select, ok. Now I can see the score, they see I can go down to their submission. I'm able to see exactly what they have submitted. I can see that they have a retake available to them and I can even view their grade details as well. So this is the quickest way you'll be able to confirm a few different things without having to log in with credentials of a student or ask them on their end. You'll be able to just see right from here. I'm gonna use the back arrow in the top left hand corner to be brought back to the main page. And then this is just where you'll come. If you wanna do anything in the course such as the students, I'm gonna use the main menu in the top left hand corner. And now that I have selected this specific course, you'll notice my menu changed again. So this is the sub menu just for this course, the same icons we saw on the course card on the main page. So I'm gonna click down to the grade book. There's a couple cool features in here in the top right hand corner, you have a gear similar to how you have in the people tab. This is where you can select what you'd like to see in your grade book so you can choose user name. The last time the students logged in minutes spent in the course accommodations, um any progress or enrollment status and then any footers that you want. So if there's missing or low scores, anything like that and then at the very bottom, you'll have a box titled tools. This will allow you to export to a different course. So again, I'm only enrolled in one course. It's not gonna show me any other courses, but you'll have a list of other courses with check boxes and you can export the same settings you just chose here to all of your other courses. So you don't have to click into the grade book settings for each of your courses and change all of the settings. It'll just across the board, change for you. And then anytime you make changes, you wanna click save here and everything will apply. So I see that same accommodations flag I saw in the people tab, you can click there and view what those accommodations that student has their score per activity. And then in the top right hand corner next to the gear icon, once to the right is your lightning bolt which enables quick editing. This allows you to click any cell in the grade book, whether it has already earned a score been provided by you or is blank and you can enter in a score right from here. So you type in the score and click enter, you also can enter in an X and that will automatically excuse the assignment. So when someone asked earlier, if you can excuse an assignment for one student, but not all of the everyone in the course, this will be the quickest way, especially if you only have a couple assignments that you're trying to excuse for the student. This will allow you to go in and excuse and then you'll wanna make sure to turn that lightning bolt off so that you can go back in and not be affecting the score. Should you not want to anymore? Next to the lightning bolt is a tool. Um A wrench icon when clicked on this will allow you to export your scores. Should you need them in a CS V file? So it's just an Excel spreadsheet. I'll go ahead and export it so we can see what it looks like. Should you need the scores externally? It'll just show you that quickly for you outside of here. I'm gonna click and back into the grade book. So this is where you can do a couple different things. If you click into any scores already earned, this will show you the same tab as the needs grading tab we saw earlier. So you can come and adjust grades as you had before. You can edit your templates and then you can view with the submission history and the score activity from here if it is something that was automatically graded, so I'll go into the quiz, you'll be able to see all the answers. So you had not provided a score for this. This is automatically graded. Um but you do have the ability to change the score. So should, for whatever reason you decide that this student should earn court points for the justice question. You can go in and adjust the points for that question. It'll automatically update the score and you will need to click submit if you wanna save that score and then you'll notice the updates already for you. Another really cool thing in the grade book is if you click on the actual title of each of the activities on the click on quiz two, this will bring me into the stats. So if I had multiple students, it would list them all here the last time they logged in their status and score. But if I click over to analytics on the top, right, then I can scroll and see how the students answered. So again, I only have one student in here. But this will give me class statistics, 100% of this class answered the question wrong. This is the correct answer and so on, you can see 100% answered correctly. So if I decide that the students were not fairly questioned on this quiz, and I want to remove the question from score, I can do that here. And that will automatically give scoring back to each of the students that got the answer incorrect. So then if I use the back arrow, we can see the student did get that question incorrect. So now their score went up even higher automatically without me having to do anything else. Does anyone have any questions in regards to the grade book, how to change anything, anything like that? Perfect. So I'm gonna click back on the main menu in the top left hand corner underneath the grade book is the reports tab. These are all per course and will pull as a CS V file. So none of these are gonna be the PDF that would be in the more reports on the main menu. Um but this will allow you to pull a, a report on the grade book or the student in regards to performance on all of their courses or just in specific courses. Um Should you need any reports externally and then back in the menu menu underneath the reports is again another people tab, but this one is unique to this course. So it's only going to show you the students enrolled in this course and you'll notice I don't have all the options again just because it's a completely different people tab. I would need to go into that gear icon in the top right hand corner and select what I'd like to see on this people tab. But in the main menu, the last option when in a course is the editor. So this is how you're gonna come and see a lot of different things for bright thinker in the bottom left hand corner, you'll see a carrot right here to expand the left panel right now. I'm just in a course for actually, I have a meeting. But let me go back out, I'm just in a demo. So I actually don't have any standards aligned, but I'm gonna go into an Oklahoma course. So you can see what that would look like. So let's just pull up fourth grade El A. So when you're in the editor, let's say this is your actual course. You'll use that expansion arrow and then all of the standards that align with fourth grade El A for Oklahoma will be right here. But then when you open each unit, you'll be able to see what is covered for activity. So thats gonna be how you view standards within the course itself again in the editor and then you just expand on the left hand side to view, but I'm gonna go back really quick to the Doma demo. And then within each course, when you want to view something in the activity list, you'll need to open that unit folder with the carrot button and then that's how you'll see those activities in order to view correct questions. There's two ways you can do that in writing, thinker. So with any activities that have automatic grading like this, 4th, 8th grade, El A, I'm gonna use that pencil icon all the way to the right. And that will allow me to access all of the details and I'll click over to the questions tab and these are all the correct answers. Another way to view the correct answers on the exit out of here is it will be listed right beneath it. So if it's an upload, that isn't unique to a student answer, it's not gonna have 100 different possibilities of an answer. For example, math, it'll just have one or two. depending on the content, you will have an answer key listed right below. You can see this in the activities page as well actually. Um But when you're in the editor, you will go all the way over to the right using that triple dots and click preview. And this will allow you to preview the correct answer sheet for that activity. So this is an example of an activity, the student would upload work. There's only one possible right answer. So you'll have that answer key. When grading, I'm gonna click the back arrow in the top left hand corner. So again, the two different ways is either if it's already automatically graded and it has the answers in the platform, you use that pencil icon to go to the questions tab or if it has the answer key right beneath it, you'll use the triple dots all the way over to the right and preview underneath there. So all the way over to the right, you have three different icons. The first is an eyeball. So this will automatically excuse that assignment for everyone enrolled in the course. So let's say you wanted to hide the entire unit, the unit is closed here. So then I could just click the eyeball. And when I spanned the unit, everything within the unit is going to be hidden from the students. If you uncheck that eyeball, everything is then revealed again. So the benefit of the eyeball is if half the students have worked in there and half have not, if you hide the activity, everything will be taken out of the grade book, the students will no longer be able to see it, they'll not be required to work. But if you reveal it at any point, then all of those scores are able to come back. So that's why we recommend using the eyeball instead of deleting because it's kind of a safety net for you. But then you can also hide just the lessons within here or you can hide just one quiz. Um But keeping in mind any of the eyeballs here will hide from everyone in the enrolled in the course. So all students then next to the eyeball icon is that pencil editor outside of the questions tab, this is where you can see the settings. So all the settings across the board have been set for Epic. Um These are not Epic settings, these are just my demo course settings. Um But the number of temps is already there for you. Everything across the board has been submits this activity. I know last year there were some issues. If you're a returning teacher that students weren't able to move forward, it was making you grade things, we've changed that across the board. So students should be able to submit and move forward regardless of the score they received regardless if there's anything to grade or not. Um And then the passing score has been set to 60 as well. So everything can be found in that pencil icon to the right of the eyeball and then all the way over to the right of there is the triple dots. This will allow you to preview the activity. You can also move up or down or to a different unit. Should you need to, you can duplicate the activity as well or you can copy it to your library. So when you click copy to my library on the right hand side. If this isn't already expanded, you'll have another Carrot here to expand and the icon all the way over to the right is my library and you'll notice that copied in right here. The benefit is that we'll stay with you as a user. So if you would want to use this in a different course, at any point in time, you'll always have that activity with you, especially if you customize it from scratch or you need a completely different activity, you can copy it to your library and then that allows you to click and drag anywhere you'd like to have it. Um I have a quick question. Um And I'm sure you, you probably already said this. So I apologize but um when you click the pencil and then you can edit those settings and you can edit like how many attempts and stuff. What um this is all standard. So like is our default gonna be that they'll have two attempts. Um So let me go in. It is going to be the default for you, but the ones that we were looking at were not already epic settings. These are though. So let me go in here. So actually for lessons, the students have unlimited attempts for epic. But yes, this is where you would go to see the default settings that were already set um And or change them. Should you need to? Ok. So we're giving students unlimited attempts on assignments on lessons category. Yes, on the lessons. Ok, thanks. Yep. And then um further in there with that epic quick start guide again, if you do not have access to it, I'm sure lita already put the link in the chat. Um But at the very bottom is where all the settings are. So if you wanted to come and, and I think these are already updated. Yes. So they said changing to 60% for the school year. Um But everything in here is the settings that have already been applied by default to your courses. So that's at the very bottom of the quick start guide. Ok. And where is the quick start guide? One more time? I'm gonna a bookmark it. That's OK. I actually don't have the link to provide but lita if you don't mind putting that in the chat, I think she already did. Yeah. So if you see the chat of the zoom that we're in. Lita provided it in there, I also included it on the epic one bright thinker channel. Perfect. Thank you Lida. OK. So let me exit back out of there. Um So that is how you can move things around from the far, right, the triple dots, you're able to move things around copper library. Again, we highly recommend delete, not deleting, not to know. Um But you can also click and drag. So let me open a full instructional unit so we can see um keeping in mind if I click and drag this qui quiz two to be before quiz one, everything is meant to be in sequential order for bright thinker. So everything in quiz two encompasses less than 45 and six or whatever was prior to it. So if I go down here less quiz three is in company encompassing 78 and nine. So if I move it before those, the students are gonna be quizzed on things they might not have ever seen. So just keep that in mind when you're moving things around and editing and adding in your own things. Um and then at the very bottom left hand corner, the add activity. So it's kind of hard to see. Um but it's the very last option on your syllabus, you can click add activity and then anything in the first 3rd and 4th quadrants. So the L shape at the bottom will be blank. So you can add in an assessment and activity file attachment, youtube video and it will not contain anything in regards to bright thinker. So that's how you can um customize your own activities, add in flash cards, a journal, anything you like here. But then in the top right hand corner where it says library, you will be able to access your master courses. So you'll click open on that file. It'll take a minute because it's actually opening every single course that bright thinker offers. So let's say you are teaching fourth grade science and you want to supplement some third grade science and you can open this uh course, you can open any of the units that you wanna view and you can even preview the lesson before adding it in. So you'll scroll through, make sure this is the lesson you wanna add in. Then you'll click add to cart. It's not gonna cost any money. It's just the titling system they used. You'll have to click the cart button in the top right hand corner and then you'll always wanna click link. The difference is that link will link it back to the master so that any updates we make, it'll still come through to yours. All of the images will come through and all of the video as well as well. Um And the way that you can ensure that it was actually linked in is you'll see that little link icon. So actually all of these have it because I linked them in versus if it was already in your course, it does not have that little link icon thing. Um But then that will come in and you can click and drag that wherever you should need it. And then let's say you already have a lesson to. You'll wanna click on the pencil icon and you can change the title and then it'll look as if it was always there for the student. The only thing indication that it has come from a different grade level is state specific courses. Oklahoma. Third grade history, it'll actually show that it says third grade history in the lesson itself. That's something that can't be changed. Um And then all of the K through two courses have little videos throughout and they actually have a title with the grade level in there. But other than that, the title of the actual lesson um within the lesson itself for third through fifth grade outside of Oklahoma, it's not going to tell them that this came from a lower grade level or a higher grade level, whatever you're going from, I'm gonna click back out of here. So that is pretty much everything within the editor syllabus section. But then you'll notice in the top there's a couple different tabs. So I'm gonna click over to weights. This is where you can view the category weights. So again, I'm gonna use actually a different course, for example, because mine's not a great one. Um But you'll be able to see how the course is waited. So you have lessons, quizzes, practice as a unit test and then you'll even be able to open those and see what is encompassing between those. So you can ensure that you know that that lesson is 25% of their overall grade versus this unit test is 50. Um These are not epic settings. These are my demo ones. Again, let me go and see what epics are. Oh, actually they are. Yep. Epic uses the same one. So it's 2525 0 50 for lessons, quizzes, practices and human tests. And then next to that, we have the activity list. So this is within the editor. Let me close. I'm actually gonna get out of here. So I don't actually change anything in our master. Um But in the activity list, this is where you can come and filter so you can type in quiz. Um You can type in lesson anything you want to change all at one time. Um And just keeping in mind that when you type in lesson, that's also gonna populate the answer key and things like that. So just be aware of what's populating on that list, but I'll do a quiz for an easy example and then you can check box the box at the very top right hand corner and that will check everything on for you. And then in the top right where that pencil icon is to bulk edit, that will allow you to do a couple different things in bulk. So if it's grayed out, that's not allowing you to do that in bulk, just because a specific there might be one or that whole activity type is not allowing you to do it in bulk for whatever reason. But if that check box lets you check it on, then this is how you can quickly do a couple different things in the platform. So who the activity is visible to that is the eyeball icon. So this is hiding, if you change to teachers only or teachers and observers, it will hide from all of the students. So it's automatically excusing for all of the students at one time, everything that you checked on, you can also change the location. So if you wanna put all of these quizzes to one folder and move everything at one time, you can do that. You can also change the passing score quickly from here. Again, it's set to 60 for epic. But if you want to, if there's a couple quizzes that were off and you wanna make sure they're all 60 you can do that here. Um assessment password. If you want to require the students to enter a password before they take the assessment. Again, this is going to encompass everything that you check on for. So it would be required to be across the board. And then you can also change the number of attempts for quiz. It's currently two, but you can put in custom and change the amount here as well. You'd wanna click the check box confirming that you understand it's permanent update and then that will automatically update all of the items that you checked on there for you. Um Also from this tab, you can preview, so using that triple dots, you'll, you're able to preview this assessment, should you want to before you edit it and then all the way over to the right is group settings. So this was a question that someone had in regards to how to hide maybe an entire unit from one student instead of everybody at the same time. So the lightning bolt in the grade book that we spoke on earlier is the quickest way to excuse one or a few activities from one student or a couple students. Um depending on what you're doing. But if you need to hide an entire unit or a couple units, that might be a little conti time consuming in the grade book. So you can create groupings um within the group settings, you would need to click the wrench icon in the top right hand corner and down to manage groupings and this will allow you to add a group. So for example, I'm just going to put start dates here. So I'm gonna have a few students that are starting at different dates and I might wanna hide some things from them. So the group creation method, I'm gonna do a fixed number of groups because I want there to specifically be two groups. But you can also do a target number of students per group. And then you can select how many students are in groups and that'll based off of how many groups there are. Um And then the group assignment I always select none because I want to choose which students go into which groups. But you can depending on which types of groups you're creating, select random round robin alphabetical the same or different by performance and, or um by the different quarters. Um top or bottom, things like that. So I'm gonna click generate with none. And so then it's automatically gonna give me an, a title right here in the top right hand corner where you have the edit groups with the pencil, you can change this title that it automatically gave you. So I'm gonna title this August, my students that are starting in August and then I'm actually gonna have some more students starting later. So I'll use this little people with the plus button to add a group and then again, I can edit that name and let's say these students start in September. Perfect. So I'm gonna put my student in one group. If for whatever reason, the type of groups that you're determining, you can check off this box and allow your student to be encompassed in both groups. Um But I just want one. So then I'll click save and you'll assign all your students to whichever group you need. And now I have my start date groups. So I'm gonna click the back arrow and then you'll notice you're choosing your grouping. So if you have multiple groups, you can select which one you're affecting right now and then where you're at and then view by either the property, the activity itself, which is the group or the groups will align on the right hand side. So I like to be in property. It's the least confusing for me personally. And then you can either you can change the visibility. So this is only for my students starting in August and this is only for my students starting in September and which groups I put them in. So now I can go in and I'm actually only in the core content, but I'll go back up to the full course. I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in September or I can hide this entire unit from my students starting in August. That way you can hide multiple units, multiple activities from specific groups of students and you don't have to do it from your main page, hiding it from everyone. And I know we went through that rather quickly. We do have a PDF walking through every step and what everything means. And of course, if you have any questions and there's interest in the need of an advanced workshop, we can always do that as well. But I'm gonna go back to my questions tab that you all had um on questions that you asked. And then Sophia, if there's anything in the chat that's not in here, please let me know. Um I, I have a quick question on the groups. Is that something that you said we'll talk more about in the advanced class? Yes. OK. And we have a PDF as well. That kind of gives like a description in depth of every option that you can select. And also this year we're gonna talk about um during office hours uh at the beginning of the year, Megan and Sophia have agreed to join us the first week um on one of the days. So if you have questions or as you guys are getting into it with students and have questions, you can join us as well. But then also um throughout the year, we're going to have specific skills that kind of go along with that time of year uh that we will highlight and um do a video tutorials on as well during office hours. Yes. And the benefit of office hours that we've done in the past is it gives us the opportunity that we only um have one teacher in the, we have the ability to only have one teacher in the zoom meeting at one time and we don't record those. So that way if you have a specific question and you need to share your screen with student data, something's going on with your specific student, we can walk through that and look at your screen together um outside of a group setting where we can't share student data. OK. So I'll just start from the top. One of the questions that was asked is how can we edit calendar pacing for the to do list but not affect the course and date to prevent the course from expiring. Um So the only way to edit the to do list is if you're in a range course mode and that allows you to edit all end dates. But the difference with that is it doesn't give um pacing for the students. And so all of the courses for Epic right now are currently in continuous. So you would not be able to edit those to do estate um outside of changing their enrollment and dates, which is I know was a part of the question said not to. So, but if you do change the enrollment starter and date, that will obviously change the pacing for the student, um I might need a little bit clarification on the next question, but I will go off what I think you're asking and then if you're in the zoom call, let go ahead and let me know if I'm incorrect. But the next question is, can parents slash students change from their app if they want to work ahead? So Epic actually doesn't um for lack of better terms, gate students. So you can work as far ahead as you want and they actually don't even have to work in sequential order. So the students are able to work wherever whenever, as far ahead as they want. That was from a question who from someone who said she wasn't able to make it. Ok. Hopefully you are watching the video back and then if you have another question um or I didn't answer that correctly, please just let Lita or myself know and we can further discuss that. And then the next question was where can I hide things from student view? We covered that in the course editor with the eyeball icon. Even further, you can also hide things from students using the lightning bolt in the grade book with the X and enter and that will excuse it from a specific student. Um How can I change the number of attempts on quizzes, practices or exams? Um That's what we covered earlier, either by the pencil icon in the settings or in that activity list of the editor where you can do multiple things at one time and then same thing with the past threshold, it's gonna be in those settings or in the bulk editing feature. Will the K through two have social studies and science? Um We do provide social studies and science on the bright thinker side from K through two. It might just be that lita and the team are working on them. So you might not see them in the demo just yet, but we do offer them. Um And then can you show us how students take notes? We did cover that in the student side. But if you are still confused on that or have a question, please let me know is there a specific writing course for fourth through eighth to match PS grade books? Lita you might need to help me with that one. I'm not sure what a PS grade book is. The PS is Power School. Um, got it. Yeah, we're doing the, the talking back and forth between, uh, bright thinker and power school to automatically load the grades. So they have to have the same settings and the same forces. Got it. Ok. But I think four through eight we just have English. Correct. Yes. Mhm. As far as what brand thinker offers? Yes. And then is there a general supply list? And that was already answered, they will be shared on the bright thinker channel of epic one. I did wanna mention some of the supply lists as far as we know what you have access to might not be updated just because they have updated all of those courses as of this year. Um So if you're a teacher looking for a supply list, let me go back into the platform at the top of I closed it out. Let me go back in really quick. At the top of any of your courses, you have the ability to view the supply list, the teacher guides, anything like that. So for a K through two course, when you're in the activities, you'll have course resources as a teacher, this one has a pacing guide and then underneath each unit will have the teacher guide and a unit workbook for the students to be able to print everything they need. Should they need it. But in that teacher guide for K through two is where you can find the supply list in here. Um If they have any that's needed and then they also give you supplemental material. Should you wanna add anything outside of what is already covered? And then for those older grade levels, I'll pull up an example. We'll go to fre map. I don't think that fifth grade math will have a supply list, but anything that is needed at the top will be in a PDF for you. Um So this is gonna let you know the course manipulatives needed um throughout the course. And then I know for like some of those higher level courses like biology, they also have course resources at the top. So um teacher guidelines with, with or without the lab manual and then if there's any principles, those will also be within the unit as well. So right within the course, it'll hold that supply list or anything that the students need. Um So we recommend definitely going into the course itself once you have access to them to ensure that's everything that's updated for your specific courses. Um But we are working to update those supply list that you have access to Rita. Ok. And I have access to those courses, so I should be able to pull those. Correct. Absolutely. Mhm. Ok. Um And then one other thing too is last year Lindsay went in and found the, um, the novels that are required for each of the, the uh classes and she put together a tablet that has access to those novels as well. How wonderful. That is awesome. Um, the, yes, the required reading list. I think you have access to this one later, but this will list out everything that's externally required as far as a novel in each grade level and where it's used in each unit as well. Um Let me see where we left off. Is there an upload limit? So I took note of that. I don't believe that there is especially not what the students would be uploading. Um But again, I'll check with Buzz RL MS just to make sure um lita before our advanced workshop, if you have time, let's schedule a time so that we can discuss the admin level permissions that teachers have. Um Just because no one is currently enrolled in courses. So I wasn't able to see that and I didn't want to misanswer anything. Ok. Ok. Awesome. The next question was about how many activities per subject can students expect a week? So again, that's gonna be dependent on their start and end date. As far as the continuous course, it'll automatically pace everything out for them. But if there is a pacing guide at the top of the course for K through two or externally for these other courses, that'll help you just get an idea of what's due and how much is due and then how can the teacher see what standards are covered that's gonna be in that editor. But of course, if you have any questions on how to get back there, let me know and I'll show that again. Sophia, was there any questions in the chat that were not covered in the spreadsheet or what we just discussed? No, I believe you covered it all. Ok. Awesome. Did anybody else have any remaining questions? I have. Oh, go ahead. Ok, real quick. Um, I just added a question. I don't even know if you can see it yet, but are we able to get a copy of that required reading list? Like the books that are required? Yeah. Um, lita, I will send an email over to you and then however you want to make that available. I'll let that be up to Epic. Ok. Thanks. And thank you. Of course. I think someone else had a question at the same time. It, was that the same one or do you have a different one? Uh, yeah, I just kind of maybe wanted your input or some, maybe some other, uh, if there's any other special education, uh, Epic teachers. I've got kind of mixed reviews from teachers who have used. Right. Thinker in the past. Um, some of them are like, it's overwhelming that the additional, uh, like supplies and stuff that they'll need, you know, offline in the curriculum and then some people, um, are like, no, it's usually just like basic stuff that's laying around the house, like for science experiments or for other projects and different subjects. Um I'm primarily gonna be using this for my K through eighth grade uh classes. So, um, did you have any, any thoughts on that? I do. Yes, I do. So, we have gotten that feedback from a lot outside of just epic. And this year was one of the major changes that the curriculum team has gone in and updated the courses and I know they're just gonna continue to be updating them. Um But they have gone in and made more accessible um labs. So let me go in here and show you Sophia. Do you remember the specific courses that they made changes to? I don't have the list on hand. I don't. Exactly, but I can check on my side also. Ok, let me see if I can find an example. Let's talk about them. Ok. So they've gone in, I think it was the higher grade levels in eighth grade, which is not helping you specifically. I'm sorry about that. But I, they might have changed eighth grade as well. Um But I know that they're going in and they're making more virtual labs, more things accessible to students that are um at home, not using the labs specifically in a classroom. Um But if you still see any remaining labs, you are more than welcome to hide them and if you have other labs that you'd like to use, please feel free to do that. But I know that the curriculum team is going in and they're updating some of those so that they are more accessible because there are a few that require things like um a balance beam that students might not have access to or a microscope and different things like that. So, ok, that was my kind of my follow up thought there was maybe to just omit it if it was too complicated and that won't have too big of an impact on. I mean, it'll have an impact but not too big of an impact on their grade or. Well, I guess if you admit it, it won't have any impact on their grade but correct, but it wouldn't be hindering them from learning anything for like a specific quiz or la um test or anything like that. All the labs are separate. So the quizzes will just cover the lessons themselves and then the practice and unit test will cover the quizzes and um lessons. OK. Good, good to know. And it's really easy to going through the editor to add a dry lab too if you wanted to. Um So if you have like a video like on youtube, that maybe corresponds to what the lab was, you can upload that with some questions that they can then do in lieu of the lab that's listed there. OK. Good idea. In that advanced workshop, we'll be covering more in depth on the different types of activities. You can create how to do those groupings, more in depth, how everything applies to each other. So in the meantime, from this um meeting to the next, if you have any questions for LITA or you're like, I really wanna learn more advanced on this. Please let us know and we'll make sure to cover that in the next training and we'll keep the spreadsheet open. So if you uh go away and come back with some more questions, you can update that spreadsheet and we'll definitely keep looking at that for uh the next training as well. Awesome. I just wanted to give a couple of seconds to make sure nobody had any other questions, but it seems like they've all been answered. So me and Lida will meet together before our next meeting and make sure that I'm aware of all of the settings that you'll have access to as far as um in regards to your administrative training or your administrative application so that I can fully answer all your questions. We'll go in more in depth as far as um the different types of activities you can create in epic specifics. And then as long as everybody has access to that epic quick start guide, I think that will be very beneficial to you. All the required reading actually might be right within that quickstart guide if I remember correctly but um I will send that in an email to LITA and then she will inform you on where that is available. But thank you for all your time today. It has been a pleasure and yes, le to put in the chat. The next meeting is Wednesday, August 10th and I have one, just one note about that August 10th. I believe that is a professional development epic professional development day. Ok. Does that mean you all have a lot of other trainings that day as well? Yeah, we have to travel to Oklahoma City that day, but the way they do it now, I think it's just by teams. I'm not sure if it's everyone. Uh Luta, do you know, will we just watch the recording if, if that's the case? Yes, I'll definitely make sure everything's recorded and available and if you wanted to, if you've got questions that you want us to cover and you're not able to go, you can always add up to that spreadsheet and we'll make sure that we cover it in, in the course as well. Ok. Awesome. Thank you for the input. I had no idea. So, yes, the next meeting would be August 10th at 1 p.m. If you're welcome. If you're able to join, we would love to have you. But of course, if not, we'll report it again and make sure you get that. That is all I have to share for you today. Lida. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? Um No, I just thank you guys for joining us and having these great questions and conversations. It's definitely we wanna make sure it's tailored for what you guys need. So awesome. Thank you so much.\")]\n"
